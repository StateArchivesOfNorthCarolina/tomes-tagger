Dear Ms. Mariani,

The Office of Citizen Services is in receipt of your e-mail correspondence to Governor Bev Perdue.

For your information, the Office of Citizen Services is responsible for responding to inquiries and complaints that are within the jurisdiction of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. This office also administers the CARE-LINE (1-800-662-7030) which is a statewide, toll-free information and referral telephone service. Our office serves as a clearinghouse for information on the many human service programs offered in this state. The CARE-LINE Information and Referral Service as well as our e-mail service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including holidays. I also want to make you aware of the NCcareLINK. Please visit <https://www.NCcareLINK.gov> for your connection to up-to-date information about programs and services offered across North Carolina.

In your email you have questions in regards to your son's unemployment benefits. He may apply for unemployment benefits through the Wake County Employment Security Commission at (919) 212-3849 or online at <https://www.ncesc.com/home.asp>. If he has already applied and is awaiting a decision, any eligibility questions should be directed to that local Employment Security Commission.

You also mentioned that the family does not current have health insurance. Questions about COBRA coverage should be directed to the U.S. Department of Labor at www.dol.gov/ebsa or at 1-866-444-3272 <http://www.dol.gov/ebsa%20or%20at%201-866-444-3272>.

Also, Medicaid is the only state supported health insurance in North Carolina. While there are a number of programs and services funded by the Department of Health and Human Services, all in-take, including eligibility, is administered by a local Department of Social Services (DSS). I encourage you or your son to contact his local DSS in the county in which he is currently residing to determine eligibility and make an application. †To locate contact information for his local Social Services office, please visit the following website: <http://www.dhhs.state.nc.us/dss/local/>.

If their family income and/or resources are over the limit and they have high medical bills, they may still qualify for Medicaid and have a Medicaid deductible. A Medicaid deductible is much like a private insurance deductible. You must pay a certain amount of medical bills before insurance pays. Unlike private insurance, the Medicaid deductible is based on your income. If your countable income is more than the Medicaid income limit, you will have a deductible. A Medicaid deductible is met by adding up medical costs. Payments for medical care, supplies and prescriptions may apply to your deductible. You will be authorized for Medicaid on the date that the bills add up to the amount of the deductible. You will be authorized to receive Medicaid through the end of the 6 month certification period.

Information regarding Medicaid eligibility can also be found at <http://www.dhhs.state.nc.us/dma/medicaid/who.htm>. He may download applications from the website and mail or take in the completed packet to your local Department of Social Services.

Upon receiving your e-mail I searched our database for additional agencies and organizations that offer programs which may be of assistance to your son's family. I have included program and contact information for these agencies below. I encourage you or your family to reach out to staff in these offices as they may know of other avenues of assistance for which our office is not aware.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing to you today as a very concerned mother. I live in NY state and my son Steven Kishpaugh, his wife Margie and their four young children live in Wake Forest, NC.

Unfortunately, Steve was layed off from his job on 4/30/09. To date he has not received any unemployment benefits and has not received anything from COBRA.

The whole procedure has been very stressful to the family and they are currently draining their savings to live.

My son has always been a hard worker and a good provider.

It was quite by accident that I learned of his circumstances being his pride wouldn't allow him to tell me.

When I learned my 8 yr old grandson couldn't play baseball this year because there was no money for it, my heart was broken.

They continue to call and inquire but to no avail. I think someone has dropped the ball.

At this point they have no health insurance and no unemployment coming in. ††††Please help them.

Email: nccrochet@nc.rr.com

Subject: Children's Online Safety

Comment: My name is Jami Ivey. I am a Durham resident and am a moderator for children's websites. I make sure children are safe, do not give out personal information, and are not unduly influenced by other players. I ran a sit down round table for a group of pediatricians and caregivers last year about online safety and was very pleased with the outcome. Being a mother of young children, I have noticed that there are no community lectures about online safety for children in NC. I was hoping to provide that with your blessing. I would like to go around to the public and private schools and speak with the parents and maybe even the kids. I am not sure if I should go through the PTAs, administration, the sheriff department, or with you. I would love suggestions and your support. I can get a presentation together if you would like. I think it is an important resource that our community needs. Thank you for your time, Jami Ivey nccrochet@nc.rr.com 919-667-4660

For health care, hereís from an earlier statement that can be used as a starting point, but run it by John Dervin:

I believe strongly that reform must take place at the federal level.† We have innovative solutions to providing care in North Carolina, and we have excellent providers, but our finances are stretched to the limit, so we must ensure that the financial burden of a new system cannot fall to the states.†



For beach plan, ask Jennifer Bumgarner if she has any language or guidance

BRAC Budget Reform†Commission Meets, Launches New Webpage

Gov. Perdue†on Tuesday convened the first meeting of the Budget Reform and Accountability Commission (BRAC) and launched a new Webpage, <http://brac.nc.gov/>brac.nc.gov, so that citizens may make recommendations to the commission.

‚ÄúAs North Carolina continues to be deeply affected by this national recession, state government must ensure that every tax dollar is used as efficiently and wisely as possible,‚Äù Perdue said.† ‚ÄúI look forward to working with BRAC members to meet these challenges head-on, without shying away from politically tough decisions.‚Äù

Perdue established BRAC in January via <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=429>Executive Order #5 to locate and eliminate wasteful expenditures while increasing efficiency in government.

In the short term, the commission is expected to come up with ideas that can be enacted quickly to help the state save money.† Its goal will be to have recommendations in time for next year‚Äôs legislative short session.

In the long term, BRAC will examine state government and make innovative recommendations to:

‚Ä¢ eliminate unnecessary or unsuccessful programs;
‚Ä¢ consolidate where possible and ensure we are investing effectively and efficiently;
‚Ä¢ and to streamline the way state government works.

Suggestions for initiatives that BRAC will consider may come from a variety of sources, including state agencies, BRAC members, and from the public at large.† The commission also urges citizens to make recommendations using the new Webpage, <http://brac.nc.gov/>brac.nc.gov.

Governor Rides the Bus for the First Day of School

Gov. Perdue on Tuesday took the†bus to school†with kids from Conn Elementary in Raleigh.† She talked with parents and excited kids waiting for the bus on their first day back from summer vacation.† When she arrived at the school, Gov. Perdue visited classrooms, spoke with teachers and†addressed the students†on the school's morning†TV news show.

Governor Fully Restores School Lottery Funds

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced she is fully restoring funds to the lottery capital fund for public schools.

‚ÄúWhen the national recession created a shortfall of billions of dollars, I had to turn over every stone to pay North Carolina‚Äôs bills ‚Äî to pay teachers, to keep schools and other core services running,‚Äù Perdue said. ‚ÄúWith our bills paid and the books for last fiscal year cleared out, I‚Äôm restoring the school construction lottery funds in full, which means North Carolina‚Äôs public schools will receive another $37.6 million next week.‚Äù

In February, Perdue withheld $37.6 million during the 2008-09 fiscal year from the Public School Building Capital Fund to ensure the state had sufficient resources to manage cash flow and payroll obligations. That money is being restored using funds left over from the 2008-09 fiscal year.

Gov. Perdue†Signs†Bill to Attract More Film Industry Jobs

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Thursday signed Senate Bill 943 allowing production companies a 25 percent tax credit for film projects in North Carolina, up from the previous credit of 15 percent.† The bill also sets minimum spending and hiring requirements for qualifying film companies working in the state.

‚ÄúThis legislation will help grow our $91 million motion picture industry, preserve and create thousands of jobs and increase investments in yet another emerging economic cluster,‚Äù said Perdue. ‚ÄúProviding a strong foundation for North Carolina‚Äôs film industry is essential as we work to build a strong and sustainable economy through increased diversification.‚Äù

SB 943 ensures North Carolina remains a strong competitor for film production dollars, which totaled $91 million in direct spending in 2008.† The industry employs more than 2,500 statewide.† Recent major motion pictures filmed in the state include ‚ÄúNights in Rodanthe,‚Äù ‚ÄúLeatherheads‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Secret Life of Bees.‚Äù† The N.C. film industry is also home to the CW Network‚Äôs ‚ÄúOne Tree Hill‚Äù TV series as well as hundreds of commercial and industrial productions each year throughout the state.

More than 800 movies have been filmed in North Carolina.† The state is well known for supporting its motion picture industry with a strong infrastructure and a bevy of locations that can stand in for sites throughout the world.† North Carolina boasts an exceptional variety of filming locations from the mountains to the coast, and a world-class film industry infrastructure. Wilmington‚Äôs EUE Screen Gems, home of the largest studio lot east of California, recently opened the largest film and television production soundstage on the East Coast.

Gov. Perdue Announces 45 New Jobs at Sara Lee

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Wedneday announced that Sara Lee will be creating 45 new jobs at their factory in Tarboro. The new jobs come from an $11 million capital investment by Sara Lee for the addition of an equipment line to make biscuits.

‚ÄúSara Lee‚Äôs $11 million investment in North Carolina is a testament to our state‚Äôs top-rated business climate,‚Äù said Perdue. ‚ÄúAnd because of our strong and talented workforce Sara Lee will continue to expand its operations here.‚Äù

Sara Lee currently employees 808 people at its Tarboro factory. The Tarboro facility was just awarded ‚ÄúPlant of the Year‚Äù by Sara Lee. The biscuit production will add five million lbs to the 97 million lbs of food product the facility turns out every year.

Ms. McKinley:



Your e-mail has been forwarded to the NC Department of Correction for response.



To answer your questions: No new laws were passed allowing for first time non-violent offenders to receive parole or early release.† Yes, we are closing prisons. The total scheduled for closing is seven (7) but this will not result in the release of first time offenders.



If you have other questions about the NC Department of Correction you may call me toll-free at 1-800-368-1985.


Sincerely,

Seagrove, NC 27341-9098 September 3, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing on behalf of farm workers like Salvador Solis who are fighting for their right to be treated just like workers in every other industry. He says, "We are made of flesh and blood, just like everyone else. We work hard. We have families. We have dreams of a better future. We deserve to have a day of rest, to be paid overtime and to join a union if we choose just like everyone else." Under current law, farm workers are denied: * Overtime pay provisions of Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). * The minimum wage provisions of the FLSA (on farms that employ fewer than seven workers). * The child labor protections of the FLSA. The law's protections against the hazards of students working in shopping malls are stronger than the protections against children working in agriculture where toxic pesticides, heavy machinery and other hazards threaten their future. * The right to join labor unions and bargain collectively. Please do your best to right this wrong by supporting legislation that would remove exemptions for agriculture from the labor laws. Sincerely, Laurie Abela 336 8786579

Dear Ms. Warren:

Your e-mail has been referred to the NC Department of Correction for response. You state your frustration with sex offenders being released from prison.

Any change to North Carolina laws would require action by the North Carolina legislature. If you have not already done so, please contact your state legislators to make them aware of your concerns.†You can reach them at <http://www.ncleg.net/>www.ncleg.net or by calling 919-733-4111.†



Thank you for taking the time to share your concerns.

Subject: sex offenders

Comment: I am writing to express my frustration with sex offenders being released from prison. This case in the news now with this man Garrido who had served 11 years of a 50 year sentence after he had kidnapped and raped a woman, and now it seems he had kept this girl captive for some eighteen years, it should never have happened. Sex offenders are among the most likely to repeat offend. We need sentencing that is strict and does not allow early release. And why is rape not a life sentence?? It is time to take a look at who is in our jails. We have drug offenders who serve longer than sex offenders and that is crazy. Who would you rather have living next to you a former dope dealer or a former rapist? That's what I thought.

Your e-mail was forwarded to the North Carolina Department of Correction. You are writing in support of keeping Guilford Correctional Center open.

This year's budget passed and†included the closure of Guilford Correctional Center. There is nothing the NC Department of Correction can do to reverse this decision.

Your support and ministry to those incarcerated is appreciated.

Comment: I read in the local paper that the McLeansville Correctional Facility will be closing in October 2009. I implore you to reconsider this action. Our church is one of several who have a ministry there monthly. Men are coming to know the Lord and turning their lives around, for the better. Instead of closing this prison, why not find one that has no ministries there and transfer those inmates to the Mcleansville unit. I urge you to please reconsider this action. Thanks for listening.

Green The Block is proud to stand in solidarity with the President and United We Serve. We call upon you to participate in the 9.11.09 Green The Block National Service Day. I Have already registered Raleigh for the event I need City help to launch it. I would like to use Moore Square for the event.

If I ultiately fail to have this resolved, is there a place I can complain and feel reasonably assured that some action might be taken? I will not name the surveyor until all reasonable recourse has been exhausted. John Baldwin

Dear Ms. Gerbino,



The Governorís Office has received your letter and has asked the Department of Commerce to respond. I am pleased to do so. †Unfortunately, state government does not have grant funds to start a new business. The state does invest in information services for entrepreneurs like you. I will send you via snail mail, the brochures that the DOC has developed in partnership with the NC Rural Center. These pamphlets outline the resources available.



Sincerely,

Gail McDonald

Subject: Fiber to the Home (Affordable High Speed Internet)

Comment: Governor Bev Perdue I have a passion to build the most cost effective Fiber to the Home (FTTH) telecommunications system possible. Sept. 1, 2007, my wife and I purchased our 1st and only cable system in Snow Hill NC. I want to inform you of this great opportunity to fulfill my dream while providing a much needed and requested service. I did not purchase this system for grant money, but with the grants available I can acheive my goals much sooner while keeping cost at a great price, creating jobs, etc. I plan to use the Commscope (a NC company located in Hickory NC) Bright Path Fiber to the Home Product. Please review the following reasons this can be accomplished: 1. Over 30 years of experience (eliminates expensive consultants) 2. 100% husband and wife owned (no investors) 3. Personally Debt Free (Only debt is this cable system which was purshases below market value) 4. Member of the National Cable Telecommunication Cooperative (Volume discounts for over 90% of the programming, materials, vehicles, etc.) 5. I currently offer free video services to schools, fire departments, municiple buildings, senoir citizens buildings, libraries, etc., and I want to include fiber connectivity for high speed broadband internet and telephone. Please call me at Cell: 606.307.3163 Sincerly, Dale Hancock Media Cast 1121 SE 2nd Street Snow Hill NC 28580

Subject: goverment bail out is a hold out!

Comment: Dear Governor, I work at the "chalotte auto collection" a high end first class automoble dealer at 5809 East INdependence Blvd. This Russian gentleman came to this country with nothing and has built a great place to work. He has approx 6 million dollars in property here and has 50% equity in the property. He wants to borrow more cash so we can buy more cars to sell but no bank is willing to loan any of the goverment stimilus money to help us grow. I thought that that was what it was for. I'm a disabled vet that loves to work her for this honorable man. How about calling him and helping us grow our business via the goverment bail out money? I'm very serious about this Governor. As a disabled vet I am asking you to come meet with him and talk about this. His name is Nicolai Stepanov. His email address is nick.s@charlotteautocollection.com Please contact him to set up a meeting here. This is very important to keeping people employed here. Thank you

Hereís an answer from OSBM.† It will need to be tweakedÖ.









Unfortunately, there is not a single source that addresses Ms. Jackson's question regarding grants administered by state agencies. Federal grants are, of course, announced on grants.gov. Under Executive Order 4, the requirement for NCOpenBook is to report on grant and contract awards, rather than announcing grant opportunities.



I agree with Ms. Jackson that a single source of state grant opportunities would be an excellent value-added service. However, this new feature would require additional data collection from the agencies and a different Web presentation. I will take this suggestion under consideration as we move ahead with NCOpenBook improvements.



One other idea: The Foundation Center provides some grant resources on their Web site:† <http://foundationcenter.org>http://foundationcenter.org

But it is likely that Ms. Jackson is already familiar with this resource.

Thank you for responding.† I am† interested in open grants for a library, consumer credit counseling service, a classic car museum and a 4-H Agency, I have worked on several different ones for non-profits.



The Open Book lists many grants which are no longer open.† And to determine if they are current grants I could contact a non-profit about, each and every grant must be opened up to review the date.



By changing the Open Book Grants info to two categories - one listing recent grants closed, and one listing open grants, would be very helful.†



Thanks again for responding.† Patricia Jackson

Subject: A Soldiers Question

To whom it may concern:

Good afternoon, my name is PFC Joshua F. Waters and I am proudly serving
in the North Carolina National Guard. My unit is currently deployed to
Iraq and are actively supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom. I write you
because I have a concern with my Brigade. Apparently, my Brigade has
deemed that only field grade officers and soldiers that have conducted
an act of Valor are the only ones eligible for a Meritorious Service
Medal or a Bronze Star. I, among others, feel that this is unfair to the
enlisted and Non-Commissioned Officers that are the "Back-Bone" of the
United States Army. There are numerous instances where myself and NCO's
have completed tasks and missions that require us to go way beyond the
call of duty and we have succeeded in doing so with efficiency, honor,
and integrity. 

We serve our country proudly and we do it not for a medal or
recognition, but because it is what is asked of us. However, The United
States Army does offer medals that are for soldiers that were not able
to earn them in combat, but still had missions as equally important to
support the soldiers that were in combat. I would like to know why my
Brigade will only allow officers to receive medals. 

My NCO and myself have single-handedly ordered, organized, and
distributed medical supplies for more than 5,000 soldiers since we
arrived here in May and will continue to due so until we leave. The
5,000 includes our Brigade as well as many other units. This task is
normally performed by 6-8 soldiers, but due to our situation, we have
had to make due with two and we are currently performing more
efficiently and quickly than the units we have replaced. 

I would also like to know what the State of North Carolina has planned
for our return ceremony. Before we left, we had the unfortunate event of
not having enough room in the Coliseum in Fort Bragg. Several hundred
people, including my mother and sister, were not able to get inside due
to the fact the Coliseum had reached it's max capacity. Once again, I do
not believe I am the only one with this concern and would like to know
what, if any, actions will be taken to prevent the same thing happening
when we return.

If there is anything that you know or can tell me that is useful in
helping find an answer other than, "That's the way it is," I would very
much appreciate it.

Visitor: Mr. Steven Ferguson

Address: 70 Alcock Lane, Youngsville, NC 27596

Email: iraqiskleeve@yahoo.com

Subject: 30th Brigade Soldier Seeks Governors Help

Comment: Thank you for taking the time to read this. My name is Sergeant Steven Ferguson. I am currently deployed with the 30th Brigade in Southern Baghdad, Iraq. I am in the 230th Brigade Support Battalion, but currently working in the Convoy Security Company, also in the 230th. During the mobilization process to come to Iraq, my Brigade went to the National Training Center, just outside Barstow, CA. After arriving there, I received the word from my mother, that my wife, of 9 months, was in labor pains and was heading to UNC hospital. I booked and paid for a flight on March 12, 2009. My commander instructed me that the Army had a paternity regulation, that allowed Active Army soldiers 10 non-chargable days of leave to be with their spouse. Under that regulation, I received 10 days of leave, and luckily made it back to NC to see my first daughter be born on March 13th of this year. I would also like to mention, that I am a soldier that is under the Stop-Loss policy. I completed my military contract on Dec 19th, 2008. I was ordered to deploy however, and have served 8 months of Active service over my military contract. Once arriving in Iraq in early May 2009, I was told that I would not get my 14 days of leave to go home, because I had taken 10 days in March for the birth of my daughter. My First Sergeant has tried multiple times to get an answer on why this is, but has no success as of today. He went as far as to file an IG complaint for this very reason, only to be told to stand down. I have come to learn that the IG component on my location, is also under investigation from Division, because of the denial of complaints for leave. This has led me to you, and I consider this my last option. I have served proudly in Iraq once prior to this deployment. I have never seen such poor leadership in command in my entire 7 year military experience. The Farewell Ceremony was only the beginning for us. Other soldiers that received Emergency leave just as I did, such as my current Battalion Sergeant Major, have been told they will allow them to take their leave. I find this very unfair and have no outlet to turn to for help but to you. I informed my 1SG that would email and contact you, and he agreed with me 100%. I am an American soldier, and can honestly deal with unfairness in this unit, as I have before. However, this is affecting my family as well as myself. I would appreciate any response you may give, and hope you will help in any way. Thank you for your time. SGT Steven Ferguson

Email: chip_scm@hotmail.com

Subject: Revolutionary, Buyoant, Emergency evacuation Device

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, With a personal invitation from Kentucky's Governor Beshear, Evacucorp, Inc. introduced our patent pending, rapidly inflatable, "Evacupod" emergency evacuation device to the Kentucky Emergency Management community last week. The "Evacupod" was received with tremendous interest and was said to "Revolutionize emergency evacuations worldwide." The "Evacupod", differentiates itself from the "Evacusled", and "MedSled" devices which are currently being utilized within Hospitals, Fire, EMS, and emergency response units in your state, by being rapidly inflatable, mountable anywhere (walls, stairwells, closets, and on any vehicle, boat, or aircraft,) and most importantly, it is buoyant. Not to take away from the "Evacusled" and "MedSled's" ability to evacuate an incapacitated person or patient during a fire or disaster, but these products fall short in a flooding or hurricane scenario, which are real possibilities in your state. The "Evacupod" is the only buoyant evacuation system on the market. I am aware that until now, the only option for Hospitals, Fire, EMS, and emergency response units within your state have been the products currently on the market, and that most are currently equipped with these devices through state and federal grants, along with other private capital. Although prior purchases have been made by the afore mentioned entities within your state, the "Evacupod's" ability to not only evacuate, but literally float a person for extended periods of time when needed, warrants the addition of the "Evacupod" to these entities. For more information concerning the "Evacupod", please refer to our website, www.evacupod.com. A PDF brochure is downlodable on the website as well. Please let me know if we can arrange a personal demonstration for your emergency management staff. Thank you for your interest and response. Regards, Chip Connor Owner / Partner Evacucorp, Inc. 502-876-1439 Cell

Dearest officials



I have served in Lee County as an employer, school founder and†member of Workforce Development Board.†

As† a part of the Sanford community I have been involved with the Gorham family and the Abundant Life Church where William Earl Gorham†served as Pastor after having served time in the penal system.†



As an owner of a Family Care Home we felt that he had exemplified the kind of reform that is hoped for in people returning from the penal system and offered to allow him lodging in the home while offering security for our residence facility at night.† My requirements were among other things a random drug search, three letters of reference, high school diploma and nothing of child or adult abuse on†record. The reference had to come from community leaders who would recommend him and his probation officer.†† All were agreeable except the probation officer was on leave not to return until the following week.†† I spoke with Art Reid and† Randy Sawyer of the Lee county probation office who assured me that†Pastor Gorham was a good pick and that he would not do anything harmful to the residents but I needed to wait to get the letter from his probabtion officer.† They assured me that he would be recommended and that he would be coming to be with us.



I have since been informed that he has been listed as an "absconder" and is in violation of parole for a traffic ticket violation.† Please investigate the reasoning for this.†



Pastor Gorham voluntarily submitted to a randon drug search for me (Negative) and has produced recommendations from viable citizens of our community recommending him for the resident security.

Subject: Certificate of Completion and Restoration of Rights

Comment: I am in the process of trying to get a copy of my Certificate of Completion of Probation and Restoration of Rights. I believe this was given to me once I completed probation but over the years I misplaced it. I find now that I really need it for my job among other factors such as registering to vote, ect. I am enclosing the information I think you will need for locating the record. I looked on line and saw that it should be on file in Robeson County, which was the county of the offense. I called them and was told that they don‚Äôt have it and it should be in Brunswick County which is the county where I finished probation. When I contacted them I was told that it was in Raleigh, N.C. They also told me that they would need to get that for me though that I could not contact Raleigh and get it myself. I have made numerous calls to Brunswick County Probation Office. I spoke several times to a lady named Teal (1st Name), don‚Äôt know last name. She has been very polite and nice, as helpful as she can possibly be but has told me that she has given notes, numbers, name, ect to her Captain. She said the Captain is the person that will need to get this information from Raleigh for me. She gave all the information to Jackie Ward, Captain and asked her to contact me. This was last week. This is the 3rd week I have been communicating with Teal. As of today, July 21, 2009 I have not heard back from Ms. Ward and I left her another message on July 13th and 15th. I don‚Äôt want to be a pest but, I really need this information. I am not sure if you are the right person to help me but, I decided since I haven‚Äôt received a response after almost 4 weeks from Brunswick County that maybe I should start searching for this information someplace else. On Friday, July 17, I was told that possibly Carrie Dennis and or Michael Unruh could help me in the archive department and was given their emails. On July 17th I made calls but they were out of the office. On July 20th I sent emails to them both and haven't received a response back. I sent this early in the morning on the 20th. As you can see I work now as a Legal Assistant for a firm in Virginia. My employer knows of my background and needs this certificate for part of my work. Also, I need it for my ability to vote ect. I don't understand why it has been so difficult to get someone to help me locate a copy of the certificate or why it has been so difficult to get someone to give me an answer as to where I can get it or who to contact. This is why I have decided to contact you. I have worked very hard over the past years to make a life for myself and my daughter, obtain good employment, and overall work at being a good citizen. Please do what you can to help direct me to the right person to help me with this issue. I live in Virginia, it would be a drive for me to come to North Carolina to get it but if that is what it takes I will do that. I am certainly willing to do whatever it takes to get this information as soon as possible. You can contact me at work at 804-328-6988 Monday thru Thursday or my cell is 540-797-1292. As you can see, I have been working on this for going on 4 weeks and haven't received any real help yet from any of the sources I have been directed to. Please do whatever you can do to help me with this. Name at time of conviction was Beverly Denise Teal- Date of Conviction- 1-11-1993. DOB- 02-17-1958 DOC # 0401979 Docke# 92002419 Offense Date- 07/19/1991 Sentence- Type 1- Probation Sentence- Type 2- Suspended Sentence My address is 4173 Virginia Rail Drive, Providence Forge, VA 23140.

Comment: I am writing to voice my vote on subsidizing the folks on the coast. I don't believe we should be asked to cover their expenses, which places an undue burden on my household. Now is the worst times to be adding any new fees. I am borderline losing my home due to rising medical expenses right now. Now is not the time to ask for more, but to do with less, as i have been doing for the past nine years. Thank You for your time. Respectively, Ralph Green.

Visitor: Mr. Chip Connor

Email: chip_scm@hotmail.com

Subject: Revolutionary, Buyoant, Emergency evacuation Device

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, With a personal invitation from Kentucky's Governor Beshear, Evacucorp, Inc. introduced our patent pending, rapidly inflatable, "Evacupod" emergency evacuation device to the Kentucky Emergency Management community last week. The "Evacupod" was received with tremendous interest and was said to "Revolutionize emergency evacuations worldwide." The "Evacupod", differentiates itself from the "Evacusled", and "MedSled" devices which are currently being utilized within Hospitals, Fire, EMS, and emergency response units in your state, by being rapidly inflatable, mountable anywhere (walls, stairwells, closets, and on any vehicle, boat, or aircraft,) and most importantly, it is buoyant. Not to take away from the "Evacusled" and "MedSled's" ability to evacuate an incapacitated person or patient during a fire or disaster, but these products fall short in a flooding or hurricane scenario, which are real possibilities in your state. The "Evacupod" is the only buoyant evacuation system on the market. I am aware that until now, the only option for Hospitals, Fire, EMS, and emergency response units within your state have been the products currently on the market, and that most are currently equipped with these devices through state and federal grants, along with other private capital. Although prior purchases have been made by the afore mentioned entities within your state, the "Evacupod's" ability to not only evacuate, but literally float a person for extended periods of time when needed, warrants the addition of the "Evacupod" to these entities. For more information concerning the "Evacupod", please refer to our website, www.evacupod.com. A PDF brochure is downlodable on the website as well. Please let me know if we can arrange a personal demonstration for your emergency management staff. Thank you for your interest and response. Regards, Chip Connor Owner / Partner Evacucorp, Inc. 502-876-1439 Cell

National Health Policy Experts Lead Plenary Discussions at NASHP Conference

As Washington debates health reform, states are coping with tough economic times.† At the plenaries, national experts will give their insight about health reform challenges in the states.

A State Policymaker's Guide to Health Reform
Alan Weil, Executive Director, National Academy for State Health Policy, will lead this plenary session and focus on the many ways states can expect to be affected by health reform and offer guidance on how to prepare for the changes to come.

Swimming in Red Ink:† Health Care in Terrible Budget Times
Almost every state is confronted with fiscal challenges on a scale never before experienced. Tight budgets present policymakers with tough choices and the opportunity to ask fundamental questions regarding priorities and the role of government.† Hear how four leaders are navigating their states through terrible budget times.† The panel includes:

* S. Kimbery BelshÈ, Secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency
* Melvin Neufeld, Kansas State Representative
* Janet Olszewski, Director of the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH)
* Trish Riley, Director, Governor's Office of Health Policy and Finance, State of Maine (Moderator)
The Innovator's Prescription:† How Disruptive Innovation Can Fix Health Care
Jason Hwang, MD, MBA, Executive Director of Healthcare, Innosight Institute, will discuss how disruptive innovation and the lessons of innovation from other industries can be applied to health care.† Dr. Hwang will analyze the business models of the physician's practice and newer retail clinics, while taking a close look at the unstable business model of today's general hospital.† Furthermore, Dr. Hwang will discuss how we can establish a new value network in health care to disrupt the existing one-and who can lead the charge.†

A View of Health Reform from California
California recently went through a contentious-and ultimately unsuccessful-effort to provide health insurance to everyone.† As the largest state, the potential effects of national health reform will be felt acutely in California.† Learn about California's experience from Richard Figueroa, Deputy Cabinet Secretary, Office of the Governor, State of California.


Preconference Sessions Will Highlight Payment Reform, Health Information Technology, Eligible Populations and Long Term Services and Supports
The preconference sessions at the NASHP conference will focus on critical issues with in-depth presentations and discussions from national health policy experts.

IBM System zÆ Software Webcast

Achieve rapid ROI with new workloads on System z

Creating new services quickly and flexibly is a goal every business can understand, and if it can be done by reusing existing applications and data, you‚Äôre that much further ahead. However, rewriting applications can be expensive, time consuming and risky, with no guarantee that they are any better. And replacing them with packaged solutions can also be problematic because you risk losing the intellectual capital that‚Äôs buried deep in your systems.

Join us for this complimentary webcast and learn how modernization can make your business more responsive, and make applications more flexible, reusable and easy to maintain. Repurposing or modernizing existing mainframe applications is both a financially sound and a time-tested approach to modifying existing assets so they can be included as part of a service oriented architecture (SOA). In this webcast, we‚Äôll share details about what you can gain from modernizing applications, some WebSphereÆ and RationalÆ tools that can help, and why the System zÆ platform is an important component of modernization projects.

Topics include:

* Lowering price performance by co-locating application logic and data subsystems without sacrificing
the operational benefits of System z
* Eliminating skills silos to create a unified pool of business-oriented developers who can be deployed according to business demands
* Running OLTP and batch applications concurrently without affecting service level agreements for OLTP transactions on shared hardware
