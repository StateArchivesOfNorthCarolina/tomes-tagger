Dear Governer Perdue,
I'm writing to ask you and your administration to support efforts in the Legislature to slow down the fast track rush to impose a new coal burning cement plant and adjacent open pit limestone quarry on New Hanover County.  At the very least I ask you to not oppose such efforts.
The Carolinas Cement Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Titan America, LLC, itself a subsidiary of the Titan Cement Company of Greece, has lately been flooding Raleigh with a mix of half truths and whole dollars in their efforts to have this project put on the fast track with minimal environmental oversight or regulation.  The scale of the proposed project, the very nature of the industry, and the location of the planned plants and quarries should all demand stricter regulatory oversight, not expedited approval.  At the very least the project needs to be considered as a whole at each stage of the permitting process.  Air permits should not be issued for construction of the plant without considering the associated mining operations and no permits should be issued before the full Environmental Impact Statement is released.
That there are no cement plants operating in North Carolina further raises the question as to our capacity to competently evaluate and regulate this industry at all.  I'm very worried that applying standards developed for small scale gravel operations or manufacturing facilities to such a large operation may be inadequate.  Sen. Boseman's proposal for a temporary moratorium on new Cement Plant construction until such issues can be addressed (S699) seems eminently reasonable.
I have heard it proposed that the State of North Carolina invited Titan Cement to build this plant and that imposing oversight would be taken as rude and unfriendly to business.  This is simply untrue.  The facts of the matter are that Titan America (and its predecessors and sudsidiaries) first purchased the property in question some 25 years ago, promising, at the time, to build a state of the art $75 million cement kiln.  That didn't happen.  They later announced plans once again build a new plant for the site (this time throwing around numbers in the $200 million range) but, once again, nothing happened.  The sad fact is that Castle Hayne, NC is not a particularly good place to locate a cement plant.  The layers of limestone needed to feed a cement kiln are all located well below the local water table.  The workforce is there, the transportation links are there, and the land is there, but the topography and geologoy of the Atlantic Coastal Plain with its swamps, wetlands, rivers and lack of elevation all make responsible mining operations prohibitively expensive.  (Irresponsible mining operations can still be cost effective, but that's the whole worry here.)
After 25 years of start and stop plans from Titan, will a one year moratorium really be that much of a hardship?  After a quarter century of planning and replanning, why is it now imperative to build a new plant on a crash basis?  At one point Titan shelved its construction plans simply because it was more profitable to rent out the exisiting facilities on that property as a movie set.  If you wonder what the inside of a cement plant looks like I direct your attention to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies where the old plant served as the headquarters of "The Foot", the enemies of the heroes on the half shell.  I'm sure any further similarity between Titan Cement and an evil ninja clan behind a massive urban crime wave are purely coincidental.
Titan's PR machine has been hyping jobs as the #1 advantage of this new plant.  Again, the truth is less clear.  Cement is a very cyclical industry.  When times are good, cement is in demand and plants operate at capacity. When times are not good cement is not in demand and plants shut down for months at a time.  Long term, TItan promises jobs only when we don't need them.  Titan gets more support from its short term claims: the number of jobs it will bring to the area for plant construction.  Here there is some very short term truth: there will be construction jobs and construction jobs drive the economy of Southeastern North Carolina.  But consider also that Titan is building this plant in the northern part of the county.  New Hanover County is a fairly small (geographically) county and largely built up.  Our beach towns are built up.  Our urban areas are built up.  The region experiencing the most growth the past few years (and projected to continue that way for the forseeable future) is northern part of the county.  But putting a giant open pit mine and cement kiln will effectively end residential and commercial development in that part of the county.  Holly Shelter Road will cease to be the new focus of housing development and become a designated heavy industrial blight area, much like US421 to the NW of Wilmington is now.  We do NOT need another stretch of 421.  The building industry in this area is  in good position to rebound and get back to building houses - but not if we poison their fields like this.
I was particularly distressed some months ago to see the Commerce Department lined up to oppose Boseman's S699 and later to oppose Sen. Justice's motion to bring such plants under SEPA.  This disappointed me on two levels.  First, it absolutely flew in the face of the talk of "green jobs" and "green industry" we've been hearing from your administration and especially from your Commerce Department and its NC Economic Development Committee.  Talking about green jobs while at the same time greasing the skids for a particularly dirty industry in a particularly sensitive region was the kind of hypocrisy nobody wants to see from a new administration. 
Secondly, I view this as a largely local issue.  The local delegation to Raleigh has been united in their wishes to see things slowed down and thought out.  Titan does not have broad local support.  What local support they have is small and uncommitted.  It's now widely acknowledged that the County Commissioners erred when they extended an incentive package to Titan, relying on the kind of strict regulation and oversight that Titan now seems to be avoiding.  Titan is a decidedly unpopular player in this county and we wonder why the powers that be in Raleigh seem determined to force it down our throats?  From a purely political standpoint, I believe supporting this project is a mistake.
I close with the example of the Elgin Marbles.  In early 19th century Athens the lime and cement industry did not necessarily quarry for raw limestone to fuel their kilns.  They used whatever limestone or marble was to be found at hand.  There was quite a bit of limestone and marble lying about on the Acropolis: the old, abandoned greek temples.  Fallen pieces and other pieces easily removed (sculptures, friezes, pediments, columns, etc.) were carted off and burned down to lime and cement.  Between1801 and 1813 Lord Elgin, then British Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, purchased, removed and shipped overseas much of the most precious statuary and friezes from the Acropolis.  These masterpieces of antiquity were later acquired by the British Museum where they were preserved and displayed for hundreds of years until, fairly recently, the Greek government began agitating for their return.  Where they should be displayed today is an issue for artists and international lawyers, but it is widely accepted that had Lord Elgin not removed the marble pieces they likely would have gone into an Athenian limeburners kiln and ended up as stucco for some 19th century mixed use development. 
The Northeast Cape Fear River and Island Creek (the beautiful and rich area where Titan wants to build and strip mine) and the aquifer beneath (which Titan wants to lower by a hundred feet or more to access the limestone) are our Elgin Marbles, our natural treasures, our birthright.  We have no imperialist British ambassador with paternal instincts to ship the river off for safekeeping until we come to our senses.  We don't even have a foursome of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ready to crawl out of the sewers to save us from the evil Foot.  We don't need them.  We do have a basic framework of environmental protection in place.  We can expand on what we have and enforce the finished product and protect ourselves, but we can't do that if Raleigh lacks the political will to stand up to the limeburners and others who would ignore what protections are already in place.
Please, Governor.  Let the system work.  There ought be no rush to strip mine Island Creek or drain our fresh water aquifer.  If the plan is a good one, it will still be a good one a year from now.  This proposed plant will be here for 100 years.  Let's take the time to get it right.
Sincerely,
William Vinal

This e-mail is more about the Titan plant in Wilmington and less about education.  The lady only refers to education because the plant is near her children’s school.

Subject: Protect the health & safety of school children in New Hanover County

Comment: I am completely sickened by the fact the North Carolina is refusing to step up and make Titan go through the SEPA process. My children have been districted to attend a brand new middle school that will be 1.5 miles from the Titan smoke stack. Titan will emit 340 tons annually of particulate matter - the equivalent of 24.8 billion cigarettes directly over and elementary and middle school, along with known carcinogens and neurotoxins. As a person who is living with Multiple Sclerosis, which may have an environmental component, I am accutely aware of the hazards of letting my child attend school there. Would you live under a smokestack? I wouldn't, and I can not have my child attend a school under one. North Carolina is failing the school children of New Hanover County. This is a serious matter and the residents here are not being heard only Titan's lobbiest are being heard. Please do something! I do not want to get the diagnoses in a few years that my child has cancer or some other illness. I would never have moved to such a beautiful coastal region if I ever had an idea that North Carolina is okay with destroying it (along with the health of growing children). Don't fail us, Catherine Thomas, mother of two children, 8 & 12

The legislation contains a provision that allows states to opt out of the federal licensing program, and the choice for our state to stay in or opt out will come shortly after implementation of the legislation. As a constituent, voter, and proud poker player, I ask that you support keeping our state in this important program. U.S. House Bill H.R. 2267 and U.S. Senate Bill S. 1597 provide for sensible licensing, regulation, and taxation of Internet poker. They mandate rigorous, verifiable safeguards against underage participation while providing consumer protections for the millions, including many in our state, who play online poker every day. These bills also include dedicated funding to establish and implement programs for prevention and treatment of those with excessive gaming habits. Both bills benefit our state economically. According to an economic study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers in April, tax revenues from these bills will provide billions of dollars to the U.S. Treasury and to the states in the program. Additionally, the Senate bill provides for revenue-sharing with participating states, bringing even more much-needed funds into our state's coffers. Both bills allow American companies to participate in the world's Internet poker market, bringing needed jobs to our state as well. Solutions like H.R. 2267 and S. 1597 provide the most rational approach to controlling this industry and preserving it for adults who choose to engage in games of skill like poker. An unenforceable, unpopular prohibition provides none of these benefits. All prohibition can do is drive players underground or overseas while limiting my personal freedom. What's most important to me is your support for my rights. Please respond to this letter and let me know if you will support keeping our state in this important program.

Subject: Titan cement plant

Comment: I am not in favor of Titan Cement receiving permission to reopen an idle cement plant located on the Cape Fear River just upstream of Wilmington. I consider this to be an extremely polluting industry which seems well enough supplied by other cement plants in our vicinity. To me, the economic benefits of reopening this plant would be greatly outweighed by the environmental damage. Count me strongly against this project, but I'm interested in the governor's stand on this issue.

Subject: STOP TItan

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue, Please help us stop the Titan Plant from coming to Wilmington. There is no good that can come from trading the health of our community, especially the children that will be going to school near the plant for 49 new jobs. Titan will ruin our city's tourism industry. It will reduce our property values. I am a New Hanover county voter and I am asking you to put an end to the possibility of Titan. Respectfully submitted, Pierrette Cortner

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing as a concerned citizen regarding the Titan Cement Plant.  My family and I live in Wilmington, NC and have followed this project and educated ourselves on the impacts of this devastating project that will have widespread effects on our quality of life.  The heavy pollution and contamination of our air and water quality in Wilmington will be unacceptable and unlivable if this plant is not stopped and allowed to come.  We have three young children ages 10, 8, and 4, and are highly concerned for our family's future health.  One of our children already has severe allergies and asthma.  This plant will be one of the largest sources of air pollution in our area.   New Hanover County already has some of the highest toxic emissions in North Carolina.  


We do not want Titan in our community.  The environmental destruction, pollution of our air and water, and health risks violate the protective provisions of the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act.  Titan should be held to the SEPA and EPA laws.  We have the right to breathe clean air and water, and not have our basic human rights taken away from us.  The proposed Titan plant is just 6 miles from our home.  Our oldest son has also just been redistricted to attend school one mile from the plant next year.  8,700 school children will attend schools within close proximity.  This plant so close to our home and community is unacceptable, and we strongly urge you to stand up against this project.  Our communities precious resources and the health of its citizens should not be sold out for cheap cement.  Eighty percent of cement plants have had violations over the last five years.  Titan cement has had numerous violations at their plants in Virginia and Florida.  The impacts of this plant are unacceptable, and we do not want to have to leave the area.  My husband owns a business here that would also make it very difficult for us to leave the area as well.  This is our home where we work, live, attend church, and live close by to family. Please stand up and do everything you can to protect your citizens and our community.  Our beautiful coastal city and the health of its citizens is counting on you.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Nicole Rollins

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am a resident of North Carolina and wish to express my support for the proposed Carolinas Cement plant to be built in Castle Hayne, N.C. I supported the issuance of the Draft Air Permit to Carolinas Cement and I support the issuance of the official Air Permit without delay.

A cement plant in North Carolina will have positive effects in our community in a number of ways, such as mitigating the potential shortage of this strategic material and controlling competition for foreign imports (e.g., Venezuela, Columbia and China). Greater choice of supply will impact cost on every building project, major sewer system or large scale highway project in the state, making scarce state and county funds go further while shrinking the carbon footprint associated with importing cement from overseas.

I have done my research an! d I know Carolinas Cement and its parent company, Titan America LLC, to be organizations of great integrity with an excellent reputation for community involvement and environmental stewardship. I trust that current federal and state regulations will protect our health and safety. We, in North Carolina, are in desperate need of the jobs, revenue and taxes this project will generate. Additional information about the project is available at www.carolinascement.com.

I urge you to support Carolinas Cement and the issuance of the Air Permit without delay.

Sincerely,
Benjamin Schmitt

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am a resident of North Carolina and wish to express my support for the proposed Carolinas Cement plant to be built in Castle Hayne, N.C. I supported the issuance of the Draft Air Permit to Carolinas Cement and I support the issuance of the official Air Permit without delay.

A cement plant in North Carolina will have positive effects in our community in a number of ways, such as mitigating the potential shortage of this strategic material and controlling competition for foreign imports (e.g., Venezuela, Columbia and China). Greater choice of supply will impact cost on every building project, major sewer system or large scale highway project in the state, making scarce state and county funds go further while shrinking the carbon footprint associated with importing cement from overseas.

I have done my research and I know Carolinas Cem! ent and its parent company, Titan America LLC, to be organizations of great integrity with an excellent reputation for community involvement and environmental stewardship. I trust that current federal and state regulations will protect our health and safety. We, in North Carolina, are in desperate need of the jobs, revenue and taxes this project will generate. Additional information about the project is available at www.carolinascement.com.

I urge you to support Carolinas Cement and the issuance of the Air Permit without delay.

Sincerely,
Maria Koch

Thanks,
I know Titan Cement is a big company but that does not mean they will be good for the State of NC.  I hope we can work together to make sure they do not locate in our great state.
Thanks again,
Dave

Thank you for submitting your comments to Governor Perdue's suggestion box. We appreciate public input and hope you will continue to engage with us.

Dear Governor Perdue,



I know that you are familiar with the highly controversial Titan Cement project coming to Wilmington, NC. I will not spend time reiterating the devastating facts regarding just what devastation to our air and water quality that this plant will do to our local water and air because I know that you are well familiar with the facts.



I am writing you to urge you to please take a stand on this issue. Even though Titan was lured to come here via the previous administration, that is not enough for you to be exempt from taking a stand and not enabling action to help the citizens of our community. You have a duty to protect our basic human rights to breathe clean air and water. We can not escape the realm of this facility which will be located just six miles from our home. The proposed area for Titan's 4th largest cement plant in the United States is heavily populated, and is its residents have no way to escape the devastating effects of this plant.



I met you once years ago, when you spoke at the GFWC-NC (Greater Federation of Women's Clubs of North Carolina) convention. I know that it is in your realm of power, focus and duty to stand up for the rights and safety of women, children, and families across this state. You have the duty as our Governor to not allow such a facility to destroy our precious resources of southeastern North Carolina, and also be the biggest source of pollution in this area for the next fifty years. Our families future health will be severely compromised from the effects of a plant this size, as well as from the pollution it will be allowed to emit. The citizens of Wilmington will not tolerate this kind of mass pollution to our air and water quality. We are counting on you to stand up and protect us. Please unite with us as we fight to protect our coastal community and our most precious commodity, our children. They are the future of North Carolina.



Thank you.



Sincerely,

Nicole Rollins



Our Family

Governor Purdue,

please read the following by my brother regarding Titan and "suggesting" NC might want to emulate Charleston, SC in their business choices.

Please visit <http://www.wilmingtonchamber.org>www.wilmingtonchamber.org where Tom Looney outlines Wilmington 2.0 in the Greater Wilmington Chamber of Commerce magazine "Return on Investment"Sept/Oct 2009 issue

My family would be honored to host a gathering regarding the unique possibilities in Wilmington, rather than the opening of a cement plan

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Subject: Charlestonâ€™s Knowledge Economy in 2009 - The Beacon for Job and Wage Growth
Date: Tue, 20 Oct 2009 23:27:58 -0400


The 10-20-09 news release in the "subject" line (full story below) is rather ironic.

Competing with Wilmington NC for talent/people, companies, and investment dollars (Fed-State-Private), another southeastern coastal port city is making news today about something other than the merits of "economic advancement" by way of a cement company and its promise of a whopping 160 jobs.

All of our local media outlets (TV, talk radio shows, newspapers) are letting the lobbyists from the cement industry frame this debate as "job creation" versus "environmentalists".  I personally think it is something quite different. 

I think the Titan debate (1,500 attendees at today's hearings) pits backwards, tactical economic development (job creation) versus strategic and forward-looking economic development (job creation).  Such as that was delivered via the Chamber-led effort called Cape Fear Future.  And its promising Wilmington 2.0 campaign emphasizing.....drumroll please.....the knowledge economy and creative entrepreneurship as the beacon for smart regional job and wage growth in the 21st century.

By the way, who is in the Coalition for Economic Advancement???  Does it include the Chamber of Commerce?  The University?  Does anyone know if anyone is in this "coalition" other than Titan Cement?

The headlines and "place" identity being engineered by Charleston SC via their Digital Corridor Initiative is what we should be striving for.  They are taunting us with this press release today, with our Titan 24/7 story sucking the oxygen out of our innovation efforts.  They are mocking us for having lost our focus and vision over a darn cement plant.  We could/should be doing better folks.

 Charleston Digital Corridor companies demonstrate resilience amidst general economic weakness

CHARLESTON, SC â€“ October 14, 2009 â€“ The Charleston Digital Corridor reports that the average wages for Digital Corridor companies in 2009 is $83,636. This wage number is once again more than double the average wage levels for the State of South Carolina and the Charleston-North Charleston Statistical Metropolitan Area which are $36,050 and $37,520 respectively, according to the latest (May 2008) Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates provided by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

This yearâ€™s average wage number is slightly higher than the average reported in 2008 and demonstrates the resilience of Charlestonâ€™s growing knowledge economy. â€œBy virtue of the fact that knowledge-based companies are part of the generative economy, they are less susceptible to the economic cycles that characterize other sectors of our economy,â€ said Digital Corridor Director, Ernest Andrade.

In addition to the strong wage numbers posted by Digital Corridor companies, over 50% of the companies have reported staff additions to their payroll with several doubling in size. â€œThe leadership within the Digital Corridor companies, along with continued infrastructure investments being made by the city of Charleston, to grow Charlestonâ€™s knowledge economy are yielding dividends for our community,â€ said Charleston Digital Corridor Foundation Chairman, Kirk King.

Mr. Vandervaart:

I appreciate the time and effort that your division has put into this and all other projects. I realize that as one of the government organizations responsible for protecting North Carolina's Air Quality that your division is very busy.

I am writing this letter as someone that moved to the Wilmington area just over 5 years ago because of its beauty, climate, and recreational opportunities. I am also writing this letter as an expectant parent-to-be. I live approximately 10 miles from the proposed plant. My unborn child will eventually go to the Holly Shelter Middle School that is less than 3 miles from the proposed plant. I am especially concerned with the impact that this plant will have on my child. Has the Division of Air Quality looked at the impact of the proposed plant's emissions on school aged children?

Titan has agreed to comply with the proposed EPA NESHAPS rules. Why does the permit not reflect this? Why is the permit being issued when the proposed rules would better protect my children and community from harmful mercury emissions? I would also like to see Constant Emissions monitors for mercury be required on the plant's kiln. That is a very big concern for those of us with children, expecting children, or that enjoy eating local seafood.

One final concern I have is that I fail to see how the division of air quality can issue this permit without a full review under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA). As a taxpayer, I would like to be assured that any project my tax dollars are supporting has a net positive impact on the community. I fail to see how this project does not require a full review under the SEPA act.

I thank you for your time and have faith that your division will do its best to protect the air quality and health of our region.

Regards,
Adam Shay

Our economy is based on tourism which requires clean air and water to
draw thousands of visitors to our beaches every year.  Why, for so few
jobs, would you compromise that and the health of our citizens.

Please don't allow Titan to build in New Hanover County, NC.

I agree with all the talking points below.


According to the American Lung Association, more than 88,000 residents of New
Hanover County—46% of our population—suffers from health conditions that
will be exacerbated by Titan’s air pollution—including heart disease, asthma,
diabetes, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis. Why has DAQ not completed
a multipathway
health risk assessment on every toxic release from the Titan plant before
granting it a draft permit?

Children are most susceptible to air pollution and Titan’s stack will
be within five
miles of schools housing 8,700 students. Numerous studies have come
out in the last
two years on the harmful effects of air pollution on children. Has DAQ
specifically
looked at the impact of Titan’s emissions on school age children, especially the
elementary students at Castle Hayne Elementary, which is less than 2 miles from
Titan’s site?

Titan will be one of the largest polluters in our region for the next
30 to 50 years
in a county that already has some of the highest toxic emissions in
the state—further
sealing our fate as a heavy industry haven to the detriment of
tourism, fisheries,
retirees, and future high-tech, clean-industries that do not want to
locate near a heavy
polluting cement plant. Our county is already close to non-attainment for ozone
standards. Has DAQ analyzed how close Titan will bring us to non-attainment
standards?

The draft air permit still allows Titan to emit 263 lbs of mercury
even though the
company committed to meeting the much lower draft EPA mercury rule that
was proposed last spring, which included an almost 90% reduction in mercury
emissions to roughly 30 pounds. Titan committed to abiding by the proposed EPA
NESHAPS rules verbally and in writing to DAQ and in meetings with Representative
Carolyn Justice and Representative Danny McComas. This permit should reflect
the proposed rules now or be delayed until the new rules are
finalized. If they can
comply then, why not now? Don’t we deserve cleaner air now?
Titan also promised our elected officials that they would put Constant Emissions
Monitors for mercury on their kiln. Why are CEMS for mercury not included in
the draft air permit? Other cement plants in the nation have
underestimated their
mercury emissions by as much as ten times (estimating 40 pounds, when their
actually emissions were more than 400). CEMs for mercury are currently in use on
other cement plants in the nation. Why not here?

SEPA (State Environmental Policy Act): This is a big project that is
getting more than
$4 million in taxpayer dollars. We deserve to know its impacts. So how can DAQ
issue any permit until the impacts without assessing the cumulative impacts to
our community and ecosystem through the State Environmental Policy Act—our
top environmental law that was specifically designed to evaluate such projects
that receive public money and/or use public lands or waters?
NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act): If the state refuses to do a
review, DAQ
should not bias the federal Environmental Impact Statement being conducted by
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers by approving Titan’s air permit before the EIS
evaluates all reasonable alternatives.

North Carolina in 2002 passed the Clean Smokestacks Act which requires
significant
reduction in pollution from coal-fired power plants. Why is DAQ undermining the
intent and emissions reductions of the Clean Smokestacks by not requiring Titan
—which will burn the same amount of coal as a small power plant and have the
emissions of a medium-sized power plant—to be regulated under the Clean
Smokestacks Act?

Why is DAQ is allowing Titan to emit nearly 700 tons of particulate
matter each year,
including double New Hanover County’s current emissions of PM 2.5 –the most
dangerous type—which can contribute to asthma, heart attacks, strokes,
and sudden
death.

Why does DAQ not look at secondary impacts of the emissions? Secondary impacts
to the ground, vegetation, and water are critical since secondary exposure to
Titan’s pollutants (by eating fish, for example) will increase human exposure to
mercury and other toxic pollutants that could endanger human health as well as
wildlife and fisheries. DAQ is required to consider secondary impacts
yet they have
not considered these impacts in the draft permit.
At a time when the E.P.A. is formulating new regulations to reduce emissions of
CO2, mercury, and other air pollutants from coal-fired industries, why is DAQ
allowing a new industry to burn more than 280,000 tons of coal a year?
Especially when the Sutton Power Plant will no longer be outfitted
with scrubbers as
originally promised? Why is DAQ not requiring Titan to use cleaner
primary fuel for
its kiln, such as natural gas? Why Titan not required to sequester its
CO2 emissions?
How did DAQ model air dispersion and fallout from the Titan plant? How can they
accurately predict where the emissions will fall? Why didn’t they evaluate the
deposition of mercury and other toxins into a river system that is already
mercury impaired?

The permit application states that the emissions from this kiln will
be the result of the
mining operation from the existing quarry that is located on site.
According to Titan,
they plan to mine the entire site, except for the CAMA wetlands and a
1600-acre site
across Holy Shelter Road. How can DAQ issue an air permit when the limestone’s
chemical make-up from other areas is not known? Unless DAQ analyzes all
potential sources of limestone for mercury and other toxins, the draft
permit can not
truthfully evaluate what Titan’s long-term emissions really are.
New Hanover County already has some of the highest emissions of criteria air
pollutants in the state. Why isn’t DAQ working to decrease the amount of air
pollution and toxic emissions in the region instead of rubber stamping a permit
for an industry due to heavy lobbying and political pressure?
Why have DAQ personnel who are actively involved in reviewing this permit
responded to citizen inquiries with statements that blatantly support the Titan
project? (i.e. “We need the jobs.” “We need the cement”—both arguable statements
at best) Their job is to evaluate the air emissions and make an
un-biased decision that
protects public health—not promotes individual industries.
DAQ’s public information officer, Tom Mather, stated in email correspondence
on April 28th that the new EPA regulations would apply to Titan and EPA’s new
mercury and toxic pollutant regulations would be reflected in Titan’s draft
permit. Why then has DAQ approved a draft air permit that is virtually
a carbon copy
of their original air permit application? What happened to the new
regulations DAQ
was going to hold Titan to?

Titan will increase the amount by the following amounts (out of 100%) in New
Hanover County for the following pollutants: (These are just the
highest increases)
Carbon Monoxide 25%
Mercury 115%
Nitrogen Oxide 30%
Lead 25%
Particulate Matter (2.5) 45%
Benzene 76%
Particulate Matter 10 40%
Ammonia 38%
Manganese 143%
POM 247%
Tell DAQ that you want a strategy to clean our air, not increase the
pollution in our
community. EPA defines criteria pollutants as materials that are
responsible for many
adverse effects on human health, causing thousands of cases of
premature mortality
and tens of thousands of emergency room visits per year. These
pollutants also cause
acid rain and can significantly harm the environment and critical
ecosystems in our
region.
Why is DAQ allowing Titan to use fly ash from the Sutton Power plant when the
EPA bans the use of fly ash that increases mercury levels over the
baseline levels
(operating the plant without fly ash)?

With all the meetings and positioning going on from the developers of 
this plant, it comes down to power and money. We, the people, do not 
have lobbies and political leverage like this company has. We rely on 
people like you to defend us. All we can ask is you do what the people 
who will have to live with this are asking. You have the power to do 
what is right. You are our power.
Please help us stop this.

Thank You

> Dear Mr. Vandervaart,
> I was unable to attend the public hearing on 10/20 regarding the proposed Titan Cement plant in Castle Hayne, but felt it important to add my voice to the numerous others in the Cape Fear region who oppose allowing construction of this plant to move forward.  As a resident of Leland in Brunswick County and the father of a small child, I have serious concerns on the effect this plant will have on the people, environment, and economy of this area.

We already have problems with air pollution and mercury in this region.  The last thing we need to do for the people who call this area home is make these problems worse.
> Mr. Vandervaart you are part of the Division of Air Quality.  You are tasked with protecting the air we breathe in our community.  It is a serious responsibility and your decisions will affect every man, woman, child, plant and animal in this region for at least a generation.  You were given this position with the public trust.  I hope you will prove worthy of that trust.

Dear Governor Perdue:
I am writing to you to voice my opinion about the proposal to build the Titan Cement Plant in my town.
I am a single mother and am completely appalled that the big-wigs behind this proposal profess that the plant will be one of the safest cement plants in the U.S.  This plant will emit more toxic emissions into our environment than what they are professing.
Please, as our Governor, put a stop to the building of this plant in our area!!
Thank you!
Your continued supporter,
Kim Kirkland
