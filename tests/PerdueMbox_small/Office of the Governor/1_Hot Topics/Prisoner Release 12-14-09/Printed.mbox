how long has this law on the books and why did it come to this, since you were a former memeber of the General Assembly you should have known about this.

Statement from the Governor Regarding Prisoner Release

Governor Says Offenders Will Not Be Turned Loose



When I learned that the Supreme Court had issued a ruling that meant offenders serving life in prison would be released after a mere 35 years, I was appalled. Like most of my fellow North Carolinians, I believe life should mean life, and even if a life sentence is defined as 80 years, getting out after only 35 is simply unacceptable. 

Since that ruling, my staff and I have been doing everything we can to stop the release of these rapists and murderers. These are people who have been denied parole repeatedly, and many who have numerous infractions during their prison stay. I do not believe they are ready for release onto the streets of our communities. 

While I understand the decision of the Supreme Court, I believe there remain unresolved legal issues that were not addressed. Before Mr. Bowden or any other offender affected by the Court’s decision is turned loose, these issues must be heard. 

At issue is the application of good behavior credits to these violent offenders serving life sentences since the 1970s. Since last week, we have been scrutinizing the good behavior credits applied to the 20 inmates eligible for immediate release. This morning, legal counsel and Department of Correction staff met with officials who oversaw the application of those behavior credits during the 1980s. At the time, the DOC gave inmates day-for-day credits under the authority of the then-secretary. There is a real question whether the General Assembly intended for the DOC to have that kind of authority. I do not believe they did, and my legal counsel agrees. This raises the very real question that these inmates should not be eligible for early release.

 Mr. Bowden’s case is in the process of being sent back to the trial court to recalculate his sentence. These issues can be resolved by the courts.

 Until these new legal issues have been resolved by the courts, Mr. Bowden and the other violent offenders will not be released.

I am really disappointed in your response to this problem. I think you have inflamed an issue which is a legal matter that needs to be addressed with thoughtful deliberation. I didn't vote for you to be just another "good old boy" who flexes macho muscles. try to do better! Anne Thomas

Gov Perdue's pandering on this issue is shameless and cliche.  Not what I voted for.  Do something about the economy rather than beating up on prisoners.  If I'd wanted that, I could have voted Republican.

Thank you.   Hang tough, please.    "Life" should mean for the rest of one's life on this planet.    There should be no "good behavior credits".    They were convicted and sentenced for violent crimes.   Those crimes should never be excused nor pardoned because of a moment of good behavior.
Please do not release these criminals.

Well done, Governor!  This ruling by the Supreme Court is going to cost a wad of money for the state to attempt to fix, where as, if the original sentences were left in place, those costs would not be incurred.  Let me also state that I am a firm  believer in the death penalty and believe that these kinds of criminals will never contribute to the community in any possible manner. and to house, feed, and pamper them in prison is wasteful and a drain on the same community they have offended.  Why do we feel the need to "store" these kinds of maniacs?

Governor Says Offenders Will Not Be Turned Loose

Statement from the Governor Regarding Prisoner Release:

When I learned that the Supreme Court had issued a ruling that meant offenders serving life in prison would be released after a mere 35 years, I was appalled. Like most of my fellow North Carolinians, I believe life should mean life, and even if a life sentence is defined as 80 years, getting out after only 35 is simply unacceptable.

Since that ruling, my staff and I have been doing everything we can to stop the release of these rapists and murderers. These are people who have been denied parole repeatedly, and many who have numerous infractions during their prison stay. I do not believe they are ready for release onto the streets of our communities.

While I understand the decision of the Supreme Court, I believe there remain unresolved legal issues that were not addressed. Before Mr. Bowden or any other offender affected by the Court’s decision is turned loose, these issues must be heard.

At issue is the application of good behavior credits to these violent offenders serving life sentences since the 1970s. Since last week, we have been scrutinizing the good behavior credits applied to the 20 inmates eligible for immediate release. This morning, legal counsel and Department of Correction staff met with officials who oversaw the application of those behavior credits during the 1980s. At the time, the DOC gave inmates day-for-day credits under the authority of the then-secretary. There is a real question whether the General Assembly intended for the DOC to have that kind of authority. I do not believe they did, and my legal counsel agrees. This raises the very real question that these inmates should not be eligible for early release.

Mr. Bowden’s case is in the process of being sent back to the trial court to recalculate his sentence. These issues can be resolved by the courts.

Until these new legal issues have been resolved by the courts, Mr. Bowden and the other violent offenders will not be released.

Upcoming celebrations include:

Southeast Governors Announce Formation of a South Atlantic Alliance

Gov. Perdue announced this week that she has joined three other governors of Southeastern states in an agreement to work together to better manage and protect ocean and coastal resources, ensure regional economic sustainability and respond to disasters such as hurricanes.

The agreement establishes an alliance among North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Georgia. The South Atlantic Alliance will leverage resources from each state to protect and maintain healthy coastal ecosystems, keep waterfronts working, enhance clean ocean and coastal waters and help make communities more resilient after they’ve been struck by natural disasters.

The alliance was signed by North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue, South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist.

“All four governors realize that we are facing considerable challenges to sustain our coastal resources for future generations,” said North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue. “This alliance will enable us to work together to protect our ocean environment and the health and economic well-being of the people dependent on those resources.”

This Governors’ South Atlantic Alliance is a state-led partnership leveraging resources from the public and private sectors, business and industry communities, local governments, federal agencies, academic institutions, and non-governmental organizations to address regional priorities.

All of the Governors welcomed the agreement as an example of the ability to discuss and act regionally on common issues paramount to the South’s economic vitality and quality of life.

Hi, my name is Theresa Hill and I just want to say HOOORAH to the governor for not letting these harden criminals out. I agree with the governor, if their  sentences were for life then they should serve it for life.

Governor Says Offenders Will Not Be Turned Loose

When I learned that the Supreme Court had issued a ruling that meant offenders serving life in prison would be released after a mere 35 years, I was appalled. Like most of my fellow North Carolinians, I believe life should mean life, and even if a life sentence is defined as 80 years, getting out after only 35 is simply unacceptable. 
Since that ruling, my staff and I have been doing everything we can to stop the release of these rapists and murderers. These are people who have been denied parole repeatedly, and many who have numerous infractions during their prison stay. I do not believe they are ready for release onto the streets of our communities. 
While I understand the decision of the Supreme Court, I believe there remain unresolved legal issues that were not addressed. Before Mr. Bowden or any other offender affected by the Courtâ€™s decision is turned loose, these issues must be heard. 
At issue is the application of good behavior credits to these violent offenders serving life sentences since the 1970s. Since last week, we have been scrutinizing the good behavior credits applied to the 20 inmates eligible for immediate release. This morning, legal counsel and Department of Correction staff met with officials who oversaw the application of those behavior credits during the 1980s. At the time, the DOC gave inmates day-for-day credits under the authority of the then-secretary. There is a real question whether the General Assembly intended for the DOC to have that kind of authority. I do not believe they did, and my legal counsel agrees. This raises the very real question that these inmates should not be eligible for early release.
 Mr. Bowdenâ€™s case is in the process of being sent back to the trial court to recalculate his sentence. These issues can be resolved by the courts.
 Until these new legal issues have been resolved by the courts, Mr. Bowden and the other violent offenders will not be released.

Gov. Perdue announced this week that she has joined three other governors of Southeastern states in an agreement to work together to better manage and protect ocean and coastal resources, ensure regional economic sustainability and respond to disasters such as hurricanes.

> The agreement establishes an alliance among North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Georgia.

> The alliance was signed by North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue, South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist.

> “All four governors realize that we are facing considerable challenges to sustain our coastal resources for future generations,” said North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue. “This alliance will enable us to work together to protect our ocean environment and the health and economic well-being of the people dependent on those resources.”

> This Governors’ South Atlantic Alliance is a state-led partnership leveraging resources from the public and private sectors, business and industry communities, local governments, federal agencies, academic institutions, and non-governmental organizations to address regional priorities.

> All of the Governors welcomed the agreement as an example of the ability to discuss and act regionally on common issues paramount to the South’s economic vitality and quality of life.

I'm very pleased with your decision on this,I agree,life means life.But on another subject,I would ask that you give some thought to involuntary annexation and ban them from our state.Municipalities use this as a tax grab,and the affected residents are the ones who suffer.As bad as the economy these days and the importance of saving every dollar,municipalites should be made to stop taking in land just for a tax base.If you get a chance I truly hope that you give this some consideration.Thanks for your time.

Get over your resentment - or is it about profit for the prisons?
How about real rehabilitation for these people?

Sincerely,

Statement from the Governor Regarding Prisoner Release:
When I learned that the Supreme Court had issued a ruling that meant offenders serving life in prison would be released after a mere 35 years, I was appalled. Like  most of my fellow North Carolinians, I believe life should mean life, and even if a life sentence is defined as 80 years, getting out after only 35 is simply unacceptable.
Since that ruling, my staff and I have been doing everything we can to stop the release of these rapists and murderers. These are people who have been denied parole repeatedly, and many who have numerous infractions during their prison stay.  I do not believe they are ready for release onto the streets of our communities.
While I understand the decision of the Supreme Court, I believe there remain unresolved legal issues that were not addressed. Before Mr. Bowden or any other offender affected by the Court’s decision is turned loose, these issues must be heard.
At issue is the application of good behavior credits to these violent offenders serving life sentences since the 1970s. Since last week, we have been scrutinizing the good behavior credits applied to the 20 inmates eligible for immediate release. This morning, legal counsel and Department of Correction staff met with officials who oversaw the application of those behavior credits during the 1980s. At the time, the DOC gave inmates day-for-day credits under the authority of the then-secretary. There  is a real question whether the General Assembly intended for the DOC to have that kind of authority. I do not believe they did, and my legal counsel agrees. This raises the very real question that these inmates should not be eligible for early release.
Mr. Bowden’s case is in the process of being sent back to the trial court to recalculate his sentence. These issues can be resolved by the courts.
Until these new legal issues have been resolved by the courts, Mr. Bowden and the other violent offenders will not be released.

Southeast Governors Announce Formation of a South Atlantic Alliance
Gov. Perdue announced this week that she has joined three other governors of Southeastern states in an agreement to work together to better manage and protect ocean and coastal resources, ensure regional economic sustainability and respond to disasters such as <unknown.bmp>hurricanes.
The agreement establishes an alliance among North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Georgia. The South Atlantic Alliance will leverage resources from each state to protect and maintain healthy coastal ecosystems, keep waterfronts working,  enhance clean ocean and coastal waters and help make communities more resilient after they’ve been struck by natural disasters.
The alliance was signed by North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue, South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist.
“All four governors realize that we are facing considerable challenges to sustain our coastal resources for future generations,” said North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue. “This alliance will enable us to work together to protect our ocean environment  and the health and economic well-being of the people dependent on those resources.”
This Governors’ South Atlantic Alliance is a state-led partnership leveraging resources from the public and private sectors, business and industry communities, local governments, federal agencies, academic institutions, and non-governmental organizations to address regional priorities.
All of the Governors welcomed the agreement as an example of the ability to discuss and act regionally on common issues paramount to the South’s economic vitality and quality of life.

There is a reason for laws--to enforce them.  Please don't take the law into your own hands.  This seems to be a personal opinion.  If you never made a mistake, then cast the first stone.  They served the time, obeyed the standards and policies set by the system.  Let them go!  So many others have been let go.  They should not be treated any different.

Thank you for your efforts to prevent the release of  "Life termers" in prison.

My question is this!
 When did YOU first learn of the NC Supreme Court's ruling? and why are you just now attempting to prohibit the release of these prisoners?

Respectfully submitted,

Governor,

Good for you and thank you!

We may disagree on some things, but on this issue you are absolutely correct.

What can I do to help keep these bad people in jail?

Dear Governor Perdue:  Thank you for your recent action regarding making sure prisoners with life sentences will stay in prison.  One of the best ways to reduce death sentences is to assure juries that prisoners given life will actually get life.

Statement from the Governor Regarding Prisoner Release

Governor Says Offenders Will Not Be Turned Loose



When I learned that the Supreme Court had issued a ruling that meant offenders serving life in prison would be released after a mere 35 years, I was appalled. Like most of my fellow North Carolinians, I believe life should mean life, and even if a life sentence is defined as 80 years, getting out after only 35 is simply unacceptable.

Since that ruling, my staff and I have been doing everything we can to stop the release of these rapists and murderers. These are people who have been denied parole repeatedly, and many who have numerous infractions during their prison stay. I do not believe they are ready for release onto the streets of our communities.

While I understand the decision of the Supreme Court, I believe there remain unresolved legal issues that were not addressed. Before Mr. Bowden or any other offender affected by the Court’s decision is turned loose, these issues must be heard.

At issue is the application of good behavior credits to these violent offenders serving life sentences since the 1970s. Since last week, we have been scrutinizing the good behavior credits applied to the 20 inmates eligible for immediate release. This morning, legal counsel and Department of Correction staff met with officials who oversaw the application of those behavior credits during the 1980s. At the time, the DOC gave inmates day-for-day credits under the authority of the then-secretary. There is a real question whether the General Assembly intended for the DOC to have that kind of authority. I do not believe they did, and my legal counsel agrees. This raises the very real question that these inmates should not be eligible for early release.

Mr. Bowden’s case is in the process of being sent back to the trial court to recalculate his sentence. These issues can be resolved by the courts.

Until these new legal issues have been resolved by the courts, Mr. Bowden and the other violent offenders will not be released.

Not only do you have the legal responsibility to let these  people go, you have the opportunity to demonstrate how they will be transitioned back into society. my friend Sam Garrison told me that if we incarcerate someone more than 13 yrs we might as well understand we were going to look after them forever.Bryan Seagondollar Morrisville nc

Gov. Perdue announced this week that she has joined three other governors of Southeastern states in an agreement to work together to better manage and protect ocean and coastal resources, ensure regional economic sustainability and respond to disasters such as hurricanes.

> The agreement establishes an alliance among North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Georgia. The South Atlantic Alliance will leverage resources from each state to protect and maintain healthy coastal ecosystems, keep waterfronts working, enhance clean ocean and coastal waters and help make communities more resilient after they’ve been struck by natural disasters.

> The alliance was signed by North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue, South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist.

> “All four governors realize that we are facing considerable challenges to sustain our coastal resources for future generations,” said North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue. “This alliance will enable us to work together to protect our ocean environment and the health and economic well-being of the people dependent on those resources.”

> This Governors’ South Atlantic Alliance is a state-led partnership leveraging resources from the public and private sectors, business and industry communities, local governments, federal agencies, academic institutions, and non-governmental organizations to address regional priorities.

> All of the Governors welcomed the agreement as an example of the ability to discuss and act regionally on common issues paramount to the South’s economic vitality and quality of life.

Governor Perdue & Staff,
Please accept the heartfelt thanks of both my family and me for staying the release of the 20 prisioners who were to be released on Oct.. 29th.
My sister was the victim of John Montgomery who was to be released. Needless to say, she was terrified at the thought of having to face each day knowing that animal was again on the prowl for either her or young girls.
Our family has been met with tremendous support from the  Victims Assistance Services. They have offered many wonderful suggestions to protect her and make her as safe as possible.
My sister was interviewed by Scott Sexton of the Winston-Salem Journal and it appeared in the October 25 edition.
My father has written an article for the Journal we hope will be published soon. I am attaching that article along with my mom's letter for you.
Thanks for all you did and please keep fighting for families like ours whose lives have been touched by these monsters. Thank you so much!
Robin Human

Comment: Ma'am, I wanted to thank you for blocking the release of the convicted murderers/rapists that was recently being contemplated. When I first heard that might happen, and reviewed the charges of the inmates involved, my first thought was, "Does no one care about the women and children of this State?" How could law enforcement turns their backs on us like that?? Thank you for stepping up to the plate and protecting the women and children of your State. I am thankful you had the strength and courage to do so. I am sure many other rape survivors feel the same way I do. In gratitude and appreciation, Pam Marx Raleigh, NC

Governor Hon. Bev Perdue,
I am so thankful for what you have done for me and my family.  You've helped keep a murderer, someone who killed a member of my family, in jail, and deservedly so.
Words just can't express how thankful I am.  I teared up a bit when i heard the news.
Thank you for all your hard work and I hope that you continue the fight.
Sincerely,
MJ Hurley

Dear Govenor Perdue,

I want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for not releasing the murderer that killed my grandmother, Norma Ehrhart.  She was killed in 1975 at a local 7-11 in Fayetteville, North Carolina.  My mother was pregnant with me during that time so I did not have the chance to meet her.  To this day, I wonder what it would of been like to have my grandmother in my life.  So again, thank you and God bless.

I wanted to let you know that I am so glad that you are doing everything you can to keep these people behind bars.  One of the victims of Bobby Bowden was my best friends mother. 

My in-laws were killed in a car wreck 10 yrs ago caused by a "released" criminal.  He was drinking at the time, but since he was not caught until the next night, that could not be proved.  He only spent 7 yrs in prison for causing 2 deaths of the most wonderful people I ever knew.  Ever since then, I have my doubts about the "just" in justice system and this so-called structured sentencing in N.C.  I have lived here since 1977 and for the first time voted last year.  Unless something changes, I will vote for "you" again.
THANKS AGAIN

Innocent 5 year old Shaniyah Davis was unfairly, unjustly killed as the news says, We parents are constantly afraid for our babies.Something must be done please....We are so scared..

Governor Perdue, thank you so much for taking to task the court ruling regarding the early, unconditional release of some very bad prisoners. I'm not concerned about how good their behavior may have been in prison but I am concerned about how bad their behavior may be should they be released back into our society. The case of the 5 year old child in Fayetteville who was kidnapped, viciously raped and murdered should be a wakeup call to all of us, including our judges. Animals like that need to be locked up forever. That is the only defense we have. The news this morning reported the retiring district attorney in Forsyth County has filed a complaint against a judge who is allowing people to plea to a lesser charge without due process being observed in the courts. I didn't hear it all but I'm very glad the district attorney is honorable enough to bring this issue to the attention of the system before he leaves office. He didn't have to do anything. It would have been very easy for him to just shrug his shoulders, clean out his desk and walk away. It's encouraging to know that most of the people who serve our great state really do care about right and justice and fairness.

Thank you again for your continued vigilence regarding the prison situation.

Gail Gurley
Archdale, N. C.

> Gov. Perdue Establishes the NC Innovation Council

Gov. Perdue on Monday announced the creation of the first North Carolina Innovation Council.  The purpose of the Council is to foster strategic investments and policies in the growing knowledge and innovation economy.  Perdue made the announcement after touring a lab in the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in Winston-Salem.
>  
> “To continue growing jobs in North Carolina we must make sure this state is poised to compete globally in the 21st century,” said Perdue.  “Innovation is North Carolina’s launch pad to success in the global economy, and it’s a primary way for us to maintain and sharpen our competitive edge.”

> Executive Order No. 29 establishes the North Carolina Innovation Council and empowers it to advise the Governor on:

> • coordinating public and private investments and policies to promote innovation;
> • moving innovative ideas from the lab to the marketplace more efficiently; and
> • strengthening collaboration among business, academia, state and local government.

> The Council’s membership will draw on a broad spectrum of expertise in entrepreneurship, science, academia and government. It will be co-chaired by Steve Nelson, managing partner of the Wakefield Group, and Al Delia, senior advisor to the Governor.

> Gov. Perdue, Microsoft Unveil New Partnership to Offer Job Training

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced that North Carolina will join forces with Microsoft in an innovative, public-private partnership to provide free technology training to individuals across the state. The Governor joined Gail Thomas Flynn, Microsoft’s Vice President of State and Local Government, at the Harris Campus of Central Piedmont Community College to applaud the unique partnership titled “Microsoft Elevate America.”

> “This partnership will provide North Carolinians with another opportunity to retrain for today’s new economy,” Gov. Perdue said. “At a time when businesses are seeking a highly qualified, well trained workforce, Elevate America can provide potential employees with new skills to succeed.”

> Microsoft is partnering with the North Carolina Community College System, the Division of Workforce Development in the N.C. Department of Commerce and the N.C. Employment Security Commission to distribute a total of 23,700 training vouchers during the next 90 days across the state. Courses range from basic technology literacy to intermediate-level technology skills. A portion of the vouchers will be issued to North Carolina residents for Microsoft Certification Exams, all at no cost to the recipients.

> For additional information regarding the Microsoft vouchers and locations where citizens can obtain a voucher in North Carolina, visit <https://secure.ncjoblinkmis.com/>https://secure.ncjoblinkmis.com/ and click on the Microsoft Elevate America link.  

> Affidavit Filed to Prevent Prisoner Release Without Parole

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced that the Department of Correction is putting in place a plan to comply with the decisions of the appellate courts in the State v. Bowden case.  The Department has calculated unconditional release dates for the affected inmates.  According to these calculations, the earliest unconditional release date is scheduled for 2054.

> “I will continue to pursue all legal means of preventing the release of these inmates without any review by the parole board or any post-release supervision,” said Gov. Perdue.  “I have asked Sec. Keller to review all records to ensure that the inmates are not awarded any credits for which they are not eligible.”

> Pursuant to the court decision, DOC has calculated unconditional release dates for those prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes committed between April 8, 1974 and June 30, 1978.  For this group of offenders, records had previously shown release dates of “LIFE,” reflecting that no unconditional release was thought to be available to them.  These sentences must now be treated as statutory life sentences of 80 years.

> DOC Secretary Alvin Keller has directed that for each life sentence imposed for crimes during this time period, the unconditional release date shall be calculated as 80 years minus applicable jail credit earned while the prisoner awaited conviction and sentencing.

> As has been the practice of the DOC for at least 50 years, Secretary Keller will continue awarding good behavior credits for prisoners with life sentences only for purposes of earning a more favorable custody grade, for becoming eligible for parole or when the Governor commutes a prisoner’s sentence.  Such credits will not be awarded for purposes of calculating an unconditional release date.  This has been the procedure of the Department of Correction since at least 1955, during which time the head of the corrections agency has held statutory authority to establish rules and regulations as to grades of prisoners, rewards and privileges applicable to the classification of prisoners and allowances of time for good behavior.

> The Fair Sentencing Act passed in 1981 excluded Class A and B felons from receiving good behavior credits for purposes of unconditional release from prison [15A-1340.1 (a)].

> “I cannot see any meaningful difference between prisoners with statutory life sentences of 80 years and Class A and B felons under the Fair Sentencing Act in that their crimes are similarly heinous,” said Keller.

> The DOC has filed an affidavit from Secretary Keller explaining this release date calculation in Cleveland Superior Court for the State v. Wilbur William Folston case. Similar affidavits will be filed in the Bowden case and others where judges have ordered release dates to be calculated for similarly situated inmates.

> Gov. Perdue Launches eLearningNC.gov

Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday announced the launch of <http://elearningnc.gov/>eLearningNC.gov, the entry point to all the eLearning resources North Carolina has to offer.  The new web site will provide an easy one-stop-shop for any North Carolinian, from K-12 students to life-long learners, who wants to take advantage of online learning such as the NC Virtual Public School, online courses from community colleges or universities, and online career building.

>  “Over the last 10 years, technology has revolutionized the way we live and work – and I’m committed to using it to revolutionize the way we teach and learn,” said Perdue.  “With the click of a mouse, anyone in North Carolina will be able to access online learning through this new web site.  A highly-educated workforce, highly-proficient in technology, is key to keeping North Carolina competitive in the high-tech global economy.”

> <http://elearningnc.gov/>> eLearningNC.gov was created by a partnership between the Office of the Governor, the North Carolina Education Cabinet, and the North Carolina eLearning Commission.

> eLearning provides all K-12 students, regardless of location or background, with the ability to take online courses that would normally not be available to them.  Additionally, eLearning provides all college students and adults with the opportunity to take courses and learn new skills through retraining or advanced degrees.

> Perdue Announces Investments in Green Economy

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday announced that 18 small North Carolina companies will receive grants up to $100,000 to develop and market promising green and alternative energy technologies and products.  It is the third round of grants distributed by the state Department of Commerce’s Green Business Fund and puts more than $1 million in federal Recovery Act dollars to work in North Carolina.

> “North Carolina continues to position itself as a leader in the emerging green economy with these kinds of smart investments in promising technologies and products,” said Gov. Perdue.  “These creative entrepreneurs and businesses are turning green into gold by growing new companies and creating jobs.”

> It is estimated that more than 200 private sector jobs will be created as a result of the grants, spread across 18 cities and spanning 18 counties in North Carolina.  The federal Recovery dollars come through the N.C. Energy Office’s State Energy Program.

> About half the projects fell under the “environmentally conscious clean technology and renewable energy” category while the remainder fell under the green building and biofuels categories.  The awards ranged in amounts from - $31,985 to $100,000.

> Gov. Perdue Requests Disaster Assistance for Haywood County Businesses Affected by Rockslide Closure

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday requested assistance from the federal government for businesses affected by the closure of I-40 due to the rockslide of Oct. 25. In asking for a U.S. Small Business Administration disaster declaration, Gov. Perdue sought funding to help businesses in Haywood County cover normal operating expenses. If approved, the declaration will make low-interest loans available to help eligible business owners pay expenses until the interstate reopens. Also eligible will be Buncombe, Henderson, Jackson, Swain and Transylvania counties.

> “Interstate 40 is a major commercial route through western North Carolina and many local businesses depend upon that traffic for their livelihood,” Perdue said. “These federal loans would offer needed assistance to businesses that have been impacted since the rockslide.”

> Several business owners have asked the state for financial assistance after they experienced a dramatic decrease in business activity over the past three weeks. An SBA disaster declaration for economic injury would enable business owners to apply for low interest loans to pay for repairs and loss of revenue.  If the request is approved, business owners will be advised of the process for applying for loans.

> Gov. Perdue Makes Emergency Declaration for Dare County

Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday signed an emergency declaration to help Dare County recover from the heavy rain and flooding that saturated the area last week as Tropical Storm Ida moved through North Carolina. The declaration of a State of Emergency is the first step in seeking federal funds to help clear debris and repair N.C. 12, as it enables the N.C. Department of Transportation to request funding assistance from the Federal Highway Administration.

> “Our local and state emergency management and transportation officials have worked tirelessly since the storm rolled in last week,” Perdue said. “Crews are working as quickly as possible to reopen the road and coming up with alternative emergency routes in the meantime. With the tremendous amounts of rain that soaked our entire state and the high winds, we’re extremely fortunate that there was not more damage.”

> Gov. Perdue toured portions of Dare County and the Outer Banks on Tuesday and met with local emergency and transportation officials.

> Job Announcements in McDowell and Richmond Counties

> North Cove Springs, a regional producer of bottled water from natural springs, will expand its production facility in McDowell County.  The company will invest more than $6.3 million and create 138 jobs in Marion.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $310,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

> “North Carolina’s business-friendly policies and highly skilled workforce remain attractive to growing companies looking for the ideal location to expand,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Our state is the perfect platform for successful firms like this one to compete and thrive in a national market.”

> North Cove Springs, of Marion, whose ownership includes Able Rebuilders LLC, a national tools remanufacturer headquartered in Florida, taps water from natural springs.  North Cove bottles, markets and distributes the spring water and naturally flavored water beverages to regional and national retailers.

Please thank "Governor Bev" for me regarding her stand on preventing 
prisoner release without parole.  My husband was brutally killed fifteen 
years ago.  Kenneth Stevens shot him at close range three times -- twice 
in his head and once in his neck.  My husband had been the victim of an 
extortionist group to protect me and a daughter who lived with us from 
being killed.  When he no longer had any cash that was in his name only, 
they killed him.  Our District Attorney allowed this killer to plead 
second degree murder and did everything he could to keep me from making 
a statement at the trial.  He demanded that I show him what I had 
written.  Fortunately, I had guessed he might do this and had written 
two statements, one that I showed him and one I kept.  He didn't like 
the one I showed him and when the judge asked if I wanted to make a 
statement the DA jumped from his seat and said, "Your Honor, Mrs. 
Anderson really isn't up to this."  I stated that I was, indeed,  and 
gave the statement he had not seen.  He had changed judges on me at the 
last minute and had a woman who had been very lenient with a guy who had 
killed a student at UNCC.  I knew, however, once I looked into her eyes, 
that she would be an honest judge.  And, indeed, she was.  Once I had 
given my statement she sentenced Kenneth Stevens to Life, although at 
that time I didn't realize that Life could be a really short period of 
time.  I now have to keep up with where he is (They keep moving him 
around!) and write letters every three years in an effort to keep him 
there.  He had been allowed to sit directly in front of me and my two 
daughters in the Court room and kept looking around and leering at them 
after JITTER-BUGGING into the court room despite the fact that there 
were chains on his ankles.  He had waved at the guys sitting in the 
court room, most of them being co-horts of his.  After sentencing 
him,.the judge told everyone in the court room to leave in order to 
allow "the family" to leave in peace.  The Assistant DA was very nice to 
us.  The DA barely spoke.  TO HAVE KENNETH STEVENS become, at a later 
date, one who is allowed to leave prison would be to place me and the 
daughter who lives with me in a very stressful situation.  This year was 
one of the "third" years when he is given a review.  I sent a note to 
Governor Perdue and one to the person in charge of the place Stevens is 
presently incarcerated.  I thank them and God that he was not released.  
I know the horrible stress and fear when this is remotely possible, so 
our Governor's stand on the possibility of those who were going to be 
released "...without any review by the parole board or any post-release 
supervision"  is one for which I shall be eternally grateful!  AT LAST 
we have a governor that I hope will be there as long as she can tolerate 
all the problems I know she will face during her tenure!  Please let her 
know that she is always in my prayers!

Dear Governor Purdue: Thank you so very much for the stand youÂ  have taken against the NC Supreme Court decision. My wife, Norma Jean Ehrhart, was murdered by Bobby Bowden in August, 1975. He took away my wife and mother of four children. Also two grandchildren, one a baby and unborn.
Â 
You have mine and my familie's deepest gratitude and respect. I hope you will reconsider your decision not to run for a second term. I know you would have five votes.
Â 
Sincerely,
Â 
Richard A Ehrhart

Prisoner release? Where were these people when Mario Mc Nill was released to rape and kill that little girl from Fayetteville, It is so upsetting to hear about this, This guy has been in so much trouble including shooting at a cop and YET he is OUT to do MORE There is NO Excuse for this animal to be loose on our streets. I am embarrassed for N.C
Stop this now, Castrate everyone of those animals once they have been proven guilty. Then put them where they belong for the rest of their life. Save a few bucks and endanger everyone else? Makes a lot of sense?

Gov. Perdue Establishes the NC Innovation Council

Gov. Perdue on Monday announced the creation of the first North Carolina Innovation Council.  The purpose of the Council is to foster strategic investments and policies in the growing knowledge and innovation economy.  Perdue made the announcement after touring a lab in the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in Winston-Salem.

â€œTo continue growing jobs in North Carolina we must make sure this state is poised to compete globally in the 21st century,â€ said Perdue.  â€œInnovation is North Carolinaâ€™s launch pad to success in the global economy, and itâ€™s a primary way for us to maintain and sharpen our competitive edge.â€
Executive Order No. 29 establishes the North Carolina Innovation Council and empowers it to advise the Governor on:
â€¢ coordinating public and private investments and policies to promote innovation;
â€¢ moving innovative ideas from the lab to the marketplace more efficiently; and
â€¢ strengthening collaboration among business, academia, state and local government.
The Councilâ€™s membership will draw on a broad spectrum of expertise in entrepreneurship, science, academia and government. It will be co-chaired by Steve Nelson, managing partner of the Wakefield Group, and Al Delia, senior advisor to the Governor.

Gov. Perdue, Microsoft Unveil New Partnership to Offer Job Training

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced that North Carolina will join forces with Microsoft in an innovative, public-private partnership to provide free technology training to individuals across the state. The Governor joined Gail Thomas Flynn, Microsoftâ€™s Vice President of State and Local Government, at the Harris Campus of Central Piedmont Community College to applaud the unique partnership titled â€œMicrosoft Elevate America.â€
â€œThis partnership will provide North Carolinians with another opportunity to retrain for todayâ€™s new economy,â€ Gov. Perdue said. â€œAt a time when businesses are seeking a highly qualified, well trained workforce, Elevate America can provide potential employees with new skills to succeed.â€
Microsoft is partnering with the North Carolina Community College System, the Division of Workforce Development in the N.C. Department of Commerce and the N.C. Employment Security Commission to distribute a total of 23,700 training vouchers during the next 90 days across the state. Courses range from basic technology literacy to intermediate-level technology skills. A portion of the vouchers will be issued to North Carolina residents for Microsoft Certification Exams, all at no cost to the recipients.
For additional information regarding the Microsoft vouchers and locations where citizens can obtain a voucher in North Carolina, visit <https://secure.ncjoblinkmis.com/>https://secure.ncjoblinkmis.com/ and click on the Microsoft Elevate America link.  

Affidavit Filed to Prevent Prisoner Release Without Parole

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced that the Department of Correction is putting in place a plan to comply with the decisions of the appellate courts in the State v. Bowden case.  The Department has calculated unconditional release dates for the affected inmates.  According to these calculations, the earliest unconditional release date is scheduled for 2054.
â€œI will continue to pursue all legal means of preventing the release of these inmates without any review by the parole board or any post-release supervision,â€ said Gov. Perdue.  â€œI have asked Sec. Keller to review all records to ensure that the inmates are not awarded any credits for which they are not eligible.â€
Pursuant to the court decision, DOC has calculated unconditional release dates for those prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes committed between April 8, 1974 and June 30, 1978.  For this group of offenders, records had previously shown release dates of â€œLIFE,â€ reflecting that no unconditional release was thought to be available to them.  These sentences must now be treated as statutory life sentences of 80 years.
DOC Secretary Alvin Keller has directed that for each life sentence imposed for crimes during this time period, the unconditional release date shall be calculated as 80 years minus applicable jail credit earned while the prisoner awaited conviction and sentencing.
As has been the practice of the DOC for at least 50 years, Secretary Keller will continue awarding good behavior credits for prisoners with life sentences only for purposes of earning a more favorable custody grade, for becoming eligible for parole or when the Governor commutes a prisonerâ€™s sentence.  Such credits will not be awarded for purposes of calculating an unconditional release date.  This has been the procedure of the Department of Correction since at least 1955, during which time the head of the corrections agency has held statutory authority to establish rules and regulations as to grades of prisoners, rewards and privileges applicable to the classification of prisoners and allowances of time for good behavior.
The Fair Sentencing Act passed in 1981 excluded Class A and B felons from receiving good behavior credits for purposes of unconditional release from prison [15A-1340.1 (a)].
â€œI cannot see any meaningful difference between prisoners with statutory life sentences of 80 years and Class A and B felons under the Fair Sentencing Act in that their crimes are similarly heinous,â€ said Keller.
The DOC has filed an affidavit from Secretary Keller explaining this release date calculation in Cleveland Superior Court for the State v. Wilbur William Folston case. Similar affidavits will be filed in the Bowden case and others where judges have ordered release dates to be calculated for similarly situated inmates.

Gov. Perdue Launches eLearningNC.gov

Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday announced the launch of <http://elearningnc.gov/>eLearningNC.gov, the entry point to all the eLearning resources North Carolina has to offer.  The new web site will provide an easy one-stop-shop for any North Carolinian, from K-12 students to life-long learners, who wants to take advantage of online learning such as the NC Virtual Public School, online courses from community colleges or universities, and online career building.
 â€œOver the last 10 years, technology has revolutionized the way we live and work â€“ and Iâ€™m committed to using it to revolutionize the way we teach and learn,â€ said Perdue.  â€œWith the click of a mouse, anyone in North Carolina will be able to access online learning through this new web site.  A highly-educated workforce, highly-proficient in technology, is key to keeping North Carolina competitive in the high-tech global economy.â€
<http://elearningnc.gov/>eLearningNC.gov was created by a partnership between the Office of the Governor, the North Carolina Education Cabinet, and the North Carolina eLearning Commission.
eLearning provides all K-12 students, regardless of location or background, with the ability to take online courses that would normally not be available to them.  Additionally, eLearning provides all college students and adults with the opportunity to take courses and learn new skills through retraining or advanced degrees.

Perdue Announces Investments in Green Economy

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday announced that 18 small North Carolina companies will receive grants up to $100,000 to develop and market promising green and alternative energy technologies and products.  It is the third round of grants distributed by the state Department of Commerceâ€™s Green Business Fund and puts more than $1 million in federal Recovery Act dollars to work in North Carolina.
â€œNorth Carolina continues to position itself as a leader in the emerging green economy with these kinds of smart investments in promising technologies and products,â€ said Gov. Perdue.  â€œThese creative entrepreneurs and businesses are turning green into gold by growing new companies and creating jobs.â€
It is estimated that more than 200 private sector jobs will be created as a result of the grants, spread across 18 cities and spanning 18 counties in North Carolina.  The federal Recovery dollars come through the N.C. Energy Officeâ€™s State Energy Program.
About half the projects fell under the â€œenvironmentally conscious clean technology and renewable energyâ€ category while the remainder fell under the green building and biofuels categories.  The awards ranged in amounts from - $31,985 to $100,000.

Gov. Perdue Requests Disaster Assistance for Haywood County Businesses Affected by Rockslide Closure

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday requested assistance from the federal government for businesses affected by the closure of I-40 due to the rockslide of Oct. 25. In asking for a U.S. Small Business Administration disaster declaration, Gov. Perdue sought funding to help businesses in Haywood County cover normal operating expenses. If approved, the declaration will make low-interest loans available to help eligible business owners pay expenses until the interstate reopens. Also eligible will be Buncombe, Henderson, Jackson, Swain and Transylvania counties.
â€œInterstate 40 is a major commercial route through western North Carolina and many local businesses depend upon that traffic for their livelihood,â€ Perdue said. â€œThese federal loans would offer needed assistance to businesses that have been impacted since the rockslide.â€
Several business owners have asked the state for financial assistance after they experienced a dramatic decrease in business activity over the past three weeks. An SBA disaster declaration for economic injury would enable business owners to apply for low interest loans to pay for repairs and loss of revenue.  If the request is approved, business owners will be advised of the process for applying for loans.

Gov. Perdue Makes Emergency Declaration for Dare County

Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday signed an emergency declaration to help Dare County recover from the heavy rain and flooding that saturated the area last week as Tropical Storm Ida moved through North Carolina. The declaration of a State of Emergency is the first step in seeking federal funds to help clear debris and repair N.C. 12, as it enables the N.C. Department of Transportation to request funding assistance from the Federal Highway Administration.
â€œOur local and state emergency management and transportation officials have worked tirelessly since the storm rolled in last week,â€ Perdue said. â€œCrews are working as quickly as possible to reopen the road and coming up with alternative emergency routes in the meantime. With the tremendous amounts of rain that soaked our entire state and the high winds, weâ€™re extremely fortunate that there was not more damage.â€
Gov. Perdue toured portions of Dare County and the Outer Banks on Tuesday and met with local emergency and transportation officials.

I strongly feel that the governor has better things to do than open up the state to finance a huge law suite that tax payers may have to pay out ,if she loses against the court regarding the prisoners. Tax payers didn't vote for law to pay out huge sums of money ,but to save money. Would you be willing to gamble your own money in this case  ?

With the tremendous amounts of rain that soaked our entire state and the high winds, we’re extremely fortunate that there was not more damage.”
Gov. Perdue toured portions of Dare County and the Outer Banks on Tuesday and met with local emergency and transportation officials.
