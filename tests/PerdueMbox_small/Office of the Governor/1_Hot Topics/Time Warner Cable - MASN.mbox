Governor Perdue:

I can't watch Baltimore Orioles and Washington National games at all from my home in Charlotte, NC, even if I buy the MLB package because the games are blacked out due to contractual agreements with local blackouts.  All because Time Warner refuses to carry MASN.  

The Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) is the local source for televised sports programming including 322 Major League Baseball games, NCAA basketball, football and lacrosse, and tons of local sports programming I can't get anywhere else.

My neighbors with DirecTV and Dish already get MASN, but my cable company (Time Warner) refuses to carry the network.  There are no cable company competitors in my area, so unless I switch to satellite, which I don't want to do for many reasons, I cannot watch these baseball games.  However I am at point not where I am fed up and might have to make the switch, rather than live my entire adult life not being able to watch my favorite team.

It's time for Time Warner to carry MASN.

Sincerely,

Michael Regan

Time Warner-First I want to THANK you for adding the Big Ten Network.  I'm from the Big Ten Area and love seeing my teams playing here on TWC.  I ask that you please add MASN and NFL Network to the package.  I am willing to pay a few dollars more for these channels, whether they are on the basic package or the sports tier.  I am unable to see any Orioles or Nationals games even though I have the MLB Extra Innings package since they are on MASN.  I also want to be able to see the NFL games on the NFL Network during the season.  Please find a way to work with these companies to give the viewers these channels.  Thank you!

Governor Perdue:

It's time for Time Warner to play ball:

The Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) is the local leader in live sports entertainment including 322 Major League Baseball games, NCAA basketball, football and lacrosse, and tons of local sports programming I can't get anywhere else.

My neighbors in North Carolina with DirecTV, Dish, Mediacom, MI Connections, Reds Cable, TriCounty or Charter already get MASN, but Time Warner Cable refuses to carry the network. 

That's because Time Warner Cable is blacking out MASN and preventing me - and thousands of other local sports fans - from watching our local sports network.  And because of my provider's baseball blackout, I cannot watch the Washington Nationals or Baltimore Orioles games, which have been televised for years.

It's time for Time Warner to play ball and carry MASN.

The Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) is the local source for televised sports programming including 323 Major League Baseball games, NCAA basketball, football and lacrosse, and tons of local sports programming I can't get anywhere else.

As North Carolina's must-have sports network, MASN has televised 370 North Carolina NCAA games including East Carolina, UNC-W, NC State, Appalachian State, Elon, Campbell, Davidson, Wake Forest and more.  In fact, over 18 colleges and universities from our state have appeared on MASN.

It is so important for our impressive NCAA programs to get television exposure throughout the region so that fans, alumni, parents, students and potential recruits can enjoy our state's rich sports culture.

My neighbors with DirecTV, Dish, Mediacom or Charter already get this great sports network, but my cable company refuses to carry MASN.

That's because my provider, Time Warner, is blacking out MASN and preventing me - and thousands of other local sports fans - from watching our local sports network.

Governor Perdue

The Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) is the local source for televised sports programming including 323 Major League Baseball games, NCAA basketball, football and lacrosse, and tons of local sports programming I can't get anywhere else.

As North Carolina's must-have sports network, MASN has televised 370 North Carolina NCAA games including East Carolina, UNC-W, NC State, Appalachian State, Elon, Campbell, Davidson, Wake Forest and more.  In fact, over 18 colleges and universities from our state have appeared on MASN.

It is so important for our impressive NCAA programs to get television exposure throughout the region so that fans, alumni, parents, students and potential recruits can enjoy our state's rich sports culture.

My neighbors with DirecTV, Dish, Mediacom or Charter already get this great sports network, but my cable company refuses to carry MASN.

That's because my provider, Suddenlink, is blacking out MASN and preventing me - and thousands of other local sports fans - from watching our local sports network.  And because of Suddenlink's baseball blackout, I cannot watch the Washington Nationals or Baltimore Orioles games - which have been televised here for decades.

It's time for Suddenlink to play ball and carry MASN.

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am a resident of North Carolina and wish to express my support for the proposed Carolinas Cement plant to be built in Castle Hayne, N.C. I supported the issuance of the Draft Air Permit to Carolinas Cement and I support the issuance of the official Air Permit without delay.

A cement plant in North Carolina will have positive effects in our community in a number of ways, such as mitigating the potential shortage of this strategic material and controlling competition for foreign imports (e.g., Venezuela, Columbia and China). Greater choice of supply will impact cost on every building project, major sewer system or large scale highway project in the state, making scarce state and county funds go further while shrinking the carbon footprint associated with importing cement from overseas.

I have done my research and I know Carolinas Ce! ment and its parent company, Titan America LLC, to be organizations of great integrity with an excellent reputation for community involvement and environmental stewardship. I trust that current federal and state regulations will protect our health and safety. We, in North Carolina, are in desperate need of the jobs, revenue and taxes this project will generate. Additional information about the project is available at www.carolinascement.com.

I urge you to support Carolinas Cement and the issuance of the Air Permit without delay.

Sincerely,
Paul Ramsburg
