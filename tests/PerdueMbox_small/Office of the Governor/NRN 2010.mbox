Subject: Employment

Comment: The fact that at age 56 and the economic situation is what it is,I find myself unemployed. I see money provided by the Federal government for services and to stimulate the down turn. I see Federal money going to help the less fortunate in our society. I also see Federal money going to help prop up our state government and our state infrastructure to stablize and provide for highways ect... The fact is I have taken care of myself and family for 56 years and paid my taxes, paid my bills, and paid my way to be out of debt and have some money saved to be prepared for being unemployed and lacking income and I was wondering why our state government has not done the same thing! When my savings are gone. When I cannot pay my bills. Will my state government just write me off as one of those unfortunate statistics and continue without me? Can I expect a bailout? Check it out , our state employees had to cutback. Some have reduced hours. Some did not have thier contracts renewed. Yet the state continues on as if eveything is fine. Wish you the best; Kenneth Casper

Subject: Barbaric euthanization procedure used on animals in Robeson County

Comment: I apologize for the informality of this request, but I am appalled at the treatment of animals at the Robeson County Animal Shelter. Understanding that it isn't a "pretty" job and that an unfortunate number of animals are "put to sleep", it is come to my attention that the method of "heart-sticking" is used at this facility. If you are unfamiliar with this procedure, I have provided a URL from a Nashville television station concerning this inhumane treatment. As an animal lover who has spent considerable time and money rescuing dogs and cats throughout the Carolinas, I humbly ask that you view this news report and consider my request to ban this form of euthanasia and to make it a felony if it continues. I appreciate your time and consideration and wish you a safe, healthy, prosperous and healthy 2010. Warm regards, Ed Juaire Myrtle Beach, SC http://www.wsmv.com/video/14496229/See/index.html

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, Your state is beautiful but you need to go for a ride around Raleigh's US and Interstate highways. They have more trash then any other roads on the east coast. Who are we to say anything since we only have 11 miles of interstate in Delaware. All our roads are 90% cleaner then yours, also the surrounding states both North and South. Times are bad but other states are one sept ahead. We love your state, just take a 10 minute drive. Sincerely, George & Susan Eckert

Comment: NC is going to regret passing the smoking ban---I have personally seen this happen in other places and businesses suffer deep losses, some actually closing---tobacco was once king in NC--that's like cutting off the arm that feeds you, very stupid---most all restaurants have had smoking and non smoking sections for decaades--thre was no need for change---I will not go in and order at a bar or restaurant becaause I can't have a cigarette IF I want it---sometimes I don't even light up---it's the principle--NC has communists in it's govt---I do NOT condone communists---I can eat much cheaper at home anyway---NC WILL see a drop in tax collections becaause people will stop eating in many places---when NC turned communist I turned anti communist---there are much better ways---too sad people in Raleigh can't see that.

Comment: I praise restaurant owners who will pay the fine instead of ending the communist ban on smoking---most all restaurants have no smoking areas now and that should end it---NC is going to lose aa lot of money because of this law---restaurants will simply up prices to cover the fines--non smokers will be the butt of this situation and NC will suffer for their stupid actions.

Comment: Governor Bev Perdue: I'm "Terry J. Hokanson." If you are interested in creating high paying, environmentally friendly jobs for your unemployed constituents, as well as drastically reduce the amount of fossil fuel needed to generate electricity in every city power plant in the US, therefore drastically reduce national pollution output, then perhaps we can help each other. If you are not equipped to duke it out with highly financed fossil fuel cartels whose sucker punches are professionally masked to appear to come from anywhere but their origin, I'm also an extremely high end foldout furniture designer with a background in the design and manufacture of large jet aircraft interiors. A good example of Sheriff's Department level sucker punchers beating a defenseless light weight senseless is, typical aircraft seating starts at ten thousand dollars per chair, while my paltry slave wages are based on fraudulent police files whispered in my ear by the secret police, as what looks exactly like a black KKK stalking event out on the street softens me up for a list of bank account drain routines. Although I'm open to the possibility of setting up a very profitable aircraft interior design and manufacturing business for the right price and security conditions, I'm also a home and office interior, furniture and appliance designer, as well as a high end, slide out to double wide motor coach designer. I tried to put together a few dozen manufacturing facilities that sell their goods through a TV series that in effect resembles the 'Home Shopping Network' but I have no money or political connections. For sake of argument, would you be interested in watching a TV series about all aspects of designing, building and managing a completely self sustaining super city of a hundred million inhabitants, if you know all the plots lead to selling you the list of home and office interiors, and various other products contained therein? It would have been nice to contact you in the form of a highly respected green corporation, but I live under an extremely cloak and dagger copyright and patent theft ring that appears to be run out of the Florida Polk County Sheriff's Department. At least the Sheriff acts like a Mafia enforcer who, while in the public spotlight, chooses to deny I have or ever had anything of value worth building any level of conspiracy around, rather than deal with this 'secret police committing federal crimes on private citizens' issue. How this extortion and murder conspiracy basically gained so much momentum is, back in the 1980s, while knocking me down and stealing my intellectual property, a peeping Tom, with a great deal of surveillance and evidence tampering expertise, decided to use his political muscle to assemble a property extraction tool somewhat resembling a KKK hooded lynch mob stalking event. I stress â€˜Evidence Tampering' because, although the evidence used to knock me down and extract my property is obviously a very powerful vehicle of legal jurisdiction, it was much too fabricated to produce in a public courtroom where any acts of fraud and perjury could lead to criminal prosecution. In other words, we are talking about what amounts to a burglar who, while committing various felonies in and around your home, replaces what he has stolen with incriminating evidence which, without actually arresting you and producing this evidence in court, becomes the legal vehicle for extracting the rest of your property by authority of a fuzzy, secret police run slavery ring. Since I'm denied access to any level of file kept on me by any branch of city, county, state and federal government, I can only imagine the kid gloves used to turn me upside down and shake money out of me somewhat resemble those used on "Robert Kearns," the inventor of the 'Intermittent Windshield Wiper,' when he first began marketing his invention to the Ford Motor Company in the 1960s. In the 2008 "Flash of Genius" docudrama, the apparent legal vehicle used to lock Mr. Kearns up for psychiatric treatment occurred on a bus, when he told police the White House is calling him to Washington D.C.. How this relates to my case is, when police showed up at my home in reply to my attempts at exposing my stalker, whose specific hypnotic and subliminal tools are purposely distorted (as in, the car thief doesn't need a tow truck because your monkey brain keeps handing him your car keys) both the Sheriff and FBI insisted hypnosis and subliminal trigger mechanisms are mere constructs, fabricated by imaginative TV writers. Consequently, the legal vehicle used to lock me up for court ordered chemical treatment involves an imaginary stalker making impossible threats to my life and liberty by way of impossible tools. Another similarity to the Flash of Genius docudrama being, the Ford Motor Company severely damaged Mr. Kearns' mental state, be it by way of hypnosis or the shear stress of being ripped off by a giant bully that intentionally bogs its victims down in bureaucratic red tape and mounds of irrelevant paperwork. Ironically, during the 1978 patent infringement trial, Ford Motor Company lawyers basically declared Mr. Kearns to be little more than a psychiatric outpatient whose stay in a mental hospital proves he is undeserving of the awesome responsibility that comes with possessing a large bank roll. Is my FBI profile similar? What I'm getting at is, no matter how big your political muscles are, when you hold a good man down, a part of you gets muddied by the experience. On the other hand, besides my list of energy saving products in need of various manufacturing facilities, I also have a method for cutting the electric bills of your constituents in half. Generally, if you provide jobs for your unemployed constituents while cutting their heating, cooling and electric utility bills, they will keep you in office. The main problem with you welcoming me to boost your voter support while you in return protect me from organized crime is, both the Florida Polk County Sheriff and the FBI insist I have nothing to offer any business relationship whatsoever. Since law enforcement officials who swore an oath to protect me have so viciously attacked my credibility, I've created a few product demonstration videos designed to prove I'm nowhere near the village simpleton the Sheriff and FBI vehemently insist I am. You will find the URL to these videos under the "My Product Design Videos:" heading at the end of this document. Am I too Much Trouble To Get Votes For You?: At this writing I'm fifty two years old. I don't smoke, drink or do drugs. On the other hand, I'm certain where unethical legal teams plot to defraud small inventors out of huge profits, bogus police files that in effect resemble the insanely inaccurate intelligence reports used by President Bush to declare war on Iraq are commonplace. But then, other than a couple of TV series I tried to market, exposing a few extortion and murder methods used on me, which brought the Sheriff and FBI to my home, claiming mobsters like this just do not exist while threatening to lock me up for chemical treatment, I can hardly be construed as a possible liability. That is unless you count my tax views concerning the hand to mouth existence forced upon me by the hooded police SWAT team personnel whispering fraudulent police files and death threats in my ear while extracting my intellectual property. It seems to me if the government is going to continue its list of slavery tactics, I have the right to refuse splitting my paltry slave wages with so many billion and trillion dollar pork belly projects that can't possibly benefit me. On the other hand, the IRS would certainly make a news media event of running me over with their political steam roller, as the Sheriff and FBI files I'm not allowed access to, much less dispute in open court, are made public in order to generate a lynch mob atmosphere to the extraction of the several billion dollars my city power plant designs would net me. When I consider the IRS may allow me to keep 2/3 of that several billion dollars, if I don't put up too much of a struggle, this sounds like a plan that can save life and limb. Where I Think That Several Billion Dollars Will Come From: I always have a number of products I can't talk about in any depth because I'm not allowed to hold a patent before opening profit sharing negotiations. My most cost effective product being a method for offsetting US oil consumption by a quarter trillion dollars per year, based on a $68.50 per barrel market price. Obviously, this is an arbitrary figure since the US consumes an excess of 20 million barrels of oil per day. Therefore, at $137 per barrel, my product can offset the oil price by a half trillion dollars per year. A couple of years ago, when gas climbed over four dollars per gallon, everyone was expecting the price of oil to stabilize at $200 per barrel, and it probably would have if the economy didnâ€˜t collapse first. For sake of argument, I'll base the following formula (dollars per barrel x barrels used per day x days in a year) on a hundred dollars per barrel. Therefore, if all US consumers only need to purchase half their regular fuel supply, due to my device, this in effect translates to paying $50 per barrel as opposed to $100 per barrel. That yearly savings equals: $50 * 20,000,000 * 365 = $365,000,000,000 Of course, besides powerful oil magnates and their political lobbyists throwing every conceivable monkey wrench into the works, what also makes this potential savings so arbitrary is, if everyone somehow decided to lower their fuel costs with my device, the people controlling the oil supply would simply raise their prices back to the edge of economic collapse. On the other hand, using half the amount of fossil fuel puts half the amount of pollution into the environment, while higher fuel prices tend to force consumers to invest in renewable energy based products. In this case, please view my eleven minute video on my low cost, roof top solar systems discussed below. Note: If your political district relies on coal to generate your electricity, I also have a device that will drastically lower your power plant's toxic emissions while burning less coal. Three Very Important Pollution & Energy Conservation Questions: 1. Do you expect the fossil fuel companies to rule the energy roost well into the 21st century, and possibly beyond? 2. Do you believe if a federal law were passed today, requiring all fossil fuel utilities to double their energy output to fuel input, this could be achieved at a reasonable cost, in a reasonable length of time? 3. Do you believe the fossil fuel companies have managed to not only use their enormous political muscle to block such legislation, but also sweep valuable energy saving devices under the rug? Knocking Me Off My Inventor Soapbox: Back to the subject of the Florida Polk County Sheriff's Department performing the task of Mafia enforcer. On 2-2-2006, in response to my [super efficient, large city scale, electric generator designs, and their tiny five hundred horse power, one hundred mile per gallon descendants, to be used as automotive engines and so forth] business emails to city and state government, the Florida Polk County Sheriff showed up at my home with a court order to lock me up for chemical treatment. Consequently, before my arrest, all questioning came in the form of a condescending adult picking apart a child's best laid plans, while purposely omitting key investigative procedures such as asking me if a working prototype exists, or how long it would take to build a working prototype, or how much money I need to build a working prototype if the government gave me the protection I asked for. During my mental competency hearing, a city power plant resume, which I was attempting to send to thousands of government officials who may be interested in cutting the electric bills of their constituents in half, was the only evidence used against me. The first line in my resume, that Polk County Chemical Dosage Specialist "Chaudreh" declared to the court to be the legal vehicle for locking me up and force feeding me chemicals with a long list of known bad side effects, involved my explaining to potential investors that I live under a hooded police SWAT team that from time to time pokes and prods me with deadly weapons that can go off at any moment. Dr. Chaudreh also declared, as evidence against me in court, another line off my resume stating that the Hooded Chief of Police made movies of himself drugging me up and raping me. Since Dr. Chaudreh never once attempted to touch these hot potato subjects outside of the courtroom, perhaps to avoid getting caught peeling onions in order to create a single distorted slice that best supports his political agenda, lets just say for now that I was referring to a hypnosis based, "Candid Camera" styled, hooded police surveillance crew, appearing to invite every sort of dangerous psychopath in town to stalk me, based on fraudulent evidence the Hooded Chief of Police whispers in my ear in every public place but refuses to produce in court. Of course, speaking of the onion slice analogy, instructing Dr. Chaudreh to expend all his energies on drugging me up and convincing me I'm as dumb as a post, incapable of generating ideas and inventions that would tempt the pettiest of criminals, pretty much fits my description of the Hooded Chief of Police as well. While the Sheriff, FBI and long list of government offices have continued to deny my access to any level of files from which I can make any sort of rational decisions, since my stalker made his presence known in the early 1980s, what I'm forced to explain to you is, I was raised in a doomsday religion, taken over by a US Supreme Court judge during WWII, connected to dozens of very intense rubber hose beatings. During chemical treatment it was continually declared that I have no special abilities whatsoever that any level of conspiracy to commit fraud could possibly be based on, much less a Mafia protection rackets scam spanning city, county, state and federal government. I can only speculate this is due to the FBI withholding certain key documents requested by the Polk County Mental Court concerning me. For instance, my extremely high grade school test scores, which qualified me to disappear under a secretive government and\or corporate wing. What I was getting to is, if all this intense physical and psychological abuse I've experienced since childhood was designed to install and maintain an easily shuffled house of cards in my head, where profitable ideas and inventions I come up with are easily shuffled out of my memory, you would think Dr. Chauderh was keenly aware of this fraud scheme he entered into, while attempting to reset my mental house of cards to display "Naive Burger King skill level employee, trying to stumble on a profitable idea, hoping to sell it to a company willing to pay royalties." This brings us back to the slave traders who have me seriously hemmed in with fraudulent police files used as the legal vehicle to conduct a perpetual police strip search. Negotiating Energy Contracts Like The Big Boys: Obviously, if General Electric had a plan to keep you in office by cutting your voters electric bills in half, after all the city, county, state and federal incentives are all tallied up, you would expect that GE would come out making something like a billion dollars profit per several hundred megawatt, city power plant created. By contrast, I've been in negotiations in which the hooded police SWAT team, whispering in my ear, blackmails me with homosexual movies made of me while I was a minor. Of course, I'm depicted as a prancing faggot boy looking for love in all the wrong places, rather than a fifteen year old victim, removed by the government from a long list of very intense rubber hose beatings, connected to an intricate brainwashing conspiracy, only to be creatively posed with a black homosexual foster parent, and other incriminating movie props through the years, designed to strip away friends and political allies. On the other end of the rape spectrum, while working in Tampa Florida, at black owned "Macs Boat Tops," under a black KKK steam roller operation, in the early 1980s, the hypnotist [generating the dirty laundry games, later used to negotiate my wages, help transfer ownership of products I'm trying to develop and market, to just plain stalk me in every public place] ran a hypnotic eyes with no face scam on me which, in couple of weeks, culminated in a professional rape victim, connected to those eyes, walking into the door of Macs Boat Tops with great subliminal fanfare. Over the years, this hypnotic programming event eventually appeared to merge with several other hypnotic programming events into what amounts to hooded police SWAT team personnel jabbing a loaded gun in my back while whispering "Rapist" in my ear in every public place. In other words, what my total lack of political clout boils down to is, the Florida County of Polk assumed all legal liabilities incurred by my stalker by arresting me and muscling me through mental court over a few billion dollars in city power plant royalties. Consequently, the doctors involved in chemically treating me didn't bother denying the existence of a very hot and heavy government level peeping Tom who aggressively stalks private citizens who were never arrested for, much less convicted of a felony. Although my court ordered lockup for chemical experimentation may be nothing more than an extremely heavy handed intimidation ploy, with an intended traumatic effect similar to the KKK burning a cross in your front yard, this next sentence would only make sense if I were proven to be susceptible to various extremely potent hypnotic spells. . . Perhaps the County of Polk felt it could, at least during strategic moments that require me to make prepared statements to something resembling a news media camera crew, force me to declare that I'm much too stupid to come up with any sort of idea or invention that could possibly tempt their state of the art peeping Tom to outrageously abuse the awesome â€˜Peeping Tom\Deadly Stalker' political office he holds in my community, and every community Iâ€˜ve lived in since the 1980s. My Second Attempt At Energy Contract Negotiation: Do you believe another oil embargo, price fixing scheme, political shift within oil producing countries, and/or militant actions such as sinking US bound oil tankers will severely hobble or cripple the US in the not too distant future? Do you believe the US has already squandered the majority of it's oil supply, and is now hemorrhaging hundreds of billions of dollars per year in order to purchase oil from a rapidly shrinking supply that can only double in price every few years? Although fossil fuel is not a renewable resource, and when its gone its gone, one good short term fix would be to pass a law requiring all fossil fuel based city power plants to double their energy output to fuel input. Of course, the same type of law holds true for automotive engine manufacture, but this legislation would have to be written in terms of hundred miles per gallon to horsepower ratio. An excellent long term solution is to pass an aggressive "Fossil Fuel Reduction Act." But then, the fossil fuel companies can afford the highest powered political lobbyists money can buy, able to trash any such bill should the fossil fuel companies feel they can't easily raise prices to offset perceived losses due to this legislation. On the other hand, out of the current hundred sixty-six million registered US voters, there are perhaps a hundred fifty million voters who would overwhelmingly vote for political candidates who staunchly back a cost effective "Fossil Fuel Reduction Act" or "Renewable Energy Act" if properly rallied. One of several possible methods involves appeasing hard core environmentalists, who in turn rally votes for you. Since CO2 induced global warming seems to be a very hot topic these days, curbing fossil fuel use could keep you in office, against strong fossil fuel company opposition, if marketed correctly. For instance, a good catchall plan that appeases not only hardcore environmentalists, but the business sector, as well as the typical voter is the "Oil Embargo Proof Plan." This works by protecting all American homes and businesses from price hikes or denial of service due to any possible disruptions in international or domestic fossil fuel shipments, be they short or long term. An ideally written "Oil Embargo Proof Act" would provide fossil fuel based power at half the current cost while forcing the US energy grid to shift over to renewable energy sources wherever possible. Since renewable energy doesn't emit CO2, or get shut off as any number of international disputes arise, nearly every social, economic and special interest group is satisfied. In other words, an Oil Embargo Proof bill pushed through Congress would serve three purposes: 1. Wean America off expensive foreign and domestic fossil fuel by forcing America to go solar. 2. Drastically cut CO2 emissions and other fossil fuel related pollutants due to the first purpose of this bill. 3. Eventually turn all fossil fuel power plants into what amounts to backup generators that ideally run only when renewable resources are currently unavailable. As a possible result of this bill, the industry most likely to grow like Microsoft grew in the 1980s and 90s is â€˜Solar Farming.' Today, solar farms only make up about 1% of the US energy consumption pie chart while coal, oil and natural gas makes up a whopping 86%. As an engineer, I have a number of solar farm components that are easy to manufacture and install. I just don't have the security, money, warehouse space, equipment and manpower to make my solar farms a reality. What I mean by â€˜security' is, the purpose behind using fraudulent police files to circumvent my civil rights (as in cut off or restrict my access to goods and services, and a long list of other dirty tricks) is not only to keep me in poverty but also to aid in transferring ownership of any ideas, inventions or business enterprises I come up with. With that said and done, on a city by city basis, a series of small solar farm manufacture and installation projects, based on my designs, could easily be worked out between city planners, local businessmen and myself. For instance, most mid sized cities have hundreds if not thousands of existing warehouse and apartment rooftops that are ideal for solar farming. Of the several designs I have to choose from, perhaps a percentage of building owners need a new roof. In this case, we can install a solar collector that acts as a second roof, completely shielding the old roof from the elements. In turn, if this solar collector is mounted eight to ten feet above the roof line, this opens up a number of accessible floor space issues. Perhaps you have access to state and federal government programs designed to lend financial assistance. One example of financial help being, at this writing the US unemployment rate is 10.2%. Although, during the great depression, unemployment topped at 24.9% in 1933, the US Government was already creating jobs when unemployment reached 15% in 1931, when it began routing the unemployed into the Hoover Dam project, various park building projects, as well as interstate highway projects. Therefore, if the US Government wants to put people back to work, and then collect huge dividends on its investment, what better project than a major push to free the country from dependence on foreign oil? If, before getting another court order to lock me up for chemical treatment, government officials decide to check to see if my method of doubling electric energy output to fossil fuel input does in fact work, and it's proven that I have the most viable solution to this â€˜Solar vs. Fossil Fuel' equation, they may still cut me out of the profit loop. For instance, someone may be able to prove that my invention is merely a copy of a patent the oil companies cleverly swept under the rug before I was even born. Therefore, I should at least be compensated for bringing it back out into the light when so many people who are allowed to profit by exploiting such technological breakthroughs haven't a clue. Consequently, it doesn't make sense to produce a City Electric Power Plant Design video, much less post it on my website. On the other hand, if you are in the position to make funding available, you would have to sign a nondisclosure agreement, pending patent filing, and I'll gladly show you what I have to offer. In other words, how I fit into the above mentioned environmental consciousness picture is, I could have comfortably retired off my sci-fi movie plots, foldout furniture designs, and long list of other inventions a long time ago if the Hooded Chief of Police didn't stick a gun in my back and scam me with a long list of mental outpatient, patent theft shell games. So here I am today with no money, no patents and no future, forced to drive a wedge between my present stalker and myself by marketing a method to â€˜double electricity output to fuel input' that could easily cause a cabal of oil billionaires to anonymously reach out from virtually any private or government security network in order to protect their business interests. For instance, they may simply decide to emulate my present stalker who, in effect, nailed me to a cross in the Martin Luther King Day Parade, while making it appear the motive for the subsequent list of intimidation, slander, inconvenience games, secret police shakedown tactics, etc., used on me is "Racism." My Product Demonstration Videos: In order to dispute Polk County's devastating legal claims regarding my serious lack of intelligence, I've created three product demonstration videos. You'll find them under the "Product Design Videos" link at: http://home.earthlink.net/~terry.hokanson My first video is 2:17 long. This involves a simple concept demonstration which, after making this video, I'd learned is a Thomas Edison invention, long ago named "Cogeneration." Since less than one percent of the public use this concept to cut their home heating bills in half, you may know of someone who wants to mass produce this product. I can design and build not only a working prototype but also the assembly line that builds a number of production models. My second video is 4:46 long. I have seventeen years of upholstery related experience, five of which involves the design and manufacture of large jet aircraft interiors. Subsequently, I've demonstrated a few existing products which, as a highly skilled design engineer who modifies these existing products to meet any number of customer specifications, would make me the cornerstone to any aircraft interior design and engineering department. Of course, at ten thousand dollars per chair, it makes little sense to prove my worth by demonstrating luxury interiors that no one makes, since the ACME Aircraft Interior Company isn't paying me at least a million dollars per year as the Copycat Aircraft Interior Company across the street attempts to circumvent ACME's patents in court by proclaiming my designs to be nothing more than old Thomas Edison patents that long ago ran out. My third video is 11:34 long. If you know anyone who wants to get off the power grid but can't afford the eighty thousand dollar price tag for a photo voltaic array with a twenty year life span, I have a ten thousand dollar alternative with a hundred year life span. You'll also find a demonstration of one of my extremely hurricane resistant house designs, as well as a few other practical products in this video. If for some reason you can't get through to my home file server, or my videos fail to download, you can reach me at the address below with a short description of the problem, and I'll do everything in my power to fix it. I can also send one or more videos to you via email attachment at your request. Sincerely, Terry J. Hokanson 9440 Bryant Rd. Lakeland Florida 33809 terry.hokanson@earthlink.net

Dear New Hanover County Commissioners:

In recent TV News and now a Newspaper article some County Commissioners are reporting being threatened with lawsuits by the ABC Board. Well, that just fits in with the attitude the Board has shown from the beginning of the recent scandal.

Even more interesting given that The ABC Board recently admitted it repeatedly violated the State laws about meetings of public Boards. No defense like an offense, huh?

In a meeting last month the ABC Board decided to purchase insurance against being sued for their actions. Good timing on that matter, and no doubt one of their wiser decisions! At least for themselves if not for the public. In a newspaper article we are informed that the Board has brought another attorney to work for them in addition to their regular attorney. (Am I correct that 2 of the 3 Board members are also attorneys?)

State law seems to say that The Commissioners have the ability to remove and replace Board members "... for Cause...". An ABC Board member said they couldn't be removed unless they broke the law.

Well, the course of action in the Public Interest seems clear for the County Commissioners. If all 3 ABC Board members have violated the State Meetings Laws, that would be good "Cause" and sufficient basis to remove and replace all three.

As to the salaries of some of the Staff, it's been reported that there are no contractual restrictions preventing any of them from being fired or reduced in pay. I would hope the new Board Members would fire those who have abused their positions by manipulating their pay to unreasonable levels. I would also hope that all positions would be evaluated for proper pay levels.

I know you will all give serious consideration to this whole matter at your meeting Monday. I hope that your actions will be able to bring the ABC Board and operations back in line with the intent of the law and the goal of serving the Public Good.

Best Regards,


Joe Carney

Comment: My Dear Governor, You may feel that passing the N.C. smoking ban was a real service to your fellow Tarheels. This bill is a travisty to individual free will and once again fortifies big Gov. telling what we as NC residence can and cannot do. Putting a smoking ban on "Private Clubs" who serve only adults and their respective members should be a crime. The club should not have to be a non-profit or run by its members....this is caring your smoking ban way too far. Shame on you Bev Prudue!!!! Ben Pate

Comment: Since you don't have a contact site, I decided to write to you this way, I for one am very and I mean very displeased with your tenure so far as governor of North Carolina. To think you promised no new taxes and within 3 months of your election or so there went the cigarette tax,Now as of Jan 2nd we are no longer allowed to smoke in restuarants and bars, have you forgotten what state you live in Mrs Perdue, a tobacco state and as a voter I will not be voting for you ever again nor will most of the smoking population of North Carolina. Shame on you. yes I said shame on you. I hope that all of your emails and regular mail are filled with the same disgust that I feel for you. You will not have my vote come re-election time, but anyway thank you for letting someone read this Because obviously you don't read anything or you would know that tobacco is what put you in office and now it will take you out when your term is over. plus your too busy with the lobbists to read the negative feedback you only want the sugar coated version to make it you your office so that you can share only the positive with the media. You don't want them to dee the negative. I hope you have a blessed day Signed A former supporter and a present opponant

Subject: Robeson County Animal Shelter Putting Down 100 Animals

Comment: Governor Bev Perdue, IMMEDIATE ATTENTION: Robeson County North Carolina is planning to put down 100 animals; dogs, puppies, and cats, etc., by the opening of business on Tuesday of the current week. I find this to be ridiculous. It does not state why this is happening. Surely, as one animal comes in, one must go out but 100? There must also be other shelters somewhere which could take these animals including puppies to be put up for adoption. I am very sick that I took the time to look on Craigslist in VA and ran across this add. I don't know what good it did for them to describe exactly how this will be carried out as if they are being punished by a prison. I hope you will have a heart and put an end to this case. This should never happen much less 100 at a time. If a private person did something like this they would serve time in prison. HAVE A HEART and give these animals more time. We all know there are buildings everywhere empty which could house animals short term or even long term if someone were to try to do so. It's like animals don't count yet we use them in war, hunts for remains, fires, police work, guide dogs, etc.. Please stop this cruelty. Look at the pictures. There are some very intelligent dogs in those pictures and some are just babies. I am writing to everyone I can think of to stop this shameful act. Virginia Resident Janis Peace

Comment: I was under the impression that all elected officals were voted on by the people for the people. This law that you signed into effect does discriminate by only effecting the lower class, I cannot go to my local pub enjoy a wide screen tv,have a beverage of my choice,SMOKE and relax.However if I had the money and were a member of a country club or any non-profit org I could. DO YOU SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE LAW ??? To me it is pure class discrimination. I would sure like to know how this was allowed to to become a law. I do await a responce.

Dear ETHOA Board, Mr. & Mrs. Brawley, Mr. Cooper, Governor Perdue and Mr. Sellers,

    Mr. and Mrs. Brawley, as you are the rightful owners with my Power of Attorney as your daughter who lives in my townhome, .....See the language my homeowner association attorney uses to abuse me as he writes below.  My answer to you Mr. Sellers is "No" Timothy.  I will not go to the trouble of paying for postage and driving to a post office which is out of my way and sending letters when....  It is written online at our website at <http://www.elizabethtownes.com>www.elizabethtownes.com, that "ALL" homeowners may communicate with the management company by email to <mailto:abaxter@hawthornemgmt.com>abaxter@hawthornemgmt.com as the authenticated email contact for answers to our questions or call her.  I have heretofore received responses from Ms. Angie Baxter Faulk at Hawthorne by email.  Why are you making problems for me now after this 12 percent increase in our HOA dues, which is above the 5 percent by law, when only 38 people out of 183 homeowners voted this in.  145 homeowners were against this raise in dues.  I have many responses from Ms. Faulk at Hawthorne Management heretofore Mr. Sellers.  I have kept copies of them.  Your language  is a direct abuse towards me in obvious unequal treatment as to other homeowners.  Note the language used below by our attorney to show huge bias and mistreatment of me for asking a legitimate question per directions from our website at <http://www.elizabethtownes.com>www.elizabethtownes.com to CONTACT ANGIE FAULK at <mailto:abaxter@hawthornemgmt.com>abaxter@hawthornemgmt.com or by calling 704-377-0114 , Ext. 217.  as to my right as a HOA paying homeowner to get a copy of our current budget after a 12 percent raise in homeowner dues. 

    Language from attorney Timothy Sellers is as follows which would create righteous indignation in any homeowner who has a right and a legitimate question :  NOTE:  as stated below......"neither the Association, its manager, its officers and directors, or my office will be responding to your "demands, threats, accusations or communications."  Response :  Mr. Sellers my question is not a demand, it is a right of any homeowner to ask for the budget and get a response from the legal and authenticated ways noted on our website.  It is not a "threat."  It is a right of any homeowner.  It is not an "accusation"...It is the right of any homeowner to receive timely responses per the directions online to ALL homeowners including me.  You mislead anyone reading this to insinuate that I am making problems when you know I am not and am asking questions that any homeowner should receive.  You are now cited as abusive towards me directly in this email communication. 

    NOTE THE NEXT LANGUAGE:  "There will be no responses to any telephone, verbal or email requests you may submit."  RESPONSE:  An outright statement denying me my rights to be answered as to other homeowners who do call in and make email requests per the directives online.   

    I am copying this email to our Attorney General and our Governor as I believe these good people will submit to me good faith as a citizen of North Carolina to receive my due rights as to correspondence as to the rights of ALL homeowners who pay you Timothy Sellers by our HOA dues and yield the board of directors the power to oversee our monies. 

    I am also by this writing submitting this to members of the North Carolina General Assembly to show this obvious abuse on me, copying this to another management company who does respond to their homeowners on time and to a media correspondent.    THERE IS NO EXCUSE WHATSOEVER FOR YOUR ABUSE OF ME THIS WAY.  IT IS UNCONSCIENABLE. 

    Sincerely,

    Jane Brawley Jordan

> Dear ETHOA Board,

>     Tell me straight out what the problem is in my not getting an answer to a very needed reply and simple answer as to what amount of the increase in homeowner's dues is going into cash reserves.  We are all busy, but this is no excuse for me to not get a response for 30 days now after my first request for the answer to this question emailed to you LaDonna on December 4, 2009.  What are you doing with the extra $8.69 after we pay out everything, with this new increase in HOA dues ?  I went to see both Pat Hedrick and James Cannon, tonight, in person, at Pat was not at home, and who, by law as other board members can easily answer this question.  What are you going to do with the extra amount in HOA dues as to how much will you put into cash reserves ?  I am going to state the truth.  Pat has chosen to "ignore me" after her renter came to the door and told me at first that she was not at home.  I left her a phone message.  And James Cannon had his girlfriend Jackie, that I really like, to come to the door for him as he was still in sight.  I cannot respect this.  He is a board member who is a man responsible and should talk to me.  He was standing within ten feet of me and hiding behind his girlfriend. I respect Jackie as she has always been nice to  me.  Jackie is a good person.  But so am I and I deserve even an answer from her as we are in the same boat, if she knows and lives with a board member.  Is it called friendly sharing.  She was very nice and even said she understood and then said I should contact LaDonna, when by law if she or James knows anything, as he is a board member, she or James should respond to me on anything they know.  I should not be sent in circles to find the answer to a simple question.  ALL PEOPLE THAT LIVE OUT HERE SHOULD BE FRIENDLY AND SHARING WITH EACH OTHER AS WE ARE DUE THIS WITH OUR  MONIES AND OTHER THINGS IN THIS ASSOCIATION.  You should be FRIENDLY to respond.  THERE IS NO PROBLEM UNLESS YOU MAKE IT ONE.  If you do not know, then tell me that.  But tell me something.   The October, November and December 2009 financials are missing from sight online on our website.  This would somewhat alarm any HOA paying homeowner. 

>  

>     I suppose Barbara Gillis has talked about me and given them the impression that I am harrassing them when the opposite is true.  You then cast the blame on me.  HOW DARE YOU ?  I know for a fact as others reported to me that a statement was made at the annual  meeting that "you had been harrassed."  I met with some others and explained to them what really happened about Barbara Gillis and they believed me and were indignified.  In fact they were furious.  NOW PEOPLE STOP IT.  IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.  IT DOESN'T.  YOU HOLD MY MONIES AND I CAN RECEIVE AN ANSWER FROM ANY ONE BOARD MEMBER BY LAW WHEN LADONNA NEVER ANSWERS ME.  I need an answer to my email first to you LaDonna.  If you are overloaded then please delegate responsibility.   If I do not get an answer from you, then of course any other board member can answer.  Our attorney knows this.  Do not turn this around on me when this is MY or MY PARENT'S MONEY and not respond.  That is not responsible or caring.  I just state the facts.  Has the budget for next year been set?  If so, please share this with me as a homeowner with Power of Attorney. How much have you decided will be put into cash reserves ?  MY PARENTS WANT TO KNOW THIS AS THEY ARE GETTING READY TO PAY THIS HUGE INCREASE IN HOA DUES AND THEY DESERVE AN ANSWER.  ALL OF US DESERVE SOME ANSWER EVEN IF IT IS THAT YOU DO  NOT KNOW YET.  TELL US SOMETHING.  I went online and there is nothing mentioned.  So I am forced to write you emails asking these just questions.

>  

>     LaDonna, I went to see both Pat Hedrick and James Cannon tonight to get an answer to a question that I emailed you twice on, being December 4, and December 17, 2009.  LaDonna, I have not received any type of answer yet and one is not posted online.  You are another homeowner.  How would you feel if you were not responded to at all when your dues, which includes you by the way, had gone up an extra $16.00 a month ?

>  

>     Let's make this a good year and communicate as caring responsible friendly sharing neighbors.   My door is open to anyone at any time.  I hope yours will be too.  I do not appreciate being ignored and mistreated like I am the problem, when you know full hand I have worked very hard to support our interests.  It is not fair, and I hope that you will choose to change this New Year and we will all choose to work together in a TIMELY WAY, so that things will improve.

Subject: What Obama Gave Us



What did Obama’s stimulus package get you?  I hope more than we were given with our own federal tax money and added debt.

As part of our stimulus package, seven intersections along a nearby state highway were “upgraded” for a combined contract total of something like (if my memory serves me correctly) $1.7 million. 

What did we get for that?  Well, just down the road is an intersection of two relatively minor state highways — an intersection that had already been widened and upgraded not that long ago.  But that wasn’t enough.  There is a big sign proudly giving credit to Obama for the most recent changes made. 

The money was spent on re-doing that intersection by cutting and changing the traffic islands for wheelchair ramps and putting in walk-don’t walk signs – making it all handicapped accessible.  That’s nice, and it sure looks good to government  types and do-gooders.   

So, what’s wrong with that?  Well, there are no sidewalks, no pathcarts, no trails…just no pedestrian access or need for such improvements at that intersection.  No one walks or rolls his wheelchair there.  It’s not accessible unless one has an all-terrain wheelchair!  And, there are no adjoining subdivisions or planned construction projects for that area.  It’s mostly farmland up and down the road.

For a wheelchair to get to the intersection, a handicapped person would have to drive to it.  Then, he would have to pull his wheelchair out of the van and circle around and around the intersection…and, that’s as far as he could go!

Thanks, Democrats and Obama.  That’s just what we needed to help our part of the world out of the recession.  We should now use more stimulus funds to build a traffic circle there and put up a monument to Obama right in the middle of it.   

Were you as lucky as us?

Dear Ms. Larson,

Please find attached an electronic copy of your October 9, 2009 email regarding "Non employee visitation on campus".

After speaking with my attorney regarding this email, it was brought to my attention that I should email you requesting that you publish a retraction email that does not specifically select me out. As this email is public record, the indications within with respect to my personal name can be deemed harassing and deformation of character.

Any and all personnel information should be kept classified and confidential. Therefor, by lue of this email a request is being made that you submit a retraction statement immediately with the subtraction of my name entirely.

Please release a retraction statement immediately and forward a copy to me.

Sincerely,

David Hose

The federal government said Wednesday it will take a majority ownership stake in the troubled auto lender GMAC, providing another $3.8 billion in aid to the company, which has been unable to raise from private investors the money it needs to staunch its losses.

The new aid package for GMAC, coming as most large banks are repaying the government, underscores both the problems afflicting the company and its importance to the Obama administration's efforts to revive the auto industry.

GMAC, which already has taken $12.5 billion in direct federal aid along with other forms of government support, is the largest lender to <http://financial.washingtonpost.com/custom/wpost/html-qcn.asp?dispnav=business&mwpage=qcn&symb=GM&nav=el>General Motors and Chrysler dealerships and to their auto-buying customers.

Subject: 12.09.09 Support Ares and Constellation

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: I am writing to ask for your support to help our nation remain a leader in human space exploration by ensuring NASA's Constellation Program is fully funded. As an American citizen who supports our country's aerospace workforce, I am concerned about the future of NASA. Our country is at a crossroads. We can commit fully to the Constellation human exploration program, or walk away from billions of dollars we've invested in the program over the past five years. Of even greater concern is this: In less than a year, the space shuttle will be retired and the United States will be left without access to the International Space Station. Instead we will be forced to rely on the Russians for transportation to space. Delaying or cancelling the Constellation program will not only increase our reliance on the Russians, but will signal to the world that the United States has willingly ceded its leadership position in space. Half a million Americans have dedicated their careers to our nation's goals of furthering science, technology, and education through human space exploration. They are committed to the success of human space exploration, but that dedication needs to be matched by a commitment from our elected leaders. Tens of thousands of jobs are at stake. A successful space exploration program will continue to create highly technical jobs, preserve a vital engineering industrial base that can be leveraged elsewhere in the U.S. economy. Investments in space exploration also create technology spinoff benefits that are leveraged in fields of medicine, science and agriculture. The Ares and Orion programs are the safest and most reliable means for pursuing the U.S. long-range space exploration goals. Additionally, these programs are the most fiscally responsible decision to make both in terms of investments to date and in cost effectiveness relative to the goal of long range space exploration. Our human spaceflight program is important to me and to our nation. I strongly urge you to ensure NASA's human space exploration initiatives are fully funded. Please share your support for a robust space exploration program with the President, and to NASA's oversight and appropriations committee chairs. Sincerely, William Bumgarner 665 N Main St Mocksville, NC 27028-2121

Ms. Charleston
It is now January 4th, 2010 and still no response from you or the Child Support office regarding my case and where we stand.  Please email regarding this and have your supervisor contact me.  I have sent numerous emails and left numerous messages on your voicemail with no response.  Is there a reason that I cannot get some response?  When was the last time that something has been done on this case?  When did Mr. Beecham get served with papers?
NO. COA01-698
NORTH CAROLINA COURT OF APPEALS
Filed: 6 August 2002
DONNA S. ISGETT,
Plaintiff-appellee,
v .                         Wake County
No. 99 CVD 11006
LENARD R. BEECHAM,
Defendant-appellant.

Appeal by defendant from order entered 6 February 2001 by Judge Kristin H. Ruth in Wake County District Court. Heard in the Court of Appeals 20 February 2002.
Elisabeth P. Clary, for plaintiff-appellee.

Webb & Webb, by John Webb, and Sally H. Sherer for defendant- appellant.

BRYANT, Judge.

Defendant appeals from the 6 February 2001 order of the trial court denying: 1) his motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and 2) his motion for summary judgment. For the reasons stated herein we dismiss this appeal as interlocutory.
On 9 May 1990, plaintiff Donna S. Isgett, a resident of Florence County, South Carolina, brought an action to establish paternity and child support for her minor child pursuant to the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act [URESA]. The action was forwarded to North Carolina for enforcement in Wake County as the putative father, Lenard R. Beecham [defendant], was a residentof Wake County. Defendant filed in Wake County District Court a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On 1 March 1991, the Wake County District Court granted defendant's motion and dismissed plaintiff's complaint with prejudice based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
On 16 August 1999, plaintiff filed a petition in Florence County under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act [UIFSA] for establishment of paternity, child support and medical coverage. On 21 January 2000, defendant, who was still residing in Wake County, filed in Wake County District Court motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted based on the doctrine of res judicata. Defendant also motioned for summary judgment based on res judicata. In an order entered 6 February 2001 the court denied defendant's motions. Defendant appealed.
Defendant presents three assignments of error. First, does res judicata bar an action brought under UIFSA by a plaintiff whose earlier action against the same defendant under URESA was dismissed with prejudice? Second, did the trial court err in failing to grant defendant's motions to dismiss and for summary judgment because the plaintiff sought the same relief that was denied in a prior action? Third, did the trial court err in making findings of fact not supported by the evidence and conclusions of law not supported by the facts or the law?    Our first and final determination is whether defendant appeals from an interlocutory order.
Generally, there is no right to appeal from an interlocutory order. "'An order or judgment is interlocutory if it is made during the pendency of an action and does not dispose of the case but requires further action by the trial court in order to finally determine the entire controversy.'" An appeal from an interlocutory order may be taken under two circumstances: 1) the order is final as to some but not all the parties and there is no just reason to delay the appeal; or 2) the order deprives the appellant of a substantial right that would be lost unless immediately reviewed.

Darroch v. Lea, ___ N.C. App. ___, ___, 563 S.E.2d 219, 221 (2002) (citations omitted). The denial of a motion for summary judgment is generally not immediately appealable because such denial does not affect a substantial right. Bockweg v. Anderson, 333 N.C. 486, 428 S.E.2d 157 (1993). However, "the denial of a motion for summary judgment based on the defense of res judicata may affect a substantial right, making the order immediately appealable." Id. at 491, 428 S.E.2d at 161. The doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, provides that "a final judgment on the merits in a prior action will prevent a second suit based on the same cause of action between the same parties or those in privity with them." Thomas M. McInnis & Assocs. v. Hall, 318 N.C. 421, 428, 349 S.E.2d 552, 556 (1986). A dismissal on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction is not on the merits; therefore, the doctrine of res judicata does not apply. Foreman v. Foreman, 144 N.C. App. 582, 586, 550 S.E.2d 792, 795, review denied, 354 N.C. 68, 553 S.E.2d 38 (2001).    In Foreman, the plaintiff-wife and defendant-husband were married in England. Upon their divorce in 1990, they entered into a British support order wherein, the husband was to pay £2,700 in annual spousal support. When the husband moved to North Carolina, the wife petitioned to enforce the British support order under URESA by registering it in Wake County in April 1995. In September 1995, the petition was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In June 1997, the wife again petitioned for enforcement of the British order in Wake County, this time under UIFSA. The trial court concluded that res judicata did not bar the wife's second claim under UIFSA as the case had not been adjudicated on the merits. This Court agreed, stating that "[w]hile this case involved the same cause of action and the same parties as a previous case (the initial 1995 Wake County petition), there had not been a final judgment in that previous case. There was a dismissal based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, which 'is not on the merits and thus is not given res judicata effect.'" Foreman, 144 N.C. App. at 586, 550 S.E.2d at 795.
In the case sub judice, defendant argues that this appeal is not from an interlocutory order because plaintiff's claim was previously dismissed with prejudice and therefore the doctrine of res judicata applies. However, the record reveals that plaintiff's previous claim did not involve a final judgment on the merits but was dismissed based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. As this Court stated in Foreman, res judicata does not apply to a dismissal on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Thus, the trial court correctly did not dismiss the case based on res judicata. All other issues on appeal are interlocutory and are dismissed. We therefore hold that this appeal is from an interlocutory order and is not properly before this Court.
DISMISSED.


Judges WALKER and HUNTER concur.

Why cant you answer me about any questions?  Do you not have my file?  If you had my file for about a year, then why was court date only set in March of this year if he was already in arrears over a year ago? If you did not attempt to serve him then why was a subpoena served and the deputy sherriff could not locate him and then it was taken off the court docket?  Where did the sherriff try to serve him? Should not this have been done before now?  When did you find out that he lived in Tennessee?  Do you not see in the court documents where he was living there at that time?  Why was a court date set if you did not serve Mr. Beecham something either by letter or subpoena?  Who has been in charge of my file before you since you have only had it a year?  Should this case have not been interstate from day one of the court ordering support?  The Judge knew he was in Tennessee, does my file not show that?

Please provide me with all the information that i have requested.  It is my RIGHT as a custodial parent to be able to get this information, especially since I was the one that gave you the new information on top of that.  After calling customer service the other week and they stated that they had no new information on Mr. Beecham, I gave them all his information of record and then emailed it to them.  When did you get this information?  Did they tell you then that I had called and requested that you email me again due to I have no phone.

Subject: NC Smoking Ban Concerns

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue, Now that the Smoking Ban has officially taken affect, my comments may be arriving too late. Either way, I still want to voice my opinions. I never believed this bill would actually be passed in North Carolina, "the tobacco state." I also believe in doing so the government is infringing on several civil rights. There is a difference between places open to the general public; such as post offices and court houses, where most people must go, and privately owned establishments open to the public; such as bars and restaurants, where people have a choice to go - i.e. PRIVATELY owned and the presence of a CHOICE. When you come into a bar that I own, you are in my building. You are my guest, you were not forced to come in, you were not forced to stay, and you didn't have to come. I have the right whether or not to invite you (provide you with a service/product) and you have the right whether or not to accept. Would it not be abuse of government to ban someone from smoking in their residential home? If someone came into my bar and did not enjoy my decorations, my furniture, my product choice, other patrons, or cigarette smoking, then they are free to leave and not return. I do not agree with exposing minors to smoke and that is why I do not allow anyone under the age of 21 in my bar. I do want to allow those of the legal age to engage in the legal act of smoking cigarettes. As a private business owner, I should be able to make that decision and the government has no right to say otherwise. You are impeding on my indivdual property rights and its dispicable. What's next Governor? What legal activities will we not be able to take part in in the future? What hypocracies will you force on us next? I look forward to your response. Extremely Concerned Citizen and Business Owner, Catherine Rudder

Dear Rep. Brad Miller



Reigning in Wall Street.



No it is big Socialist government interfering with freedom.



Are you proposing replacing the failed Barney Franks oversight committee?  The government forcing banks, Fannie May and Freddy Mac to loan money to people that could never pay it back is the cause of this recession.  If you would let capitalism work we would not be in the mess you have created.



Is this another oversight committee that will cause another recession?  Get the government out of our lives and let the greatest country in history be looked up to by the world again.  Keep growing the Socialist/Communist government and we will be worse off than France.



Remember you are up for reelection in 2010.

Subject: 12.09.09 Support Ares and Constellation

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: I am writing to ask for your support to help our nation remain a leader in human space exploration by ensuring NASA's Constellation Program is fully funded. As an American citizen who supports our country's aerospace workforce, I am concerned about the future of NASA. Our country is at a crossroads. We can commit fully to the Constellation human exploration program, or walk away from billions of dollars we've invested in the program over the past five years. Of even greater concern is this: In less than a year, the space shuttle will be retired and the United States will be left without access to the International Space Station. Instead we will be forced to rely on the Russians for transportation to space. Delaying or cancelling the Constellation program will not only increase our reliance on the Russians, but will signal to the world that the United States has willingly ceded its leadership position in space. Half a million Americans have dedicated their careers to our nation's goals of furthering science, technology, and education through human space exploration. They are committed to the success of human space exploration, but that dedication needs to be matched by a commitment from our elected leaders. Tens of thousands of jobs are at stake. A successful space exploration program will continue to create highly technical jobs, preserve a vital engineering industrial base that can be leveraged elsewhere in the U.S. economy. Investments in space exploration also create technology spinoff benefits that are leveraged in fields of medicine, science and agriculture. The Ares and Orion programs are the safest and most reliable means for pursuing the U.S. long-range space exploration goals. Additionally, these programs are the most fiscally responsible decision to make both in terms of investments to date and in cost effectiveness relative to the goal of long range space exploration. Our human spaceflight program is important to me and to our nation. I strongly urge you to ensure NASA's human space exploration initiatives are fully funded. Please share your support for a robust space exploration program with the President, and to NASA's oversight and appropriations committee chairs. Sincerely, Thomas Russell 4531 Lanstone Ct SW Concord, NC 28027-8704

Dear Governor Perdue,

My name is Phil Savage, I'm from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Last summer I had the pleasure to spend 10 weeks in the beautiful state of North Carolina as I was a volunteer assistant baseball coach with the Forest City Owls of the Coastal Plain collegiate summer league. Hopefully you heard about the success we had last summer as we went 51-9 (winning the CPL championship) and were the #1 team in the country.

While in North Carolina, I was able to visit cities such as Gastonia, Asheboro, Thomasville, Fayetteville, Edenton, Outer Banks, Wilmington and Charlotte. Apart from the 90 degree heat all summer, I very much enjoyed my stay in North Carolina and will definitely come back to visit some of the friends I made last summer.

Sincerely,

Phil Savage

Subject: Smoke-Free NC

Comment: I am a smoker, which makes me a second class citizen.I do and always have respect the right of non-smokers. But to put us out in all kind of weather, rain,snow,sleet,etc....has gone too far. I work at Wal-Mart, which at the time I applied for a job, had a break room in the very back of the store for smokers. No one need go in the room or pass by unless they "wanted" to. The room was not in any way for public use, the only people affected by it, was in fact the smokers, which was fine. Now, we no longer have our break room, or any other rights as far as that goes....the taxes we pay on our smoking brings in huge revenue....once you get the smokers stopped...how will you replace it ? I am unsure as to how this law was executited...was it you the governor, or who ? I am a proud democrat, that did vote for you, but if you are the one that passed this, then I for sure will not vote for you in the future. Our smoking room for employees did not hurt anyone but ourselves. And now we have to say in the matter, we're just put out in the cold, no shelter,no comfort, no nothing, but a bucket of cat litter.!! We smokers respect the rights of others, why can't anyone respect our rights ? But that is a joke isn't it ? We don't have ANY rights. I am very disappointed. I will not vote for you again, I wish I could take my vote back. Sincerely, Renee Haas Smoker

I really didn't ask any questions, or want anything of our new dictator, that I helped to vote into office...I simply made a comment.  The thing is, I have been a democrat all my life and I actually believed that Bev Perdue would make a good Governor for NC, but the first thing she did was prove that she had the power to control..by revoking the rights of person's who choose to smoke...I think there are many other problems with this state and country than focusing on us smokers...Governor Perdue might have gotten my vote this last time, but I would vote for a republican (which I have never done before), before I would ever give my vote to her again.  I might be getting old and not in good health but is there anymore of our rights that she wants to revoke?  My father fought in World War II for the freedom of this country and was proud of his service, just like two of my uncles and my middle son...but I'm glad they can't see what they truly fought for!  They thought they were fighting for our freedom when in reality they were fighting for person's of wealth to make all the rules and take our freedom away, or limit it.  When is Governor Perdue going to allow same sex marriages?  That will be her next move, right?  Anything for another vote, that is how it works isn't it?  I am almost ashamed to even allow others to know that I am a democrat, when once I was expelled from high school because a republican made an abusive remark about JFK and I punched him in the nose, for that I was expelled for a week.  What the heck, I definitely have nothing to defend about our current politicians, nor would I.

I grew up in a home where my mother was a very devoted democrat as was all her family, but my father a republican thus many disagreements around my house around election day.  My mother refused to ever change her way of thinking and my father as strong in his beliefs.  I was closer to my mother's family and in fact have a first cousin who holds a very political position in Yancey County, I have always defended the beliefs and ways of the liberal party but I am beginning to believe that just possibly I followed the beliefs of the wrong parent.  I now thing the republicans have become what the democrat party used to be, honest upright person's who do believe in right and wrong...unlike our present rule maker!

Recession-Resistant Growth: Location Intelligence Firm Announces the ‘9 from 2009’ 

Gadberry Group names the nine most notable high-growth areas in the nation from 2009


LITTLE ROCK, AR – January 5, 2010 – <http://www.gadberry.net/GG%209from2009.cfm>Gadberry Group today announced its list of last year’s nine most notable high-growth areas in the US – Gadberry Group’s 9 from 2009.


Gadberry Group’s 9 from 2009
* Braselton, Georgia (Atlanta suburb)
* Atascocita, Texas (Houston suburb)
* Spring Hill, Tennessee (Nashville suburb)
* Lincoln, California (Sacramento suburb)
* Katy, Texas (Houston suburb)
* Wake Forest, North Carolina (in the Raleigh-Durham triangle)
* Mansfield, Texas (Dallas suburb)
* Wylie, Texas (Dallas suburb)
* Buckeye, Arizona (Phoenix suburb)

“Compiling the 2009 list was especially interesting as we anticipated the impact of current economic conditions,” said Gadberry Group principal Larry Martin. Headquartered in Little Rock, Gadberry Group provides location intelligence services and data for the world’s top retail brands.

This year’s list averaged household growth of 170% from 2000 to 2009, compared to last year’s list average of 267% for the same period. Martin noted that, in light of current economic challenges, the 2009 list might well include the most resilient areas featured yet.     

Texas appears to be bucking national economic trends, capturing four of this year’s nine slots. Industry research indicates that a comparatively stable housing market is likely a contributing factor.

According to Martin, most researchers agree that Census data has been the standard for understanding the distribution and demographic makeup of the U.S. population. “But Census data is more than nine years old, so changes in demographic characteristics can’t be identified or measured accurately using only Census-based estimates,” he added. 

The firm uses proprietary products to employ a statistical ranking system that evaluates the 17,000 Census Places. Selection criteria and ranking methodology include percent change, absolute change and emerging Census blocks (those growing from less than 10 households in Census 2000 to over 100 in 2009). The analysis considers total growth from 2000 to 2009, as well as that from 2008 to 2009. Gadberry also weights the analysis using key demographic variables such as ethnicity, household income, net worth, economic stability, length of residence and age. 

“The number-one spot went to Braselton, Georgia, whose impressive household growth was only surpassed by its economic strength,” Martin said. “Braselton topped the list with an average household income increase of 67% from 2000 to 2009.”

Many of this year’s finalists repeatedly make the top 25, including: Lehi, UT; Indian Trail, NC; Queen Creek, AZ; Summerlin, NV; Helotes, TX; Frisco, TX; Goodyear, AZ; Brighton, CO; McKinney, TX; Wentzville, MO; Enterprise, NV; and Bluffton, SC. 

By the Numbers – 9 from 2009: Wake Forest, North Carolina (see links above for data on other Places)  
Wake Forest is located northeast of Raleigh and was recognized by Forbes magazine in 2007 as the 20th fastest growing suburb in the US. Wake Forest grew from 8,150 households in 2000 to 17,803 in 2009, or 118%. Wake Forest had 13 Emerging Blocks, the second highest in the group. 

Along with Mansfield, Wake Forest saw an overall decrease in median age, dropping from 34.5 in 2000 to 34.1. Average household income for Wake Forest increased from $70,148 to $82,771.  
“As a Wake Forest native, I’ve recognized the explosive growth that our community has experienced. The Gadberry data will give us the quantitative tools we need to continue to draw new development to Wake Forest,” said Don Stroud, Wake Forest Area Chamber of Commerce Board Co-Chair.

”The trouble with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.” - Margaret Thatcher  (“Wants” become “Needs” then “Rights” & exceed any tax-ability to pay for them.)

"You cannot legislate the poor into freedom by legislating the wealthy out of freedom. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving. The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.

“When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that my dear friend, is about the end of any nation. You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it."  -- Dr. Adrian Rogers (1931-2005)

Comment: Regarding the NC smoking ban. I would like to register my concerns regarding the policy. While it is difficult to defend smoking, it seems like it should be easy to defend the RIGHT to smoke. I thought the whole concept of our democracy was freedom of choice. Non-smokers had a choice before the bill was enacted, but smoker's now have NO choice - and this coming from the State of North Carolina!

Subject: The Smoking Ban

Comment: I am appalled that you would sign such trash into legislation! North Carolina is a tobacco state! All of my family has raised tobacco! You are taking money out of people's pockets! Can you reverse the legislation? I am hoping that every bar and restaraunt that adheres to this smoking ban suffers from lack of business. A lot of customers are smokers! Smokers desever the right to smoke indoors as well. I dont see a problem with people smoking indoors as long as there are dividers dividing smoking from non smoking. I hope these people who passed this legislation choke on their fresh air!

Subject: Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act

Comment: Dear Governor: As your constituent, I am writing this letter to urge you and your appropriate state agencies to act swiftly to implement the state requirements under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. Although the Adam Walsh Act provided that states have three years to comply with the requirements, delay in implementing these changes will jeopardize the safety of children and the community. Law enforcement needs the resources to protect children and communities from the scourge of convicted sex offenders: I urge you to fully implement all the state mandates within the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. I am particularly concerned about the following: 1. To implement an effective and comprehensive mechanism to verify the residence of the most high risk sex offenders at least once every three months. 2. To collect DNA samples from sex offenders who have not already provided them to local law enforcement. 3. To complete fingerprint-based background checks on all foster and adoptive placements to ensure that foster children are placed in safe homes. Citizens need access to accurate and timely information regarding convicted sex offenders living in their community. The 50 states and the federal government are responsible for building and maintaining an effective national sex offender database. A national sex offender database is a critical safeguard to protect Americaâ€™s children and with each passing day that the provisions of this law are not implemented, the danger to children is heightened. The states are at the forefront to provide reliable information about the identity and whereabouts of convicted sex offenders. That information needs to be accessible, accurate and verifiable, or our communities are at grave risk. I strongly urge you to act now to implement the state-directed mandates passed in the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act so that our children are kept safe from these dangerous predators and law enforcement has the necessary investigative resources. Thank you for your attention to this urgent request. Sincerely, Cindy Michel

Comment: Dear Governor, I am writing to ask you to stand behind Senate Bill 1738, Protect our Children Act. There is probably nothing i can tell you that you do not already know about this Bill. I just want to be one more voice asking that you speak for every parent, child and grandparent in North Carolina. This bill is long overdue. Saving this planet is useless if there is no one to save it for! Thank you, Ann Walsh

You were asking for money saving ideas- how about cutting out the WIC ready made formula for infants unless it is necessary in certain circumstances. I have 2 children and bought the premade once otherwise it was too dear. Buy some water or use it from a tap and mix- easy, peasy. Jonathan Paris

Happy New Year! 

Happy New Year, North Carolina!  I hope 2010 is a wonderful time for you and your family!
The year gone by was certainly tough for many. 
The economy squeezed budgets from the kitchen table to the halls of state government.  We all faced challenges - and there will be more to come - but as North Carolinians are so apt to do, we turned challenges into opportunities.
With the dawn of a New Year, we have time to pause, reflect and dream of what's to come.  Our New Year's resolutions can be bold.  We have a chance to turn things around. 
Dream big, because anything is possible in the New Year!

Dear Ms. Tully,



I will take your advise, by informing Mr. Willougby and hopefully you will be right regarding his character.  So via this e-mail as to what the hard evidence shows, contained within ADA files, and e-mails, case dispositions, and superior court transcripts in connection with a civil process in Family court.  To add insult to injury in my case that STATE got WCHS to obtain a civil injunction, after it was discovered that crimes were being committed by STATE actors, and officers of the court in the abusive civil process.



Plus to top of it all, I have a tape recording of a county attorney admitting to these crimes, and conspiring whit a social worker to perpetrate a fraud upon the court in Hampton Va, and N.C. In addition to this same Social Worker on tape stating there was no need to have removed my daughter in the first place that I am sending to the both  DA Mr. Willoughby via U.S. Mail  DOJ Ms Tully.



What they did in defrauding the Commonwealth of Virginia was by intentional and malicious obstruction of justice in not promptly alerting the N.C court to contact the VA court. Where as in Wake County N.C. the County Attorney controls, and drafts all of the orders of the court, instead of the judge performing his judicial function of writing his own orders.  So in this case the criminal and proprietor is policing himself, as well as, concealing and conspiring to conceal any illegal activities that his client Wake County Human Services commits. That this same county attorney has been reprimanded by the N.C. State Bar for fraud upon the Durham N.C. family courts, and was forced to leave Durham County family court as a result, and would up in the Wake County Family Courts continuing the same underhanded, mischievous, and fraudulent patters of abuse, and fraud upon the court. The N.C. Bar reprimand is public record on Albert J Singer.



1.       The DA, and Social Worker filed a false petition of removal on October 2nd 2007 under a false pretext, so as to institute a civil prosecution on behalf of the STATE of N.C., without the Social Worker conducting any investigation. Lying to the magistrate in N.C. stating we were residents of N.C. when in fact we moved early in the year to AZ, and were in the process of closing down the Cary investment property that had been foreclosed upon one Day before the DA and Social Worker filed to bogus petition on October 2nd 2007, because the S.W. had illegally violated the Federal Education Rights privacy ACT at Kingwood elementary in Cary N.C., and obtained something that the STATE needed to prosecute on.

2.       The DA in N.C. placed me under an excessive bond in October 2007 holding me down in violation of the U.S. Constitution “excessive bond”, that did not fit the alleged charge, and then discovered that the VA court had previously issued a child custody order, which would undermine the STATE ability to proceed as planned to use the bogus Civil Juvenile action to unlawfully and bogusly prosecute and obtain unlawfully confidential information.



3.       So Meanwhile the STATE, and the Civil actors pretended that the Hampton Va. order did not exist, where the law states pursuant to the full faith and credit clauses of the U.S. Constitution, and the federal requirement of the Uniformed Child Custody Jurisdiction Enforcement Act, and the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act. That the STATE COURT of North Carolina must immediately without delay contact the STATE who issued the original child custody decree before preceding any further in any civil action within the STATE where the child is located.





4.       Instead of complying with the U.S. Constitution, UCCJEA, and PKPA. N.C. and the STATE and Civil actor, whom have obtained a copy of the Va Custody order from searching the Cary N.C. investment property on or about October 6th 2007 unlawfully conceal the Va Custody orders existence, and pretend it doesn’t exist. Where the Wake County Attorney Al Singer, GAL advocate Attorney Hal Morris, and Mother attorney Sydney J Batch draft a fraudulent and forged Court order on October 9th, 2007 as a fining of fact # 16 then “no custody order exist in any other state”. When in fact it did and the Wake County Social Worker made the mistake of faxing a copy of the VA Custody order to the clerk in Hampton Va. at 8:08 am on October 9th 2007 prior to the October 9th 2007 hearing in N.C. where this same Social Worker was present in open court telling Judge Bousman, along with the officer of the court that the Va. Custody order did not exist.



5.       Then the VA clerk of court validates the N.C. Social workers request for verification of the Va Custody order of 2001, and provides the N.C. social worker a copy of the JDR file from 2001. Prior to the November 13th 2007 up and coming hearing in N.C. and by this time all of the officers of the N.C. juvenile court know of existence of the VA custody order, and intentionally set out to defraud the commonwealth of Virginia, and circumvent the UCCJEA, PKPA, Commit acts of treason against the U.S. constitution, in violation of their oats of office to up hold the law. And as a requirement to practice in Wake County Family court, the court officers and social worker 1st receive training on the law in relations to custody orders that exist in other states as mandated or you’re ineligible to act in Wake County Family Court. As the Social Worker Danielle Doyle, while I’m still being held under this  excessive bail by the STATE, whom the Social Worker is conspiring with ADA Melanie Shekita anyway prior to and actions being commenced in October 2007. Makes the Mistake of faxing the Va clerks validation  of the existence of the VA custody order to County Attorney Albert Singer prior to the November 13th 2007 hearing.

6.       Then the November 13th 2007 hearing comes and Judge Monica Bousman get reassigned and this Juvenile case gets assigned to Judge Eric Chasse and against another order is drafted by Al Singer and officers of the court with no mention or recognition of the Va. Custody order existing again for the second time. Where as the officers of the court are now maliciously staging, and coloring the orders of the N.C. courts in a false light, to buy time for Nancy Berson, who was acting as an agent for the STATE to violate attorney client privilege and conduct an illegal criminal investigation on behalf the STATE under the false pretext of a child and family evaluation. Where this STATE actor had conspired with the STATE ADA M. Shekita, and CPD M. Savage, and County Attorney Albert Singer in secrete by this time the to unconstitutionally circumvent {“best interest of the child standard” the federal mandates to contact Va Court,  14th amendment to the U.S. constituting, and full faith and credit clause of the articles of the U.S. Constitution  have been, willfully, wantonly, reckless, maliciously, and  unlawfully compromised and violated}.

7.       During this unconstitutional delay of close to 90 days, my second lawyer David Duke gets’ cold feet and withdraw for no reason. In the meantime Berson, is frantically and over zealously trying to stage and conduct the criminal investigation for ADA Melanie Shekita pending criminal allegation that, was eventually dismissed by the way, where Berson is having a tizzy fit because she can’t get to interrogate my wife, and take advantage of my wife language barrier under the false pretext of a non-criminal civil investigation trying to stage the criminal prosecution. So Berson at the demands of Shekita, Singer, Batch, and Morris, writes fraudulent account of event, disguised as a child and family evaluation knowing just how this process works, and what verbiage to use to maliciously label one parent in favor of the outer, outrage the female sex against the mail sex, falsely depict the minor child as fragile distraught. {It would stand to reason that minor child would have exhibited this concocted PTSD condition at the school in the prior years to October 2007, and there after. That the minor child doctors, dentist, pediatricians, and optometrists whom were regularly treating the minor child since birth till the STATE intervention in October 2007 would have pickup of on a condition of PTSD or the minor child being in fear of her father, who was sometimes taking the minor child to this doctors, when the stepmother was unable too take our daughter to these doctors herself” Again only the criminals and perpetrator get to diagnose my daughter with their selective therapist and Doctors on their medicate payroll, and under contract exclusively for WCHS-CPS. I wonder if WCHS-CPS would still use these sources if by chance they went against WCHS or did not support each others finding as friends in the pre-selected selected WCHS contractors profession that are in their pockets. Case in point WCHS waited till a year later to send by daughter to a doctors, and psychologist after Berson completed the fallacy CFE in December 2007 that was used poisoning of the well piece of propaganda.

8.       At this stage the my daughter of six years get exploited by Nancy Berson, and subjected to psychological ploys. Where they shift the reality of what my daughter is really saying according to the WCHS files, “That she saw noting and wishes to go home” to the fallacy and rhetoric of Nancy Berson deceptive version of the facts. Now the STATE and wake County have removed themselves and placed the hearsay earnest upon a therapies working as an agent for the STATE. Meanwhile my daughter is being subject to sibling rivalry in her current unauthorized foster care with Sandricka Williams, and being abused in her foster care placement.

9.       All the time the officer of the wake county family court, and the STATE ADA Melanie A Shekita now that by law the social worker D. Doyle contacting the Va clerk of JDR Court doesn’t satisfy the legal requirement that the N.C. court must establish contact with the Virginia Court “judge to judge contact must be made” to satisfy federal law. And that two requirements must be determined.

a.       Whether the Va. court still has continued excusive jurisdiction. Which the Va court found it had six months after the fact in March 2008

b.      Whether the Va court is a convenient forum. Which the VA court found it was an inconvenient forum due to the six months intentional delay, and reliance on the forged, fraudulent, and misleading information sent by the STATE of N.C. to the JDR Court in VA. Where Singer obstructed justice and deceived the VA GAL by claiming my daughter bonded with her foster mom, and therapist in N.C., and that all the witnesses were located in N.C., when in fact there were not witness!!!!

To Satisfy these two federal requirements the court determine:

a.       The Va court has to determine the Home State of the child, and the length of time the child has been away from the home state. In this case it would have only been a couple of days if N.C. had followed the law in October 2007

b.      If Domestic violence is an issue. In this case D.V. would not be an issue of ADA M. Shekita had not violated my right to a speeding trial with the alleged 2006 D.V case, where she could not establish jurisdiction or that it actually happen that was eventually dismissed in 2008. And the false 2007 D.V. that was malicious instituted, and dismissed in December 2007, without trial.

a.       And the circumstances surrounding the child. In this case where Singer intentional created fraudulent and misleading orders of the N.C. court, and bogus CFE that Singer without permission or Authority and unlawfully transmitted by fax to Judge Stilts the former GAL at the time in Hampton. Used to trick and deceived Ms. Stiths, as the WCHS internal files and records show something totally different going on. Then Judge Chasse committees a contempt of court by intentionally, maliciously misleading Judge Durden and not sending all of the pleading of every party as Orders to by Chief Justice Robert Radar court order to Virginia, as Chasse in secret discarded the pleading of Mr. and Ms. Davis filed with the N.C. to be sent to the Va. court, and only sent the orders written and drafted by Wake county Attorney Albert J Singer, Hal Morris, and Sydney J Batch instead. The communications by Chasse and singer did not occur till March of 2008 six months after the fact of the existence of the Va Custody order.

10.   Now December 2007 comes, and I fire my criminal lawyer and tell Wake county Superior court Judge Donald Jacobs how ADA M. Shekita has been engaging in prosecutorial misconduct regarding my excessive bond.  Where Judge Jacobs reduces my bond from $100.00.00 to the appropriate bond of $10.000.00 where I immediately post bond, and get out of jail. And by this time the wheels are in motion to defraud the VA courts, as they gone to far, hoping that I would not make bail, and that the STATE could follow through with it plan to prosecute me within the 90day mandatory adjudication time frame to adjudicate  cases in Wake County Family court.

11.   Now at this stage I’m green to the law, UCCJEA, FERPA, PKPA, N.C.G.S 50(a) N.C.G.S 7(b) Va code 20, U.S constitution, Title 42 U.S.C, and unbeknownst to me or my wife the STATE ADA M. Shekita and CPD officer M. Savage had turned over the STATE entire criminal discovery for prosecution to Al Singer, Sydney Batch and Hal Morris to prosecute me in this civil action instituted by the STATE. unbeknownst to me My daughter was being abused and was clearly communicating that she saw noting and waned to go home.  unbeknownst to me My daughters therapist Peggy Wallace initially diagnosed my daughter with separation anxiety disorder, and adjustment disorder. But instead of the wake county civil servants and officers of the court, and the court coming clean they chose to continue with the STATE wishes, and pull off a con-game confidence sham upon me at this time. unbeknownst to me the Crack head Mother and her attorney Sydney Batch were saying I took my daughter without the Crack Head mother permission even  though there was a VA custody order that the mother knew about, and the mother gave me written permission in her own handwriting while living in Belgium to have custody. Including the fact the mother made no legitimate efforts to show up and be in her daughter life for over six years. unbeknownst to me WCHS, GAL and Sydney Batch had promised the mother that she would regain legal custody of my daughter via the N.C courts. Where then the N.C. court in secret suddenly contacted the Va court in late December 2007 after my release from custody in late December 2007, and had an undocumented  ex-parte communication with the VA Court. where Judge Durden initially wrote back to the N.C. court that based upon this secret communication that he was disinclined to exercise jurisdiction, where the N.C. Court and lied to Judge Durden alluding that my daughter and I had not been in the Commonwealth of Va for over five years, and we resided in N.C. for the past five years.  Which is totally false as we lived in Belgium from 2001 till late 2004, and did not return from Belgium to Cary N.C. as fraudulent stated in the WCHS Petition of October 2nd 2007, and false CPD report written by CPD officer M. Savage as both sides of  the N.C. investment property was leased out to tenants in 2004-2005.

12.   So from October 2nd 2007 till March 2008, Chasse, Singer, Morris, Batch, and ADA M. Shekita conspire amongst themselves to circumvent the Va custody order, defraud the Va Courts and the Va parties. While the STATE was unlawfully obtain confidential information building a case to try to maliciously prosecute me. While WCHS, GAL, the Court and Attorney were running a sham of inflamed false air of my daughter being in fear of me, and destroying our bond. Trying to pit my wife’s love for my daughter against my daughter to criminally prosecute me, and vexatiously keep me away from my daughter to keep this fallacy of fear going for over two years now knowing that my daughter was not in fear and love me and missed me which would have dispelled the fear factor, and deflated the entire civil action and exposed it for what it really was a fraud.

13.   To add insult to injury Al Singer had Wake County Child support, serve me with child support order in January 2008, while I was on public assistance, disable, and unemployed. While the mother was sitting next to me gainfully employed at AT&T in Texas and not served.  Where Wake County Human Services had used Tax payer money to fly the Mother from Texas to N.C. so that N.C. could exercise personal jurisdiction over her to appear in court, and never pay a dime in child-support over the past two years. While I was excessively imposed with an imputed child support payments and unemployed. Singer was maliciously again attempting to place road blocks in the Va courts way, and exercise personal jurisdiction over me by any means necessary, where the civil Servants in Child Support court were also sharing confidential information with  the STATE ADA M. Shekita to attempt to criminally prosecute me in that non-criminal civil action behind my back on account of race and gender.

14.   One would think that a citizen of the united states is entitled to equal protection under the law, and attempting to railroad a citizen based upon their race, and sex have long since pasted. In addition to the fact that the STATE of N.C, and the Civil servants also violated a Domestic Violent Protective order issued by the commonwealth of Virginia city of Hampton in 2008 to protect my daughter from the mother. Where the STATE and the Civil Servants again denied full faith and credit to that Va. DVPO order also.



This initiative by the STATE of N.C was intended to facilitate the unlawful sharing of information between civil CPS and criminal investigators Melanie Shekita and Danielle Doyle respectively. In practice, it has only increased the risk of the abusive parallel civil and criminal enforcement actions and fraud upon the court that took place in the in North Carolina on account of bad faith, then crossing state lines into Hampton Virginia. when it was discovered by surprise by the STATE that VA had issued a custody order on the minor child in 2001., Then the STATE of N.C.  commissioned Wake County Human Services to defraud the Va court and parties in Va in secrete, for the sole purpose of  malicious prosecution by ADA M. Shekita and CPD M. Savage instituting a bogus civil action in bad faith using the minor child as the pawn and the bait.



According to the only officer on the at the scene pertaining to the alleged July 2007, giving rise to the Juvenile Civil action A Cary Police officer by the Name of just recently come forth and Police officer William Saunders has Cleary state’s that in fact the my daughter was not present nor was she accounted for on the Date in questioning in July 2007 in fact my daughter was visiting a relative on this date and time in question.



Any one can call Cary police officer William Saunders and he will tell you that my daughter was not present or accounted for during the alleged July 2007 false D.V allegation, and that he was the only responding officer that he initially found no Domestic Violence to have occurred, and left the scene, that he was cut off by his supervisor down the block, and around the corner, and forced to go back and file the D.V charge anyway. According to the Police Report M. Savage had overheard the call on the CPD radio, and maliciously seized the false opportunity to carryout the STATES plan, and failed attempt of 2006 to use and abuse a civil process under false pretext to attempt prosecute in BAD FAITH



That the STATE attempted this outrageous and unlawful tactic in 2006, but the Wake county Human Services Social worked Wanda Turner refused to be a party to this and denied the false claim filed by CPD officer Michelle Savage.

Yet Savage in conjunction with Shekita filed another false CPS report again in 2007 in re the July 2007 alleged incident that was dismissed without taking it to trail by ADA Shekita., as the STATE had achieved it malicious goal in institution a bogus civil process in bad faith for criminal intent to prosecute the alleged 2006 case that was eventually dismissed in my favor.



Where the STATE was unable to substantiated a false allegation of D.V. or jurisdiction of  2006 case, in which ADA Shekita disobeyed a superior court judge Donald Jacobs, in depriving me of a speedy trial. In that ADA Shekita kept this case open for over 2 years after it was ripe within 30 days back in 2006 so that she could institute an abusive parallel civil and criminal process in BAD FAITH. Where she give this criminal case the Social Worker of Wake County human Services in the civil matter to prosecute me by, as scattered all through the notes, records, and reports of CPD, WCHS, and GAL internal records.





The federal Government has cautioned its investigators, however, that once criminal charges are filed, the civil enforcement agents should stop sharing information with the criminal investigators, but in this instance the allege criminal charges were already filed, Where as DA maliciously instituted the Civil matter causing my daughter to suffer, and loose her parent and relative of African American Decent due to racial, and gender based profiling under the color of law by the STATE. Which was totally being controlled and manipulated in the background by ADA M. Shekita unlawfully infringing upon my daughter constitutional rights, and or familial rights via a false light being shed by County Attorney Albert  J. Singer.



Due to the fact that ADA M. Shekita and her co-conspirator CPD Michelle Savage not being properly trained in ethnic diversity of French/Algerian culture, or Post traumatic Stress Disorder which my wife had suffered from since age 10 through 2005, 2006, 2007 and where my wife was being treated by a Doctor for such PSTD at the time by prescribed medication.



Instead the DA and CPD were negligent and made malicious assumption of D.V. without cause, and abused my daughter in the process. Ironically the civil agency abusing the legal processes and confidentially laws, was paying for my wife’s therapy and conditions of PSTD in 2006.



And instead of properly investigating the matter, the Civil Agency put on a Fraud and went along with ADA Melanie Shekita abusing a non-criminal civil process.  However, the information gleaned from the civil juvenile proceedings was shared with criminal prosecutors in "Bad faith" basis as the  undertaking of an civil investigation that was "objectively unreasonable,", as there was no child there in the first place. By report the minor child kept saying she saw noting, and wished to go back home to Mr. and Ms. Davis and that the civil investigators were hell-bent on prosecuting, where as the civil juvenile case was only for  pretext for building a criminal case against me to prosecute the alleged 2006, and 2007 matters.



In my case as a parent I was maliciously forced to defend myself simultaneously on several fronts, responding to regulatory civil Juvenile enforcement actions in family court, and child support court, civil lawsuits, and criminal investigations that were dismissed for the same alleged misconduct on account of the STATE infringement, and due to my race, color, and sex.



The growing prevalence of parallel investigations has significantly increased the risk that the constitutional rights of parents in Family courts of Wake County and their children will be violated, and orders of another state to be unlawfully circumvented. Overly zealous prosecutors ADA Melanie Shekita often abuse their discretion by either bringing civil proceedings while criminal charges are pending. More sinister, however, in my case is the practice of initiating juvenile civil proceedings as a pretext for obtaining incriminating evidence for use in a subsequent criminal prosecution where the civil process hinges all upon hearsay, and an inability to validate the integrity of the process..Where ADA Melanie Shekita had the Social Workers, and officers of the court place the parent under duress, in that the only way the Parent is to regain custody of my daughter was to admit the alleged criminal charges that never took place, that were being sought by the STATE ADA Melanie Shekita in the background.



In my scenario, investigators from Wake County Human Service  lull their targets ( the judges, and GAL in Hampton Va) into thinking that the matter is being investigated only as a civil matter. In these circumstances, serious public policy and constitutional issues are raised under the Double Jeopardy, Self Incrimination, Equal Protection, and Due Process Clauses.



Indeed, in several recent cases discussed herein, courts have barred prosecutors from using testimony provided by the defendant in the related civil proceeding. Except in my cases, the courts did not gone so far as to dismiss the indictments altogether for serious prosecutorial misconduct, including deceit, trickery and fraud. That actually took place by the official paper trail left behind by ADA Melanie Shekita prosecutorial misconduct in the background of my case, and the fraud upon the VA. Courts that was committed.



Unfortunately in the Wake County Family Court, and WCHS, there is a growing trend to use parallel civil and criminal prosecutions by the STATE upon unsuspecting parents, and their kids. This abusive practice should be curtailed by the Department of Justice, STATE Attorney Generals office, and other law enforcement agencies. Moreover, courts should provide closer scrutiny and impose appropriate sanctions to deter this practice, and not tolerate courts of another state abusing process within a sister state without providing full disclosure.



Supreme Court Rulings. As noted, parallel and successive civil and criminal prosecutions raise self-incrimination, double

jeopardy and other related due process and constitutional questions. In United States v. Kordel, 397 U.S. 1 (1970), But if the civil proceeding was brought solely to obtain information for a criminal investigation as it was in my case, or if the government attorney fails to notify the civil target that he is also a criminal target, then the right against self-incrimination is violated.



While remaining silent in a criminal investigation cannot be used against a defendant, the same is not true in a civil proceeding that was instituted by ADA Melanie A Shekita. Asserting one's right to remain silent in a civil proceeding can be construed against the parents; hence, a civil target may be pressured to cooperate with government attorneys if they believe that no criminal proceedings are underway or likely to occur. Where I was deceived into Stipulating in the Civil matter after being placed under duress. “In my case one would argued that the civil fines were so excessive {admit to a crime that you did not do} or {Never see your child again} that they constituted a second punishment for the same offense, and hence, were barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.



In which the ADA Melanie Shekita just recently prosecute a case base upon Race, Color, and Sex. In that ADA Shekita kept placing the alleged white female whom is my wife alleged criminal case to be only tried after the Black Males trial when in fact ADA Shekita intentionally set the Black Males case to be tried first, and when it was postponed to a date after White Females case of the same allegation, ADA again manipulated the calendar to have the White Females case put back behind the Black Males postponement date without cause, other than a persons race, and sex in BAD faith.



The Supreme Court unanimously agreed, finding that the penalty imposed was "so extreme and so divorced from the

Government's damage and expenses as to constitute punishment." 490 U.S. at 442. Thus, the imposition of civil penalties following a criminal prosecution would be barred since the primary purpose of the civil sanctions was to punish or deter the conduct in question. Likewise, Halper suggested that the opposite could be true: imposing punitive civil penalties

first could foreclose subsequent criminal prosecution under the Double Jeopardy Clause such as my family had to endure.



Courts Rebuke DOJ for Abusive Parallel Prosecutions.

Courts are beginning to address those situations where prosecutors use regulatory agencies, such as Child Protective Services , as a stalking horse to develop information for their criminal investigation and to circumvent the strictures of

criminal discovery. As discussed, in United States v. Kordel, 397 U.S. 1 (1970), the Court warned against the use of evidence obtained from civil proceedings if those proceedings were brought to obtain evidence for a criminal

investigation. In United States v. Scrushy, 366 F. Supp. 2d 1134 (N.D. Ala. 2005), the district court suppressed the testimony given by the defendant in an SEC deposition because the supposedly parallel investigations of the U.S.

Attorney’s Office and the SEC were, in fact, a single investigation. Id. at 1139. And this is what exactly happened to me because of ADA Melanie A Shekita. Where the State took on the role of DOJ, and WCHS-CPS took on the role of SEC.



In another case, the SEC investigators essentially were being used by criminal prosecutors to develop their criminal case under the pretext that the matter was being handled only in civil proceedings. In United States v. Stringer, 408 F. Supp. 2d 1083 (D. Or. 2006), criminal prosecutors attempted to gain a strategic advantage by concealing a criminal investigation behind the guise of an ongoing civil investigation. This is exactly what ADA Melanie A Sheketa did you my daughter, my wife, my mom, my dad, my aunts, uncles, friends, and relative, via Wake County Human Services CPS Social Worker, causing my parental rights to be unconstitutional terminated after defrauding the commonwealth of Virginia.



As all of the dictation in the WCHS files of records show the social worker, GAL, and officer of Wake County Family court were conspiring amongst themselves and reporting back to ADA Shekita to prosecute the alleged 2006 case, before the STATE of N.C. even made contact with the Commonwealth of Virginia.  To clearly undermining the purpose of the Wake county Family Court system, and defraud the judges in the commonwealth of Virginia in a legal process.



Specifically, the prosecutors ADA Shekita and CPD Michelle Savage sought to leverage the difficult choice facing the parent in family court: namely, either assert heir Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination or protect the  poor little girl caught in the cross fire of six now eight years old, who not one has seen in over two years because of ADA Melanie Shekita malicious standing and infringement with an unsuspecting family unity interests in the bogus Juvenile civil proceedings commenced by ADA Melanie Shekita.



While the officer of the family court attorneys acted in concert with ADA M. Shekita,  knew my wife and I were targets of a criminal investigation and failed to inform the VA courts of the true matters before the VA court. The STATE did not reveal that critical information to the courts in Hampton Va, when specifically asked by the Va Judge “what’s going on down there in N.C. in re this minor child”.



In fact ADA Melanie A Shekita lied to chief Justice Stephens in writing after a motion to compel discovery filed by myself in early 2008. Where ADA Melanie A Shekita lied and stated she had noting to due with the Juvenile Civil action, when in fact she had everything to do with it because she brought it in family court. but the attorneys of record in the civil action, were concealing this fact at the time and playing along with ADA M. Shekita behind the Courts back in Hampton Va.



Thus, the if the parent  cooperated with the WCHS CPS investigators and waived their privilege against self-incrimination of the DA’s false allegation and charade that was taking place in the civil family wake county courts.



“However, the federal district court judge in the matter of Stringer sharply rebuked the prosecutors for their deceiving the defendants into waiving their Fifth Amendment rights, and dismissed the indictments because of the government misconduct. Id. at 1088”



Not only does the Wake County Family Court engage in impermissible parallel prosecutions in family court on a regular basis, the agency blocks parents from getting access to discovery in the civil proceedings via N.C.G.S. 7b 2901, and confidentially statutes of the WCHS CPS file from allowing any parent to see it, as it only reserved for the attorney in family court and not the parents once the criminal charges are filed or there is a parallel abuse of the system in place and on going.



One court has aptly called this practice “gamesmanship,” and other courts have rightfully decried and rejected this manipulative practice in similarly forceful terms dismissing the civil Actions and holding the principles accountable. See, e.g., SEC v. Sandifur, No. C05- 1631, 2006 WL 3692611 (W.D. Wash. Dec. 11, 2006); SEC v. Kornman, No. 3:04-CV-1803-L, 2006 WL 1506954 (N.D. Tex. May 31, 2006); SEC v. Saad, 229 F.R.D. 90 (S.D.N.Y. 2005); as in what took place during the criminal prosecution case ADA Shekita prosecuted against the defendant  years after the case was ripe for trial, contrary to being ordered not to do so by Superior Court judge Donald Jacobs in 2007. Instead ADA Melanie Shekita was using Wake County Human Service CPS to criminally prosecute parents by for a two year time span, where the minor child was saying that she saw and witness noting and wished to go home to the father and step mother.



United States v. Mahaffy, 446 F. Supp. 2d 115 (E.D.N.Y. 2006). In all of these cases, the government’s playbook is strikingly similar; without informing the target, the government uses a civil investigation to develop evidence supporting criminal charges, brings civil and criminal charges simultaneously, and then moves to stay the civil proceedings in favor of the criminal proceeding, thus ensuring that a defendant will “barely receive any discovery at all.” Saad, 229 F.R.D. at 91.



United States v. Cassese.

Another outrageous case of parallel civil and criminal proceedings by SEC and DOJ involved the prosecution of John J. Cassese, founder and CEO of Computer Horizons Corporation, a leading information technology services

company. United States v. Cassese, 273 F. Supp. 2d 481, 485-88 (S.D.N.Y. 2003)



In a more recent case, a federal judge dismissed an indictment charging immigration fraud against an anti-Castro Cuban political figure seeking naturalization after withdrawing his political asylum application. In United States v. Carriles, 486 F. Supp. 2d 599 (W.D. Tex. 2007), the judge held that "the evidence is overwhelming that the Government improperly manipulated" the administrative and civil investigation process by misrepresenting the true purpose of its investigation and interview of the applicant; namely, that the investigation was a pretext to obtain incriminating evidence for a criminal prosecution. The government appealed the Carriles case to Conclusion. The government's use of civil investigative and enforcement proceedings as a pretext to obtain evidence for subsequent

criminal cases is a troubling trend, which appears to be on the rise. It is the responsibility of counsel, the courts, and DOJ to monitor this practice vigilantly, as to ensure that the constitutional rights of both corporations and individuals are not violated.



What took place in the Civil Acting shocks ones conscience, and is beyond outrageous!!! Where the Wake County family court officers and attorneys in the civil action engaged in deceit, trickery, unlawfully circumventing a courts order in the commonwealth of Virginia, and  fraud to gain evidence for criminal prosecutions under the allegation that my daughter overheard her parents having a non violent disagreement.







RECOMMENDATIONS

1.      Wake County family court civil enforcement attorneys should be forthright with investigative targets, and courts of other STATES about whether the attorneys are, in fact, sharing information with prosecutors, whether such information-sharing has been authorized, and whether the attorneys, and Court of other STATES are aware of any pending criminal investigations before conducting discovery and attempting to seek "voluntary" waivers of their constitutional rights or sending misleading information to Courts in other jurisdictions and STATES.

2.      STATE should decline to initiate parallel criminal proceedings against individual or Parents where administrative and civil options can remedy the violation, and where the civil penalties alone can serve as an effective punishment and deterrent and

3. If criminal enforcement proceedings have been initiated while civil enforcement proceedings are underway, the parents should be able to obtain discovery from the civil action or, at his/her option, have those proceedings stayed until the criminal proceedings have been completed.

4. Defense counsel suspecting grand jury abuse by the prosecutor should file a motion with the court requesting direct supervision of the grand jury.

5. Any penalties, fines, or injunctive relief imposed administratively or civilly should be permitted as an offset for any criminal penalties that a court may impose if criminal prosecution ensues and results in a conviction.

6. Law enforcement should carefully recognize claims by defendants that Governmental attorneys

engaged in deceit, trickery, or fraud to gain evidence for criminal prosecutions.

7. Counsel should heed Justice Breyer's concurring opinion in Hudson and scrutinize civil fines to see whether they are excessive under the Eighth Amendment and whether other constitutional protections have been violated where the STATE caused my parental right to be terminated due to the unconstitutional infringement by ADA Melanie Shekita in bad faith.

8. WCHS-CPS investigative form, which is given to witnesses in civil investigations prior to questioning

by Wake County Family Court attorneys, should be revised to make the waiver of rights notification more

prominent and more informative, preferably at the top of page one and in bold print.

Signatures by the witnesses/targets should be required to further demonstrate a knowing

and voluntary waiver when the STATE infringes upon the Wake County Family Courts. CPS and other regulatory agencies should also provide witnesses or targets with written notification of their rights to prevent inadvertent

waiver of important constitutional rights, including the right to counsel and the right not to make self-incriminating statements.

Dear Ms. Tully,



I have a case where I can show that, scandal, corruption, fraud upon the court, civil conspiracy, and a civil-rico federal crime as transpired. The problem is that this involved wake county government officials. The problem is in me blowing the whistle, places me in fear of reprisals, and jeopardy for life, and liberty.  Where these wake county officials, have violated the false claims act, abused tax payer funds, and conspired to perpetrate a fraud, and perpetuate a fraud. And now have engaged in a civil conspiracy to conceal fraud, engaged in false light, and misrepresentation in the use of federal funds. The issue is these government official hold position of power, yet the fact remains that the files, acting in concert, and records show all of the above allegations, and crimes have been committed.

Dear Govenor,
Please see the link below. We are all in shock as to how the Sam Kafin, the owner of APG Meridian Fence Co. handled this. He was supposed to bring jobs to this area too.
Even his plant manager was not allowed to know of his devious way he planned to shut down. The employees would be coming back from a Christmas break on Jan. 4th totally unaware had someone not come in and caught them loading heavy machines and tools.
Sam Kafin the owner will be back in the Hamlet, NC Plant on Marks Creek Lane off of hwy 177, tommorow, 1/06/10. Here is the article recently published:
<http://www.yourdailyjournal.com/pages/full_story/push?article-Workers+surprised+by+plant+closing%20&id=5405994&instance=secondary_news_left_column>http://www.yourdailyjournal.com/pages/full_story/push?article-Workers+surprised+by+plant+closing%20&id=5405994&instance=secondary_news_left_column

Here is a previous article stating that they will bring 70 jobs to this area.
The most employees ever hired where a little over 30. The the lay offs the past 2 years. There were 12 employees for quite some time.

I know times are tough and even some factories are stuggeling but you do not do this to a crew that has worked their tails off for you. No notice what so ever was given to anyone, including the plant manager!
Thanks for your time, Bet

Subject: the smoking ban

Comment: i can not believe that something like this is happening in this State, i've never felt so helpless in my entire life. this smoking ban is not right and shouldnt have been passed. i dont remember being allowed to vote in it. i'm sure the citizens of this fine state were allow to voice thier opinions. i'm sure that this wasnt just some spur of the moment last minute "oh we dont smoke so no one else can" type thing. long story short, they tried this in ohio, didnt work out too well, many many places had to close thier doors forever. poolhalls are 90% smokers, i know of 2 that have had ppl inside the doors in two days. people down in the in tobaccoo capital of the world are not happy. this would have never happend if wilson could govern itself. the government has no right at all to tell people how to run thier businuss', everyone i can get ahold of is in agreement, even nonsmokers around here said they would help with this, we are boybotting all places effected by this ban, and i will countinue to do this for as long as it takes to get this ban lifted and let be treated like adults. this means takeout too, i will not eat out again for the rest of my life if thats what it takes. i just hope you start listening to the small businuss owners who cant just build a patio overnight, or listen to the people who refuse to be forced outside in 15 degree weather, wind and rain just to smoke. the 15 people blocking the entrance to the places cant look good or be good for businuss. anyway thank you for reading this and thank you for your time. -Michael Ferrell

Subject: FSC CIGARETTES DANGER

Comment: Dear Governor perdue, I would like to share a concern with you that I have noticed as of late. It has to do with the FSC cigarettes that you have voted into law and are now forcing the cigarette manufactures to produce. There is a web site I think you should take a look at http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/repeal-fire-safe-cigarette-laws (feel free to read their comments) this has several people signing a petition to pull the FSC law from the books. Many people are very angry about this not only angry but getting sick. I have been watching this site for now 3 weeks and have noticed that people are signing this at about 200 or more a day complaining about the affects of this non FDA tested item being forced on the American public for consumption. At that rate will be 73,000 in a year. Cigarettes are consumed by the public they are inhaled into the human body and do go into the blood stream. I know your time is of the essence so I will make this short. The "speed bumps" place in these cigarettes are made of ethylene vinyl acetate. otherwise known as Eva. It is used in hot glue sticks and plastic wraps also used in syringes. So you get my meaning it is plastic. The other thing put in this bump is polyvinyl acetate. That is used as wood glue or carpenters glue. The Harvard School of Health reported that when comparing NY Cigarettes (FSC) versus Regular Cigarettes, the FSC cigarettes produced 13.9% more Naphthalene and 11.4% more carbon monoxide than regular cigarettes.[1] Naphthalene is commonly found in moth balls, and exposure in high amounts can result in %U.N. Symptoms of acute exposure includes headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise, confusion, anemia, jaundice, convulsions, and coma. %U.N.[2] Therefore, it has been proven that FSC cigarettes contain higher levels of chemicals that are harmful to smokers. These are the symptoms that are what is being reported. Because the other problem is that people have to puff on the cigarette more then before to keep it lit therefore inhaling more of the cigarettes new found chemicals. The other item about these are that it gives a false sense of security. "Oh they are fire safe I can leave it. It will go out." This could potentially create more fires then before. I also have seen where the entire "cherry" of the cigarette falls out. Creating a even bigger danger I.E someone driving on the freeway and the "cherry" falls in their lap. The other problem is that when you relight it more hot ash falls from it then before. So basically this could go wrong for the United States in so many ways. 1. We could start growing our own tobacco meaning you do not make your tax dollars off them. 2. The health care bill you just passed will be in big trouble because now there are more sick and dying then before. And the ones you get cigarette taxes from are either quitting, sick/dying/dead or growing their own. 3. The government is the defendant in a class action suit.(already talk of that) I understand that you are trying to save us from harm but please we are big kids we can handle a cigarette. Or give us a choice make both kinds available Please repeal this law. Thank You for your time Kimberli Perry
