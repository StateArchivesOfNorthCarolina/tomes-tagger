The Honorable Beverly Perdue

Governor for this Great State of North Carolina,



First Governor, allow me to extend my congratulations to a most successful campaign. As you stated on many occasions, while campaigning across this state; ìIt takes all of us to make it work.î



While your tenure has only begun, it is truly refreshing to see you come out in favor of an open and inclusive government as exemplified in the January 14th Raleigh News and Observer article ìThatís an orderî.î Perdue also signed orders to post state grants and contracts on a central Web site. That's another good public access idea, along with town hall meetings, four of them, during her term. And Perdue was consistent in her campaign in vowing to open state records and conduct business in the open, which wasn't always the case with former Gov. Mike Easley.î



It is very frustrating when one knows of a true injustice and canít seem to get anyone to just look at it unbiased. This is especially true, when considering our present economic state of affairs. Fulfilling the need list should always prioritize the wish list of special interest.



Governor Iím attaching some points for study on my concerns; I truly recognize how busy you are but strongly feel this is deserving of considerations and study by your task force. Please donít hesitate to contact me if I can answer any question or be of service in any way.



Respectfully,



Steven F. Shell

Why donít you do something about all of the animals in your state who are being killed in shelters very day?????? No one ever wants to hear about this? Why?† Why donít you people spay and neuter your dogs and cats? If you did this like we do up north you wouldnít have to kill innocent dogs and cats every day and make them suffer due to stupid, stupid, people. We are trying to save your dogs every day here, and we are rescuing a lot of them thank god, and they donít have to face the BARBERIC deaths that they are given on a daily basis by you dób people. I cant in a million years accept the way you people think, up here in the northern states are dogs are our pets, they are loved and they are valued, when we lose one,it hurts, really bad.† You need to do something about this, you are someone that can make a difference, I am speaking for all the innocent animals slaughtered every day in your state, because their voices cannot be heard and no one of importance seems to be listening to all the voices that are trying to save them every day, iam one of those people. Just rescued a beautiful lab, who had 10 puppies in one of your shelters, only one baby lived. They where gonna heartstick her because no one wanted her. She arrived on a rescue transport to me 3 weeks ago. She is precious, I cannot imagine our family without her. Only wish there was more people like me that have saved a southern dogÖÖÖÖÖÖÖ..donít know what is more cruel, the gassing or the heartsticks?† Surprised your not just shooting the poor souls, well Iím sure thatís going on alsoÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖyou have the power to change the lawsÖDO SO for the ones that donít have a voice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! one pissed off lady up north

Gov. Perdue visits Surry and Alleghany counties

Surry County

On Tuesday, Gov. Perdue attended a class and met with students at the Surry Early College High School of Design on Surry Community Collegeís campus in Dobson.† North Carolina is†a national leader when it comes to Early Colleges, with 70 locations.† Students enrolled in this program attend high school on a college campus for five years and finish with a high school diploma and two years of transferable college credit or an associate degree ñ at no cost to the student.

Gov. Perdue met with Principal Celia Hodges, Community College President Dr. Deborah Friedman, members of the collegeís board, and other local education officials.† Most importantly, Gov. Perdue had the opportunity to sit in on a†biology class taught by Jeff Edwards.†

Students told the Governor about being excited to ìget a really good head start on lifeî and about how North Carolinaís Early College program makes higher education affordable to them.† Innovative programs like this are important to Gov. Perdueís goal of putting higher education within reach for all North Carolinians.

Alleghany County

On Wednesday, Gov. Perdue†visited Sparta Elementary School.† As part of President Obamaís ìUnited We Serveî campaign for†community service and volunteerism, the governor spoke with students about their responsibility of giving back to their communities.† She read the†children's book ìIím Gonna Like Me: Letting Off A Little Self-Esteemî by actress Jamie Lee Curtis to†a first grade class.†

The governor†also had the chance to talk to Superintendent Cox, Principal Barnes,†and teachers†about how technology is making a difference in their classrooms and about diagnostic testing.

DuPont Brings $55 Million Expansion to Bladen County

DuPont will add a new facility on a portion of its Fayetteville Works campus in Bladen County, creating 10 jobs and investing $55 million during the next three years.† The announcement of the new plant, which will make a key component in solar energy panels, was made possible in part by a $50,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

ìDuPont's expansion confirms that we are reaping the benefits from our investments in a knowledge-based work force and community infrastructure,î Perdue said.† ìSupport of our existing industries, education and an exceptional quality of life are among the many reasons North Carolina's business climate is consistently ranked among the top in the nation.î

DuPont employs 60,000 workers in 70 countries worldwide, including more than 900 at N.C. facilities in Fayetteville, Kinston and the Research Triangle Park.† The new plant, in Bladen County near the Cumberland-Bladen County line, will produce polymer for DuPont ô TedlarÆ polyvinyl fluoride film used in the protective backsheets of photovoltaic solar panels.† These panels convert light into electric power.† The photovoltaic industry is experiencing worldwide growth as consumers turn to alternatives such as fossil fuels.†

Salaries for the 10 new skilled manufacturer positions will vary by job type, but the average annual wage will be $36,278, not including benefits, more than the Bladen County average annual wage of $25,792.

For more information about DuPontô TedlarÆ films or potential job opportunities, please visit: <http://www.dupont.com>www.dupont.com.

Swedish Firm Relocates U.S. Headquarters to Charlotte

Biotage LLC, a Swedish company that develops and manufactures instruments and consumables for pharmaceutical research, will relocate its United States headquarters to Charlotte.† The company plans to invest in facility upgrades and create 21 new jobs in Mecklenburg County.

ìNorth Carolina is known globally as a strategic location for tapping into the North American market,î Perdue said.† ìOur top-rated business climate and highly skilled workforce continue to attract global companies looking to invest and expand.î

Biotage is a leading supplier of tools and technology for medicinal and analytical chemistry and process development.† The company, headquartered in Sweden, has offices in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Japan and employs nearly 270 workers worldwide.

The company is planning to move its U.S. headquarters from Virginia to North Carolina.† Operations in Charlotte will include general administration, marketing and sales, and lab work for applications development, light manufacturing and distribution.

Gov. Perdue Announces Launch of 15th Anniversary "Booze It & Lose It" Campaign

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced the launch of the 15th anniversary ìBooze It & Lose Itî mobilization to crack down on impaired drivers. The Labor Day ìBooze It & Lose Itî campaign will begin Aug. 21 and run until Sept. 7.

ìUnder no circumstance is drinking and driving acceptable in North Carolina,î said Perdue. ìFor 15 years, the ëBooze It & Lose Ití initiative has played a critical role in protecting our citizens by educating the public and cracking down on impaired driving. Weíll keep using this life-saving campaign as a tool to enforce our stateís anti-drinking and driving laws.î

In North Carolina in 2008, there were 11,968 alcohol-related crashes resulting in 433 fatalities and 9,263 injuries.

ìBooze It & Lose Itî is administered by the N.C. Governorís Highway Safety Program. The initiative began in 1994 and was created to zero in on impaired drivers with innovative and extensive anti-driving while impaired enforcement and education. Since 1994, law enforcement agencies have conducted more than 194,000 checkpoints and patrols during ìBooze It & Lose Itî campaigns resulting in more than 103,000 driving while impaired citations.

Additional checkpoints and patrols will be conducted across the state throughout the campaign.

Fight the Flu - Back to School

As thousands of students in North Carolina prepare to return to school, many will be armed with notebooks and pencils, but†they†also should be armed with tips to fight the spread of seasonal and H1N1 flu.

Everyone is advised to get a seasonal Flu Vaccine. H1N1 vaccines are expected by late†fall. High risk groups, including school-aged children, are advised to get a double dose H1N1 vaccination.

Prevention is critical.† Here are some simple steps:

1) Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.† If†you donít have tissue, cough or sneeze into your sleeve.

2) Wash your hands often with soap and water. Alcohol-based hand cleaners†also are effective.

3) Avoid close contact with sick people.

4) If you are sick, stay home to limit†the chances of infecting others.

Dear Madam Governor,
I applaud you for making "accountability" a priority. Especially un announced drop in's. It is beneficial for the patients, caregivers, holds administrations accountable. The old saying "You are not getting lip service", they know at any giving time, you could and will stop in un announced.
Governor, at this time I do have a few recommendations for you to look into. I have written to President Obama with these suggestions as well.
With all of the middle class being displaced, and employment paying the maximums of $500.00, there is a very serious problems. Remember, these people paid into this with their taxes for many years.

First, that $500.00 per week , makes these people ineligible for any government help, such as food stamps, medical, help paying heating bills. There is no way these people can continue to pay a mortgage, food on the table, medical insurance on $500.00
Second, no family can afford Cobra insurance payments. It is so high, they had to make a decision to purchase food or insurance. Also by the time the cobra gets the papers right, the individual has had to pay out of pocket for their prescriptions or they leave them at the pharmacy. Most of the time when they come to the pharmacy for a script, say they have cobra, we know it won't be covered, it never is. Pharmacy has to tell them their cobra is not in effect and must pay cash for prescriptions. How do I know this, I work in a pharmacy and I have to tell them their cobra is not in effect yet.

Third, Food stamps† would help many people here in North Carolina, but the very citizens who paid into the government all these years, can not get help due to the fact they make $200.00 over the limit of who qualifies. Can you pay a mortgage, electric, gas, food , medical on $2000.00 a month???? There are many states that have too low of a limit to help these middle class people out. They need help now and by rising the qualification standards, you will be helping the class that has supported these programs all these years.
How do I know this, My daughter is one who has been displaced, makes $500.00 per week, tries to sign up for these programs, she makes $200. or $400. over the limit. We have spoken to other citizens who are in the same predicament. Many are about to loose their homes, because they can not make it on $500.00 per week.
Please look into this, rise the limits.
I feel the states should not get any of the Bail out money, if they do not raise their limits so more citizens are eligable for food stamps, health care, or programs available. For too many years some families have lived off of these programs, never worked a day in their lives. I, along with millions of other workers have supported these people with our tax dollar. Now when we need it, we make too much. ????? We will be starting a letter campain to get these programs available to the displaced.
We would appricate any help you can give us, thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Donna Potter

On-Site Accountability



Friends,



Friday I made an unannounced visit to Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro.† I made a pledge to the citizens of this state upon taking office that I would make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies a priority during my administration. This is just one way of fulfilling my promise of being a hands-on governor, and this visit is the first of many.



Cherry Hospital, as you know, has been a high-profile example of what's been wrong with our state's mental health system.† During the 90 minutes I spent at Cherry, I met with hospital leaders, caregivers and patients.† I asked them straightforward questions and I got honest answers. I let them know that I've raised the bar.

In fact, I hope all of my new cabinet secretaries will take this hands-on approach and become a familiar sight to those working within their agencies.



My vision is for North Carolina's mental health system to be the gold standard for the nation.† I want you to know that we've begun that process, and we wonít stop until we get it right ñ for our patients, for our patientsí families, and for all North Carolina citizens.

I have attached all that I feel is important for you all to understand why I am writing this email.† My main concern is that the EOG's have TOO much power.† They have the power to retain a child...even if the child is an A or an A/B student.† I know that one would argue with me on that point, but if that isn't true then how come a parent and or teacher has to go before a school board and plead that students case in order for him/her to move to the next grade.† Then the ultimate decision falls on the principal, who hasn't even seen your child perform in a classroom situation.† So, really EOG's do hold a lot more power than anyone will admit to.† When I addressed this issue to Mrs. McManus she told me that the EOG's were just a "snapshot" of what the student could do.† If that is true, why are we spending so much money "snapshotting" our students when really that should be the task of the teacher who is with that student each day.† Testing is costing a fortune.† Money could be saved (and a lot of it) if we would put our money back into the teacher's classroom and allow him/her to teach.

I talked with Sara McManus this past Friday, only to learn that the reading†EOG questions have "distractors" placed within them which completely leads our students away from making a correct choice.† Also, she said that there are 2 good answers, but only 1 is the best.† I have a problem with that due to the fact that my son's experiences differ from other students experiences.† I feel that we are setting up our students across NC for failure by making the test so abstract.†† Here is something that someone needs to do.† Look at the current students that made a 1 or a 2 on the EOG 2007-2008 and current pre-EOG scores, compare that score with their classroom ability...many you will find are honor roll students.† Take a look at the money that NC spent on testing and retesting these students (many who were honor roll students)and then factor into that the cost of summer school.††Would it not behoove†us to allow†the teacher to discern whether a student should take the test two times? This could save NC a lot of money.† Many of our third graders, this year, didn't pass the pre-EOG...and yes, some were even in the advanced learning classes.† Shouldn't that be looked into instead of blowing it off and thinking that our teachers are doing a poor job?

I spoke with Mrs. McManus regarding why students do not take the CAT.† She said it was a very concrete test...different from the answer you will see given by the†NCGA staff.† They said it was because teachers were teaching to the test...what do they think teachers are doing now?? Teachers are teaching to the test more so now than ever.† She told me the reading †EOG is set up for higher order thinking.
I have asked Mrs. McManus to consider making a fair EOG...the reply was that we need to get our students ready for the 21st century.†I suggested that 1/2 of the test consist of concrete thinking and the other 1/2 consist of higher order thinking.†It's all about 'higher order thinking' which when all things are considered most adults have problems with that concept.† I would like to challenge you to find an EOG test booklet and look closely at the reading.† Most psychologists will tell you that higher order thinking is a skill for college age students, not elementary, middle, and high school.†

We are looking at a society of young students, dependent on anxiety and depression medications, because our testing has made them feel inadequent; therefore they drop out of school and do not become a productive citizen.† What if the DPI had to pay for the medical bills for students that are currently on anxiety medications due to testing?† I bet then they would rethink how the EOG should be set up.† It seems that no one is able to give me straight answers.† I talk to one person who tells me to talk to someone else who shifts me over to another person.† If we want young men and women to get a higher education or become productive citizens,†we must ensure that our teachers can teach something other than the test.† We are dumbing down our students daily by all of this 'global competitiveness' †jibber jabber.† We are always going to need plumbers, electrians, garbage collectors, landscape businesses....we all are not called to be rocket scientists.† We are trying to put our students into a mold instead of allowing them to pursue their calling in life.

So, why do I continue to write our†Senators and Representatives?† My son took the†EOG last year (2007-2008).††Up until this point he had scored a high 3 in reading, but†once the criteria for grading the test was changed his score dropped to a 1.† He is an A/B student and his current average in language arts is a 97.† He is sitting in remediation with 21 other students who are also A, B, and C students.† Something is terribly wrong with this picture. It's not just the school my son attends but across the county and extending into surrounding counties.† How can this many students be so low when just the year before they were on the 3 and 4 scale†of the EOG?††I should interject here that I recently paid for my son to take the CAT test.† He scored in the 91% percentile.† He is not†below average†as would the EOG score represent.†I made him take it to prove a point.†What point, you may ask.† I want someone to see that my son is capable and intelligent and the EOG scores were incorrect on scoring his ability.†

Why are those in the DPI so resistant to hear the voice of parents and educators?† I hold a master's degree and desired to continue my education because I saw and still see learning as fun.† How many students find learning fun?† Not many. We are sucking the life out of our teachers by not allowing them to teach and to use scare tatics about job security, †meeting AYP goals and percentage of students in their classroom to pass the EOG.† We have already sucked the life out of many students..look at the drop out rate.† Students don't†care because the test is too hard for them.††Does the DPI realize that presently their are schools where the principal has gone to all 3rd-5th grade†teachers and told them NOT to teach anything other than reading and math until EOG's are finished. †Does that tell you all something about how much pressure our teachers are under?†

Please let me know who will listen to the voice of parents and educators.† We deperately need the EOG's to be revamped.

Thank you,
Nancy Umberger

First of all what is the purpose in the bill to change the position of Superintendent of Public Instruction to an appointed position instead of an elected position?† Do you not have confidence in your constituents and who they elect into office (do you think you‚Äôre there by mistake)?


As I have written many times ‚ÄúALL‚Äù state employees should be treated the same.† If we are in such a deficit why does June Atkinson have someone doing her job making twice what she does?† Why was Britt Cobb who was eligible for retirement asked to stay on with state government with a salary increase for him and his wife Ann?

Why was Linda Coleman appointed to Commissioner of OSP only if Governor Perdue ‚Äúmet Ms. Coleman‚Äôs salary requirements‚Äù? These decisions were made knowing the budget crisis we were in.



In my opinion one of the best ways to help the budget is to start working for your state and forget the good ‚Äòol boys and girls program.† All of that has gone on too long, that‚Äôs a part of why we are where we are.



Force people eligible to retire making over 85,000 to retire and give those making less an opportunity to make more.



Investigate your HR depts., are people who deserve promotions really getting them or is politics in the way?† Why doesn‚Äôt a person loyal to a dept. with outstanding evaluations mean anything anymore?† Our current generation expects to get paid a whole lot for doing very little, is that the example our culture truly needs?† You should get what you deserve based on your work and your ethics not who you or somebody in your family knows; how fair is that to the ‚Äúcommon‚Äù voter?



My sister-in-law teaches Spanish I & II in high school.† She was telling of an instance in her Spanish II class where she had played a video in French and it took her class about 20 ‚Äì 30 minutes to figure out it was French instead of Spanish; what does that say for her teaching abilities.† Yet every year she gets more of an increase than I do.



Now the biggie, our health plan.† If there are so many financial problems with our health plan then it seems as though someone way up the food chain (you know the one‚Äôs, making the big bucks ‚Äì over $35,000) is not doing their job.† But state employees are going to be penalized for that.† We obviously need a better shopper and negotiator for our health plan since BCBS has made such a profit just on state government.† But lower waged state employees should not be penalized for higher waged state employees not doing their jobs properly.† As for the issue about people overweight and smokers paying more for insurance coverage, talk about DISCRIMINATION, oh my God.† How ludicrous..



I look forward to hearing from each of you personally and how you plan to take care of the people who put you in a decision making position.

I can not believe that your office is cutting the budgets on the school system!† If the set budget was not enough, we have the "NC EDUCATION LOTTERY"..† That should fund the schools, right?† Where is this money going?† I know for a fact that the school system can, at its current enrollment rate, still use a few more good teachers!† I do not want my children going to a school that I plenty of taxes for, with inadequate staffing.† Is there going to be 35 kids in a classroom now??† With no TA's?† seriously, Im asking...?...† If I am way out of line I would love an explanation as to why this is being done..

Dear Governor Purdue,

I am writing to you as the director of a child care program and a member of the NC Child Care Coalition. I have just read about the budget cuts to the Division of Child Development. I know that in this very difficult financial time cuts had to be made. I want to thank you for making those cuts to early childhood as small as possible. As an early childhood advocate I support your†budget and appreciate your goal to protect those programs that directly affect our youngest citizens.

Sincerely,

Pam Anderson

I realize that in todayís economic conditions everyone is looking for ways ìto tighten their beltî.† In our homes, we have had to look for ways to cut our expenditures.† Our company, in an effort to maintain a strong, stable company has taken steps in advance of a crisis to cut expenditures.† I, for one, am thankful our top executives were bold enough to take these steps to avert financial problems in the future.



I worked for the NC State Government many years ago and the pay back then was not nearly as appealing then as it s now.† I also had my wages frozen for two years.† As a young inexperience worker, I felt the private world would better suit my needs.† I worked for thirteen years for a private company that eventually went bankrupt due to poor management.



Let me tell you about some of the cuts we have made locally that have affected 500 employees.† The maximum number of weeks we could earn was three weeksÖ..that has now been slashed to two weeks.† We have no sick paid daysÖyou take a vacation day if you are.† We also just had to take a 2.5% cut in pay and temporarily lost our 401K match.† These cuts may seem drastic, but I feel secure that my company will be viable within their balanced budget.



I have many friends and relatives that are employed and paid well by the State of North Carolina.† Most of these employees get five weeks vacation and better than two weeks paid sick leave.† In addition, I understand that if you retire as a state employee you donít have to pay North Carolina State income tax.† This seems a little out of place considering we are all being asked to tighten our belts.† Let us assume there are 5,000 employees at 40 hours vacation at approximately $20.00, if that one week of vacation were revoked, that alone would be a $4,000,000.00 savings.† Also, I donít understand why retirees should be afforded the luxury of no NC State income tax being dueÖ.you have thousands of people in this state struggling to pay their taxes for retirees to pay none!† This just doesnít seem exactly fair and equitable.



We have students graduating from college as trained teachers (some with their education paid for by the state) and we canít place them due to a hiring freeze.† Right here in my community we have had teachers and principals retire and come back to work as contract workers.† That is double dipping!† We have two new prisons built in the western part of our state ready to be opened, but with a hiring freeze we canít man them.† I guess we will be like California and cut the sentences for offenders to make room in our existing jails.†



These are just a few of my thoughts on our stateís current economic situation.† I wish you and your staff Godís wisdom while tackling these difficult times.† I want our state to continue to prosper and grow.† I have a son and I want him to know what a great state he lives in and can be proud of his roots.†

Subject: Where does all the money go?

Comment: Ma‚Äôam, With most of North Carolina‚Äôs reserve vehicles in equipment deployed to Iraq over the last 5+ years, many of our units do not have equipment. The equipment we had has either been refitted and sold to the Iraqis or eliminated from our inventories. 1 - The active duty will have a vast number of MRAP series to refit their units, but how is the federal government going to refit your reserve and national guard forces? 2 ‚Äì I am not an economist or policy expert, but it seems strange that the American auto makers are not spearheading the development and production of military vehicles ‚Äì especially for smaller vehicles such as the HUMMWV or troop carriers. When did the United States stop serving as the primary producer of outfitting its defense force? Who will produce the repair parts for these vehicles? From what I have seen, NC is planning to take all of the stimulus offered from the federal government; and many of the stipulations will require a continuation of services and programs. Please read take time to dissect the lengthy document and identify what is best for NC for the long term; a program with limited federal funding seems like a NC problem down the road... higher taxes or a similar situation to the No Child Left Behind Act. Thank you for your time, Michelle

Subject: many questions??????????????????????????????????????????

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, Why does DOC, wonder why they do not have enough money to manage there facilities? They cost us more money as tax payers every day with there BS, EXAMPLE:an inmate is in minimum custody which cost quite a bit less than medium or maximum custody, and they happen to get a right up of some sort, so they get 45 days in the hole, limited draw, no visitations, no phone for 60 days, and then they get sent back to meduim custody, do they really feel that being put in a hole like an animal is not enough to realize that they had made a big mistake, I mean, was an incident so bad as all that, especially when our enconomy is like it is. People want to talk about the prison system being broken and they do not want to discuss why it is broken, the people running the facilities are so very petty. I feel that the people that have worked so hard to get to feel like human beings, doing human things, and then they make one wrong move and the system does not consider that they have pretty much done the time for the crime that they went in for, they look at the incident and then see why they are in there and charge them for the crime they committed 13 years ago instead of the incident at hand. Govenor Perdue our system is broken, I have talked to so many people at DOC, these past two months, it is as if they have all taken the same class on how to blow smoke up people's ass, they say things like, I am sorry that I can not help you, there is nothing I can do,or you have the right to appeal, or the inmate can file a grievence, they (DOC) are thick as thieves, and have some issues of there very own. When they do not know how to talk to the public, every thing is black or white, when they are uneducated, and just common liars, we do not have the ability to right them up or put them in a hole. For me stealing money from your work place is just as bad as talking on a cell phone from work release. When people do nothing and they all play the same game and none of them can do there job because they have to go along with each other, why are they there if they can not think for themselves or make educated investigations into what the incident at hand is. Why are we paying them to sit there and go along with the each other. When they say you can appeal something, you can here the snicker in there voice, they are so very certain that it will not change anything.I have been trying to reach Alvin Keller for over one month, I truly feel that the tax payers have a right to know just what DOC is really about. I would also like to have a meeting with you on finding a solution, I have a great deal that I can bring to the table in this matter, it would cut the expenses of housing these inmates by a very large margin. I have told them that I would like to get your take on it first, before I go any further. I am at a point of no return with this current system, and I truly need your help at this time. Also I campained for Roy Carter for 1 year, He coached my chidren in football for a couple of years, I work with people who have drug and alcohol problems, I have spoken at schools, hospitals, conventions, about drugs and alcohol abuse. I do alot of community service, I feel this is worthy of my time and possibly a calling to help the people in the system that do not have a voice, it is a joke when they tell one of them to file a grievence and everyone of them know it. Some of them committed serious crimes when they were locked up, punishing them for an incident or a right up for something they did 13 years prior is unacceptable and a waste of money and resources. I keep saying this because when I proceed to ask DOC, if they really feel that the punishment for the right up given,fits the incident at hand, that is there argument, well he committed a serious crime in 1996. Well he has also served 2 complete sentences and working on his last one, that has nothing to do with what he was wriiten up for. Well then they say we have to protect the community. Well he is not a threat to the community and the real threat is our economy. Seems to me the system is part of the problem rather than part of the solution. Please know that I am writing you as a last resort, I have gone through every chain of command, now I wish that I had not even folllowed protocal, because it has been a huge waste of my time and effort, other than the fact that I learned just how bad things really are when people do not do there job. It is just another form of stealing. Nor do they give a damn about someones mental state and just how much should one have to bare, even if they are just a number to the facility, one day they will be in our society, really how is our system teaching them to be productive members of society, when all they see is people making up there on rules and then telling them to file a grievence and laughing at them, because the people telling them that, already know that no one will over turn there decision, It is beyond anything that I have ever seen in my life and I have seen a lot. The system is broken, maybe one person can not make a difference but one person can exploit what is going on in the system. Media is not really the route I want to go, I feel that my hand is being forced, because no one seems to hear what I am saying. They will not be able to take my voice like they have taken the inmates voice with there methods. This is important enough to keep me up nights, that has not ever happened to me, Nor have I ever written anyone for help in any matter, I am writting you because, I feel that there are things that you need to know in order to be effective and make a difference. Also because I feel that with your guidance I may not make as many mistakes in this process, I know it will be a process and I understand that it will not change over night, and I also know that if I just do nothing, nothing will ever change, my heart is in it. So the inmates, may not have a voice but I do, I pay taxes, there must be a reason that I feel these guys and girls need a voice. Please Please Please, help me to help others and our economy. Thank You in advance for your time in this matter. You may contact me anytime, at 336-452-1038 Kimberly Y. B. Wilson

One thing I forgot to mention is Merit Pay.† We get annual reviews that are not used for raises.† I think that people who do a good job and don't abuse there vacation and sick time should get a good†raise. This can be done with Merit Pay.† There should not be across†the board raises.

Subject: Immigrants

Comment: Prime Minister Kevin Rudd - Australia Muslims who want to live under Islamic Sharia law were told on Wednesday to get out of Australia , as the government targeted radicals in a bid to head off potential terror attacks.. Separately, Rudd angered some Australian Muslims on Wednesday by saying he supported spy agencies monitoring the nation's mosques. Quote: 'IMMIGRANTS, NOT AUSTRALIANS, MUST ADAPT. Take It Or Leave It. I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks on Bali , we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Australians. ' 'This culture has been developed over two centuries of struggles, trials and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom' 'We speak mainly ENGLISH, not Spanish, Lebanese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society . Learn the language!' 'Most Australians believe in God. This is not some Christian, right wing, political push, but a fact, because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture.' 'We will accept your beliefs and will not question why. All we ask is that you accept ours and live in harmony and peaceful enjoyment with us.' 'This is OUR COUNTRY, OUR LAND, and OUR LIFESTYLE, and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy all this. But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about Our Flag, Our Pledge, Our Christian beliefs, or Our Way of Life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great Australian freedom, 'THE RIGHT TO LEAVE'.' 'If you aren't happy here then LEAVE. We didn't force you to come here. You asked to be here. So accept the country YOU accepted.'

Clinton Foundation 55 West 125th Street New York, NY 10027 Dear honorable former great President Bill Clinton: Please kindly grant my warmest greetings, highest respect, and sincerity. I would like to share my thoughts with your honorable that will be very helpful in your lofty leadership in stopping the for sure down fall of the great Democratic Party. As your honorable may remember, I have tried very hard to defend the Constitution of the United States in the dispute of the Presidential Election of 2000 in which I wrote in my letter of December 16, 2000 to the Supreme Court of the United States as, ‚ÄúThe United States in known for justice, freedom and free election and it has been damaged greatly if it was not lost. They have done to themselves and to country great disservice. This was the worse way someone to become the president and this was the best that could happen for Democrats.‚Äù Please see the enclosed letter of December 16, 2008. Thank you. I wrote in my letter of April 22, 2008 to some great Leaders of the United States as, ‚ÄúThe Constitution in any society is the highest document, proper guidelines, instruction, and the will of the people and for keeping the unity, peace, and functional system of government for the best and wellbeing of the citizen therefore the citizen and members of the government should honor, respect, and value very highly the Constitution.‚Äù Please kindly see the enclosed letter of April 22, 2008. Thank you. The Presidential Candidate Barack Obama knew he was not eligible to be the President of the United States and should not have getting in the Presidential Race of 2008. I would have preferred your lovely wife the admirable former Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton for the President if I knew that former Senator Barack Obama intentionally concealed truth of his birthplace in order to be elected into highest office of the land the Presidency of the United States and the country would have been much better off with President Hillary Rodham Clinton. The great Democratic Party did not do a good job in the Presidential Election of 2008. The lawsuit was filed against Barack Obama in the State of Pennsylvania on August 21, 2008 because the Democratic Party failed to do the right thing telling former Senator to withdraw from the Presidential Race but they tried cover it up and to be obstacle for those who were honest and patriotic in upholding the highest document of the country the Constitution. I have terminated my cooperation, friendship, and communication with the Democratic Party until they put their house in order by honoring, defending, protecting, preserving, and obeying the Constitution and helping the very wrongly and disqualified President Barack Obama to resign soon otherwise I will have nothing to do with the Democratic Party ever again for undermining the historical document of the country the Constitution and the uniqueness, integrity, and sanctity of the highest office of the land the Presidency of the United States and will publish my book about the biggest fraud of the Presidential Election of 2008 that will be great losing and irrecoverable for the Democratic Party for many years to come. I welcome your honorable and other great Leaders of the Democratic Party‚Äôs superb Leadership in this very great important issue in the Democratic Party and the country. Thank you for listening, good understanding, and cooperation. I wish your majesty, your wonderful wife Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton, and your beautiful daughter Miss. Chelsea Clinton the best of everything, a very good and healthy life, and happiness. May the Omnipresent God blesses your majesty and your dear family richly, be with you, protect you, and guides your honorable in your wise decision making, in your sound judgment, lofty leadership, and in your great responsibility. May the Love and the Blessing of the Most Merciful God fill your hearts, your house, your life, and makes every day of your life joyful, cheerful, prosperous, and thankful day. My prayers are with your majesty, with your sweet family, and with the noble and good people of the great Democratic Party. Have a pleasant, enjoyable, fabulous Friday, splendid Saturday, and stupendous Sunday, and much better week. With best wishes, beautiful thoughts, and love, Thankfully Yours, Aman‚Äôu‚Äôllah Farahmandnia Aman‚Äôu‚Äôllah Farahmandnia 3225 Markway Rd. Toledo, Ohio 43606 February 3, 2009 RE: your honorable letter of February 2, 2009 Dear very wrongly, ineligible, disqualified, undeserved, unpatriotic, un-American, and most dishonest former Senator Barack Obama: Please kindly tell the truth to the American people, stop playing game, resign today better than tomorrow, and believe me it is not funny! Why do you wish to be the cause of the ills of the country, trashing the highest document of the country the Constitution and undermining the rule of law, disobeying and dishonoring the Founding Fathers of the Constitution and great United States? Why did you start this mess and why do wish to prolong this unnecessary and not needed problem for the country, government, court system, and the Office of the President of the United States? I have no respect for who does not respect the Rule of Law and Constitution. Please kindly unsubscribe me from your mailing list until your honorable clear the matter of eligibility and qualification your Presidential candidacy as it is required to be natural born citizen of the United States. Thank you. My letter of October 27, 2008. Sincerely yours, Aman‚Äôu‚Äôllah Farahmandnia‚Äù Aman‚Äôu‚Äôllah Farahmandnia 3225 Markway Rd. Toledo, Ohio 43606 March 14, 2009 RE: Your honorable letter of March 13, 2009 The office of the great Senator of the State of Massachusetts His honorable and very caring Senator John Kerry 304 Russell Bldg. Third Floor Washington D.C. 20510 Dear honorable and patriotic, and caring Senator John Kerry: Please kindly accept me warmest greetings, highest respect, and sincerity. I would like to share my very final good and sincere thoughts with your honorable that might be very helpful in your lofty leadership in the Senate of the United States and for the very best of Democratic Party. Your honorable wrote in your letter of March 13, 2009 as, ‚ÄúIt's been interesting watching the Republicans the last couple months - continuing the "just say no" strategy that failed them the last two election cycles, and failed the American people during the years they ran Washington.‚Äù Please kindly note: It is much more interesting in watching the Democratic Party to cover their party member the very guilty, hypocrite, unpatriotic, misleader, deceiver, disqualified, born in Kenya, is citizen of Indonesia, and ignorant Barack Obama with very little experience to trash the highest document of the country the Constitution and to become illegally and unconstitutionally President of the United States. The Republican failed because the Democratic Party dare not to stand up for what was true, right, and just in impeaching the war criminal former President George W. Bush and the American voted for the change for the better not the worst dishonoring, disobeying, and disrespecting the Constitution of the United States that is the Foundation and standard of the nation in which many soldiers, militias, Indians, people sacrificed their lives for writing and establishing the Constitution and this great country and has been defended, protected, preserved for more than 200 years but now the Democratic Party has no courage to defend it as the last generation of great leaders and American did. The message of change is positive, good, and promising if starts from the top that is Barack Obama change from being dishonest to honest, being un-American to America by respecting and obeying the Constitution, being unpatriotic to patriotic, being phony to reality, and putting interest of the country above his selfish and lust of fame, honor, and power. Constitution in any society is the highest Rule of Law and guarantees that everyone is treated the same under the law. The Constitution to people and the members of the government is like the Holy Bible to the believers in which believing without obeying and following the teaching of the Holy Bible is unbelief with incomparable punishment; The Constitution is the Foundation of the Government and country and will collapse as the building fall down from a shaky foundation. The honorable and wonderful Speaker Nancy Pelosi after becoming the first woman as the Speaker of the Congress said as, ‚ÄúOpenness, transparency, and accountability are hallmarks of the New Direction Congress. Accountability demands responsibility to American taxpayers on how their money is spent, and responsibility to future generations not to burden them with mountains of debt‚Ä¶ The thread that runs through all our legislation is accountability.‚Äù Speaker Nancy Pelosi October 4, 2007. Please kindly note. Openness means to be honest with hardworking America Taxpayers who are paying for the Government. Transparency means the members of the government who are the reflection and representatives of the citizen to see things clearly and accurately. Accountability means taking the responsibility of correcting for the wrong have been done at the very critical time. Please kindly unsubscribe my from your mailing list until the democratic Party honors, respects, obeys, preserves the constitution of the United States. Thank you. I wish your honorable, your lovely wife Mrs. Teresa Heinz Kerry, your beautiful daughters Ms. Alexandra and Ms. Vanessa, and your good looking sons Mr. John, Mr. Andre, and Mr. Christopher the best of everything, a very good and healthy life, and happiness. May the Most Merciful God blesses your honorable and your dear family richly, be with you, protect you, and guides your honorable in your wise decision making, in your good vision, in your superb leadership, and in your great responsibilities. May the Love and the Blessing of the Most Holy God fill your hearts, your house, your life, and makes every day of your life joyful, delightful, successful, and thankful day. My prayers are with your honorable, with your wonderful family, and kind people of the great State of Massachusetts. Have a pleasant, enjoyable, sweet Saturday, and splendid Sunday, and much better week. With best wishes, beautiful thoughts, and love, Faithfully Yours, Aman'u'llah Farahmandnia CC: The honorable and great Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Aman‚Äôu‚Äôllah Farahmandnia 3225 Markway Rd. Toledo, Ohio 43606 March 19, 2009 The Government of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Ireland His honorable and great Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Brian Cowen, and Stephen Harper: Please kindly grant my warmest greetings, highest respect, and sincerity. I would like to share my good thoughts with your majesty on the very important issue of the Constitution in any society and about the disorder, dysfunctional, messed up, screwed up, most corrupted, most untrustworthy, and dangerous government of the United States in the twenty first century that will be very helpful in your lofty Leadership for the dear people of your country, avoiding another disaster to happen in your dear country, and making the World a better, peaceful, and friendlier place for all. The Constitution in any society is the foundation and standard of the people and country; it is a yardstick for keeping everything in harmony and functional system of government for the good of the people in which everyone is treated the same under the law where there is not going to be double standard such one law for the members of the government and another law for the citizen; this is the beauty of the promise of the democracy. There is nothing more dangerous than losing good consciousness and rationalization in any society and that is the state of the so called the government by the people for the people of the United States. The worst is that so called the great Democratic and supper power in the world the Government of the United States, the 530 members Congress, and the Supreme Court of the United States have been silent and sometimes part of the cover ups of the biggest fraud of the Presidential Election and dare not to do anything about it but bended their knees to the violator of law and Constitution the spurious America Barack Obama and this is the sign of great danger of the United States Government in the twenty First Century because the twenty first century government of the United States has no discipline, no standard, no accountability, no responsibility, disobey the rule of law and Constitution, and they do anything as long as it feels good and serves their interests regardless of their action being right or wrong, moral or immoral, just or unjust, lawful or unlawful, ethical or unethical, good or bad and this is the sign of great danger. Example of their irrational behavior is their preplanned of the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York on September 11, 2001 killing thousands of innocent American blamed it on their agents Bin Laden and Al Qaeda to start war in Iraq for controlling Iraqi oil in violation of the United Nations Charter and based on lies, forged document, and misleading; then planned to cause another major catastrophe much greater than disaster of September 11, 2001 in Great Britain and in the United States in July 2006 in which I detected it and averted their evil plot ( Please kindly read the enclosed letter August 11, 2006 to the Leaders of the World), the fraud in the Presidential Election of 2000, and now Barack Obama the Con Artist of all time who was born in Kenya, is citizen of the country of Indonesia, forged document, misled and deceived the voters and public by concealing the truth of his birthplace for more than 20 months, and fooled the members of the Congress, Supreme Court, and the Democratic Party, disrespected the rule law and Constitution by defying the ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States and elected to the highest office of the land illegally and unconstitutionally and the government of the United States the so called the super power of the World is very weak, in state of disarray, powerless, and disorder in such they cannot even follow their own rule of law but they wish to impose their Will and their rotten democracy on others and to be Leader of the World. There is a very serious question of the security system in the United States! I wrote in my letter of January 3, 2009 to the Leaders of the Congress and Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States as, ‚ÄúIt seems that the former Senator Barack Obama managed to fool the members of the Congress, Supreme Court, misled the voters, and the Democratic Party, disrespected the rule law and Constitution knowingly in order to be elected to the office of the President. I assure your honorable that I will not be fooled nor my integrity will be sold for any amount of gold and silver and will publish a book on Presidential Election of 2008 based on every letters that I have written on this matter to educate the American hardworking taxpayers who are paying for this government to be their representative and law abiding citizen as they are.‚Äù I wrote in my letter of January 5, 2009 to the chief Justice of the Supreme Court John G. Roberts as, ‚ÄúYour honorable as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States are going to swear in the next President by taking the Oath of "I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." Therefore your honorable has the greatest responsibility of making sure that the next President is eligible and qualified by the Constitution before January 20, 2009 and the Congress have enough time to select the next Vice President otherwise it will undermine the Rule of Law, the Constitution, the uniqueness of the office of the President, the good standing and trustworthiness of the Supreme Court of the United States, the process of Democracy, the leadership and the reliability of the Government of the United States in the World, and will be recorded in the history of the United States that the former Senator Barack Obama with very false credential and very little experience could manage to fool the people, Congress, and the Supreme Court of the United States to be elected into the highest office of the country illegally therefore please follow the Constitution without any concern but with openness of making it public that the America will know better the law and responsibility of being a good citizen that is in honoring the highest document of the country the Constitution. Thank you for your caring, wisdom, Leadership, and trueness.‚Äù I wrote in my letter of January 29, 2009 to the United States Government as, ‚ÄúThe honorable Chief Justice John Roberts made a very good effort going to the White House for making sure the Oath was taking by the ineligible President elect accurately and rightly for the second time but he has failed to fulfill his Constitutional responsibility making sure that the Presidential elect was qualified before taking the Oath therefore the Chief justice should take the responsibility of correcting for damaging the Constitution by admitting publicly having made mistake for not following the Constitution and nullifying the swearing of the unqualified President elect Barack Obama to the Office of the President of the United States otherwise Chief Justice John Roberts must resign from the Supreme Court for falling short of your responsibility of defending, protecting, and preserving the Constitution of the United States.‚Äù I wrote in my letter of February 3, 2009 to the wrongly elected President Barack Obama as, ‚ÄúPlease kindly tell the truth to the American people, stop playing game, resign today better than tomorrow, and believe it is not funny! Why do you wish to be the cause of the ills of the country, trashing the highest document of the country the Constitution and undermining the rule of law, disobeying and dishonoring the Founding Fathers of the Constitution and great United States?‚Äù I wrote in my letter of March 14, 2009 to the Senator John Kerry as, ‚ÄúConstitution in any society is the highest Rule of Law and guarantees that everyone is treated the same under the law.

The very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish government presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the established government.‚Äù Otherwise I will educate the leaders of the World and the people of the World about the real danger of the United States government in the twenty first century. Thank you for your caring, good understanding, cooperation, and positive response. I wish your majesty, your lovely families, and the good people of your dear country the best of everything, a very good and healthy life, and happiness. May the Most Glorious God blesses your majesty and your wonderful family richly, be with you, protect you, and guides your honorable in your good decision making, in your good thoughts and good deeds, in your wise leadership, and in your great responsibilities.

I would like to share my very final thoughts with your honorable, to offer some very good solutions, and to seek your responsible Leadership in resolving the very real problem of the illegally, unconstitutional and very wrongly elected President. As you great Leaders my know, there was not possible for the very ignorant and unpatriotic Barack Obama to win in the Democratic Primary Presidential Election and in the General Election of 2008 if I did not get involved in the Presidential Election of 2008 but I wrote a letter to the unqualified President Candidate two days later on October 27, 2008 after learning on October 25, 2008 about the lawsuit was filed against him on August 21, 2008 for being born in Kenya, citizen of Indonesia, forging document, concealing truth about his true identity‚Ä¶etc in order to test his honesty. I wrote in my letter on October 27, 2008, ‚ÄúPlease kindly unsubscribe me from your mailing list until your honorable clear the matter of eligibility and qualification your Presidential candidacy as it is required to be natural born citizen of the United States. Please kindly see the enclosed letter of October 27, 2008. Thank you‚Ä¶. This is to test your honesty, trueness, and patriotism. I cannot and will not side with anyone and I am impartial on the great value and important of the Constitution of the United States and your honorable are ineligible to be the President of the United States as the honorable Senator John McCain is. Thank you for your cooperation, caring, and valuing the sacred Constitution of the United States highly and proudly.‚Äù I wrote in my letter of January 5, 2009 to the chief Justice of the Supreme Court John G. Roberts as, ‚ÄúYour honorable as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States are going to swear in the next President by taking the Oath of "I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." Therefore your honorable has the greatest responsibility of making sure that the next President is eligible and qualified by the Constitution before January 20, 2009 and the Congress have enough time to select the next Vice President otherwise it will undermine the Rule of Law, the Constitution, the uniqueness of the office of the President, the good standing and trustworthiness of the Supreme Court of the United States, the process of Democracy, the leadership and the reliability of the Government of the United States in the World, and will be recorded in the history of the United States that the former Senator Barack Obama with very false credential and very little experience could manage to fool the people, Congress, and the Supreme Court of the United States to be elected into the highest office of the country illegally therefore please follow the Constitution without any concern but with openness of making it public that the America will know better the law and responsibility of being a good citizen that is in honoring the highest document of the country the Constitution. Thank you for your caring, wisdom, Leadership, and trueness.‚Äù I responded to the letter from Michelle Obama on January 7, 2009 as, ‚ÄúThe very simple question was asked if Barack Obama was born in Kenya or Hawaii and there is a need of simple answer in which he has declined to answer for almost two years. It is about the highest document of the country the Constitution of the United States that has been defended, protected, and preserved for more than 200 years and it is about the highest office of the land the Presidency of the United States where he must meet the very minimum conditions of being natural born citizen, 35 year old, and residence of the United States for fourteen years therefore he must prove that he was born in Hawaii as he has been saying otherwise he must resign for the position of the President elect soon today better than tomorrow otherwise I have nothing to do with Democratic Party anymore and please unsubscribe me from your email lists as I have written in my letter of October 27, 2008, ‚ÄúPlease kindly unsubscribe me from your mailing list until your honorable clear the matter of eligibility and qualification your Presidential candidacy as it is required to be natural born citizen of the United States. Please kindly see the enclosed letter of October 27, 2008. Thank you. One of the great sign and qualification of the good leader is honesty and the second sign is to deal with the problem as soon as it made public and to admit and apologize for the mistake and wrong has been done unfortunately the former Senator Barack Obama has been dishonest with the America and has no guts to tell the truth about his birthplace therefore he is unqualified to be President for no one is above the law and Constitution in the democratic society and former Senator Barack Obama should declare publicly if he consider himself to be above the law and Constitution. Thank you. ‚Äú I wrote in my letter of January 29, 2009 to the Vice President Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. Vice President, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Chief Justice John Roberts as, ‚ÄúI do not understand why some members of the United States Government are so much interested in doing wrong, violating the rule of law, and the Constitution in which by its term have been elected! There is nothing more dangerous than losing a good consciousness and rationalization in any society and that is the state of the so called the Government by the people for the people of the United States.‚Äù I responded to the letter from President Barack Obama on of February 3, 2009 as, ‚ÄúDear very wrongly, ineligible, disqualified, undeserved, unpatriotic, un-American, and most dishonest former Senator Barack Obama: Please kindly tell the truth to the American people, stop playing game, resign today better than tomorrow, and believe me it is not funny! Why do you wish to be the cause of the ills of the country, trashing the highest document of the country the Constitution and undermining the rule of law, disobeying and dishonoring the Founding Fathers of the Constitution and great United States? Why did you start this mess and why do wish to prolong this unnecessary and not needed problem for the country, government, court system, and the Office of the President of the United States? I have no respect for who does not respect the Rule of Law and Constitution.‚Äù I wrote a letter on March 19, 2009 to the Leaders of the Government of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Ireland. Please kindly read the enclosed letter March 19, 2009 and August 11, 2006. The very best solution to the unconstitutional and unlawfully elected President Barack Obama is that he finally put the interest of the county above his selfish and unworthy interest and to be honest with the American by admitting have done mistakes and made bad judgment or for any personal reason to resign soon from the position of the Presidency because he is only responsible for causing this unnecessary problem and mess for the Democratic Party and the country. The second solution is that your honorable straightforwardly and directly demanding his explanation of not answering to the deadline of December 1, 2008 by the Supreme Court based on the lawsuit was filed against him on October 30, 2008 or assign someone to ask him publicly how could he be President and not to be honest with the America people by not opening his birth certificate and travel document to the public as the great and patriotic Senator McCain has done during the Presidential Election of 2008 and has not answered to lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court. The Third solution is that the honorable Chief Justice John Roberts take the responsibility by admitting for his failure of fulfilling his Constitutional responsibility knowingly and to resign since the lawsuit was filed against Presidential Candidate Barack Obama on October 30, 2008 and the Supreme Court requested his response by December 1, 2008 in which he refused to answer and the Chief Justice John Roberts has been informed well before swearing Barack Obama unconstitutionally on January 20, 3009 and January 22, 2009 in the White House that will make it easier to impeach the most dishonest and wrongly elected President Barack Obama. Fourth solution is that I will educate first every Leader of the World then I will hold a news conference, and will publish my books about the biggest fraud Presidential Election of 2008 and about the disaster of September 11, 2001 and illegal war in Iraq that will end once and for all this matter of cover up, secrecy, and double standard law one for the wealthy and well connected individuals and another law for the hardworking American who are paying for this government therefore I welcome you great, well educated, and experienced Leaders to be more responsible and take your assignment and duty seriously by upholding, honoring, defending, preserving, and respecting the Constitution of the United States as it has been done for more than 200 years otherwise you have done great disservice to the citizen and country of the United States that we all love dearly. I am willing to put this matter in rest and not publishing either of my books about the biggest fraud Presidential Election of 2008 and about the disaster of September 11, 2001 and illegal war in Iraq provided that your honorable to remove unqualified and unconstitutional President Barack Obama from the office of the President by his resignation or process of impeachment for I do care for the wellbeing of the people and United States and expect much more from your honorable not less. Thank you. Dear honorable and patriotic citizen and Leaders, There is no point of covering up the very wrongdoers at the very high cost for the people and the beautiful America that your honorable, members of the Congress, and Supreme Court of the United States are working very hard day and night to make the America better, greater, respectful, and example of great democratic society in the world and knowing that the 530 members of the Congress and millions of America are much more qualified than unpatriotic, un-America, misleader, deceiver, phony, and undeserved Barack Obama who was wrong from the beginning as he is now. I wish your honorable and your lovely families the very best of everything, a very good health and happiness. May the Love and the Blessing of the Most High God fill in your heart, in your house, in your life, and makes every day your life joyful, delightful, peaceful, and thankful. May the Omnipotent God bless your honorable and your dear families richly, be with you, protect you, and guides your honorable in your wise decision making, in your good thoughts and good deeds, in your lofty leadership, and in your great responsibility. My prayers are with your honorable, with your sweet families, and with the kind and noble people of the beautiful America. Have a pleasant, enjoyable, wonderful Wednesday, tranquil Thursday, fabulous Friday, splendid Saturday, spectacular Sunday, and much better week, With best wishes, prayers, beautiful thoughts, and love Thankfully Yours, Aman'u'llah Farahmandnia Aman'u'llah Farahmandnia 3225 Markway Rd. Toledo, Ohio 43606 August 11, 2006 RE: My letters of August 9, 5, 3, and July 28, 25, 2006. August 12, 2006 Additional very important facts. The great, wise, and wonderful Leaders of the world. Please kindly grant my warmest greetings, highest respect, and sincerity. I would like to share my very true thoughts with your honorable on the very dangerous and most professional terrorists individuals who had planned to cause another catastrophe in United Kingdom and United States in last week much greater than the disaster of September 11, 2001 in New York that will be very valuable in your lofty leadership and better understanding of the great danger is facing the world today and using your authority and responsibility in eliminating this real problem before they cause another calamity. The criminal President George W. Bush, Prime Minister Tony Blair, Prime Mister Ehud Olmert, some members of the CIA, British Intelligence Agencies, and Israeli Intelligence Agencies had planned to cause another disaster worse than disaster of September 11, 2001 by putting more than twenty people in ten planes and blowing them up and blame it on terrorists as they did in September 11, 2001 in which they put four bombs in four planes and two bombs in the base of the twin Towers of the World Trade Center and blamed it on Bin Laden in which I detected their most evil plot and averted it. Please kindly let me explain. Thank you. The illogical Prime Minister Tony Blair suddenly decided going to Washington to meet President George W. Bush on Friday July 28, 2006 after I wrote my letter of July 28, 2006. The two very dangerous leaders put their stupid minds together to cause another disaster instead of waking up from their madness; they have been planning for wars, chaos, bombing, and killing innocent people and wish to remain President, Prime Minster, and Leader! What have they benefited for killing Princess Diana, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, thousands of innocent people on September 11, 2001, hundreds of thousands of innocent people in two wars on Iraq, much suffered Palestinian people, and in Lebanon that they wanted to cause another tragedy? They planned to cause another disaster and turmoil in order to eliminate me in which they set up Korean pastor Yongjin Kim who was going with his daughter on trip to Africa on August 2, 2006 to take me to Detroit Airport to put me on plane to New York to visit my good friends in which I knew about their evil plan and refused to go. Then instructed the retired Korean pastor Kim Andre who came from Detroit with his wife to preach on Sunday August 6, 2006 after I wrote my letter of August 5, 2006 to take me to Detroit Airport to put me on the plane going to New York to visit my good friends but I knew about their terrorist plan and avoided it. Then, the instructed some of my friends in Toledo, Ohio who tried to take me to Detroit Airport on Wednesday night of August 9, 2006 and Thursday morning of August 10, 2006 after I wrote my letter of August 9, 2006 in which I knew about their wicked plan and I told them that I would not leave city of Toledo and avoided their most evil plan against many thousands of innocent people and myself but my good friends did not know what my enemies had planned against me and many other innocent people. Their prime goal was to put me on the plane to eliminate me in order to cover up their crimes against American, British, and people of the World. Please carefully note: It was reported in the Detroit Free Press Newspaper on August 11, 2006 as, ( Peter Clarke, London‚Äôs top counterterrorism police officer, said that some event or development late Wednesday convinced British counterterrorism that they must move quickly to thwart a conspiracy with what he called ‚Äú global dimensions.‚Äù) They instructed Abdel-Rahman, a Gama'a spiritual leader who is jailed in the United States after being convicted on charges linked to the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 to join al Qaeda and their agent al Qaeda which was reported in the news on August 5, 2006 as, DUBAI AFP 06/08/2006 - Al-Qaeda second in command Ayman al-Zawahiri announced that a string of key players from Egypt's Jamaa Islamiya militant group were joining the global terror network, in a taped message aired by Arabic television Al-Jazeera. In the message, the Egyptian-born Zawahiri welcomed "a number" of the Jamaa Islamiya's leadership "under the al-Qaeda banner." "Among them are Omar Abdel Rahman, Abu Khalil al-Hakayma, Mohammed al-Islambuli, Refaa Taha et Mohammed Mustafa al-Mokri," said Zawahiri. They have decided to "merge with al-Qaeda to unite the forces of the (Muslim) nation into one, to face its enemies which are launching the most ferocious campaign ever seen against Islam," he said. CAIRO (AP) ‚Äî Al-Qaeda's No. 2 leader said in a new videotape aired Saturday that an Egyptian militant group has joined the terror network. It was the first time that al-Qaeda has announced a branch in Egypt, the Arab world's most populous nation. The Egyptian group, Gamaa Islamiya, is apparently a revived version of a militant group of the same name that waged a campaign of violence in Egypt during the 1990s but was crushed in a government crackdown. "We announce to the Islamic nation the good news of the unification of a great faction of the knights of the Gamaa Islamiya... with the al-Qaeda group," Ayman al-Zawahri said in the videotape aired on the Al-Jazeera news network. Omar Abdel Rahman Zawahiri says Egyptian group's leaders have joined al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda second in command Ayman al-Zawahiri announced that a string of key players from Egypt's Jamaa Islamiya militant group were joining the global terror network, in a taped message aired by Arabic television Al-Jazeera.) It was reported in the news on August 10, 2006 as, (Police statement: Homes and businesses across England are being searched and 21 people questioned after police say a plot to blow up planes from the UK to US was disrupted. And US Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said the plot was "in some respects suggestive of al-Qaeda". Security chiefs, who had had the group under surveillance for some time, said they were close to putting their plan - which police said would have caused "mass murder on an unimaginable scale" - into action. Sources in the UK have confirmed that they believe an attack may have been imminent - possibly in the next few days. "They had accumulated and assembled the capabilities that they needed and they were in the final stages of planning for execution," Mr. Chertoff said. Security experts believe they planned to detonate liquid explosives on up to nine planes. They would have smuggled it on board hidden in drinks, electronic devices and other "common objects". He said had the plot been successful, it would have meant "loss of life on an unprecedented scale". Prime Minister Tony Blair, on holiday in the Caribbean, paid tribute to the police and the security services. LONDON (Reuters) - British police arrested 21 people and ordered tough security measures on Thursday that brought chaos to airports, saying they had foiled a plot to blow up several aircraft flying over the Atlantic Ocean. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said the plot was in the final stages of planning before execution. Mr. Chertoff said that while the investigation had been pursued by British authorities "for some considerable period of time"; it had only been within the last two weeks that the plot had taken the direction of targeting the United States. By last night, he said, the potential attackers "had accumulated and assembled the capabilities they needed, and were in the final stages of planning for execution". While the British home secretary, John Reid, declined to give any details of the identities of the 21 people arrested in overnight raids in the UK, the first clues began to emerge in the US. The terrorism expert Peter Bergen told CNN he understood the detainees to be Britons of Pakistani descent. British police arrested 21 people in connection with the plot on Thursday. Sarkozy also said that France would order full searches of all handluggage on flights to the United States, Britain and Israel as part of stepped up security after the foiled plot. WASHINGTON - The terrorist attack foiled by British authorities on Thursday was aimed at blowing up as many as 10 airplanes on trans-Atlantic flights, and plotters had hoped to stage a dry run within two days, U.S. intelligence officials said. One official said the suicide attackers planned to use a peroxide-based solution that could ignite when sparked by a camera flash or another electronic device. "This was a well-advanced plan," Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told reporters as British authorities announced the arrests of 24 alleged plotters. "In some respects suggestive of an al-Qaida plot." Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said as many as 10 flights had been targeted. White House spokesman Tony Snow said President Bush had been briefed in advance of the events, and had approved raising the alert to red on flights from England. Senior lawmakers also received advance word. Several said they had been briefed by Homeland Security or CIA officials as early as Monday.) It was reported in the news on August 11, 2006 as, (‚ÄúPut simply, this was a plot to commit mass murder on an unimaginable scale.‚Äù Said Paul Stephenson, deputy commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police, describing a plot that if successful could have could have rivaled the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in deaths toll. The plot ‚Äúwas sophisticated, it had a lot of members and it was international in scope.‚Äù Mr. Chertoff said. It was reported in the news on August 11, 2006 that Michael Jackson Deputy Secretary at the Department for Homeland Security ‚ÄúThe real focus was to blow up airlines and the people on them.‚Äù It was reported in the news on August 11, 2006 that irresponsible President George W. Bush said, ‚ÄúThis nation is at war with Islamic fascists who use any means to destroy those of us who love freedom to hurt our nation. The American people need to know we live in a dangerous world. But our government will do everything we can to protect our people from those dangers.‚Äù Please kindly note: With a close examination of what has been reported in the news on their despicable plot, one can see easily that they had still planned to cause a disgusting tragedy in the coming (weeks, this month.) by keeping their terrorists agents at large that I decided to write your honorable to stop their insanity. Dear honorable great leaders and good citizen of the world. The same terrorists who were responsible for the Disaster of September 11, 2001 planned to blow up ten planes in the last two weeks but they failed to complete their foolish plan because I did not fall in their traps and this is the truth. I wish your honorable and your dear family the very best of everything, a very good health and happiness. May the Love and the Blessing of the Most Holy God fill in your heart, in your house, in your life, and makes every day your life joyful, cheerful, and thankful. May the Most Loving God bless your honorable and your sweet family richly, be with you, protect you, and guides your honorable in your superb leadership, in your good vision, and in your great responsibility. My prayers are with your honorable, with your lovely family, and with the kind and noble people of your beautiful country. Have a pleasant, enjoyable, fantastic Friday, splendid Saturday, and sweet Sunday. Thankfully Yours, Aman'u'llah Farahmandnia

Dear Senator Clary and Governor Perdue,

I am contacting concerning the cut in funds to the North Carolina Schools. The school system I am familiar with is the Gaston County Schools. Last year cuts were made and teachers jobs were lost. In the upcoming year they are facing more job cuts. They will probably have to pay for their own insurance in the coming year. My wife and many other teachers do their job because they love it, if not they could make more money in other positions. I just found out that they probably will not be getting their longevity pay this year which is something that all teachers work forward to. My wife would have been actually getting this pay for the first time this year.

The way I see it we are cutting our own throats. Teachers are already underpaid in this and most states. They are the ones responsible for shaping the minds and hearts of our youth today. Even more so today as many parents do not find the time to teach their children the necessary things they should learn at home. I donít know how many cuts and how much more stress they can be expected to take. People do not know the stress and anxiety most teachers are under. In many schools they are running out of the basic supplies they need to teach even down to reams of paper.

I donít know if there is anything that either of you can do about this but I had to bring it to your attention. If we keep taking benefits and things away from our teachers we will eventually only get those teach who can do nothing else and who care little for our children. As you know teachers are already expected to be mom, dad, therapist, doctors, social workers and so many other things. If you can please help. I know this is hard economic times and everyone is making cuts. I know some are needed and many are using the present economy as an excuse. I also know there were many funds allocated by President Obamaís bailout plans that were received by North Carolina. Thanks in advance.

Subject: Example of Banks causing Economic Crisis and Chaos

Comment: (Open Letter to NC North Carolina General Assembly, Lawmakers, Public Officials and the Press) Carolina First is an Example of Banks causing Economic Crisis and Chaos instead of helping to solve them. We all have heard: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The banks don‚Äôt understand this. They are spending and wasting hundreds of pounds of taxpayer‚Äôs dollars when ounces of common sense would work much better. While the public, lawmakers and the world struggle with economic recovery, Carolina First Bank (Parent company The South Financial Group) is creating new economic crisis and chaos that tax payers are paying for. If you will take a few minutes to understand this transaction it will make your head spin. It will turn on very bright lights to understand how the banks are creating economic chaos and crisis using taxpayer‚Äôs money. I would welcome the opportunity to appear before any committee at anytime at my expense to show how daily decisions (no common sense decisions) by bankers (from the president of the banks down to the VPs‚Äô) are destroying all efforts of economic recovery. The banks own systems are causing an implosion while bank executives are self blinded and made secured by the public‚Äôs deposits and taxpayer backed bailout. Carolina First‚Äôs parent company The South Financial Group recently appeared in the paper ‚Äúsuits were filed over Whittle's (the company former CEO) original $18 million retirement package. The suits said Whittle's benefits were too lucrative and his date to step aside was accelerated to help the bank get federal bailout money.‚Äù For credibility please check out my credentials at my website www.defalco.com. I plan to use this situation with Carolina First (true example) on a state level as well as on the national level. Last week I had the opportunity to meet with U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid at a private gathering in my home state Florida. He has listened with open ears and has followed up as promised within 4 days of our meeting. He has me in touch with the right person on his staff. For credibility I have attached a photo of myself with Senator Harry Reid taken last week. I will be flying to Washington within the next few weeks once the meetings with the right people are confirmed. In spite of a 347 million dollar government infusion (bailout money) to Carolina First‚Äôs parent company The Southern Group, bank officials (any of them) REFUSES to meet with me, a customer (Floridian) who is operating a viable business in Buncombe County, North Carolina since March 2006. I have provided $300,000 ++ in profits to Carolina First since March 2006 and it is well documented (verified) that I have taken 00000 dollars from the existing business in 3 years. In fact, Carolina First is suing me to take possession/control of the property and business that I have invested over $200,000+++ and 3 years of my time. They are trying to take possession of a very idiosyncratic business and property they have no knowledge of and have never set foot on. I have tried for 5 months to get bank officials (anyone) to meet me at the property/business to understand why and how their involvement will ruin the business and the value of the property by a minimum of 50-60%. Instead of granting me a face to face business (common sense) meeting to work out a feasible plan they hide behind their attorney (great cost to them) and the court system (great cost to the NC taxpayers). They have forced me to defend; using monies (cash flow-$12,000 per month) from the business that could be paid to the bank, now it must be used for legal defense. They received 347 million dollars from the government and are using funds to sue a good (profitable) customer and cost taxpayers thousands of dollars inundating the court system. After their 3rd attempt to force me out of business in North Carolina I appealed to the president of the bank Scott Frierson who has not returned one phone call or answered any of my email. My only request was for them to meet me to mediate (common sense) a feasible resolution to save the business, investors, and employees. Carolina First has 10 pages of bank owned properties, from North Carolina to Florida on their web site http://carolinafirst.com/property/default.aspx. As I have previously written them in the past they should be consulting with me to help them out of their mess, not suing me to get another business/property. I have been a customer with Carolina First for 3 years and they have received $323,000 in profits from my business, yet they refuse to allow me a face to face business (common sense) meeting. Through their attorney they sent a plan (made up in 10 minutes after one hearing they dragged me to) that would put the NC Company out of business within 90-120 days. I traveled from Florida and asked their attorney to arrange a face to face meeting, but they refused. I asked them to meet and go see the business and property which they have $1,350,000 invested, they refused. One very key person involved in the business (and has lived on the property for many years) is dying of cancer and they have totally ignored this fact. There are funds in the bank to work out a feasible plan (economic recovery) for the business and property but now must go to legal expense. The business/property generates $12,000-$15,000 per month. A face to face (common sense) meeting is needed to understand the asset and how easy it would be to make the business and property work for the bank and all involved. A common sense meeting would strengthen the taxpayer‚Äôs 347 million dollar infusion versus wasting it on legal expense and devaluating the bank‚Äôs collateral. The bank‚Äôs litigation (if successful) will cost the bank a minimum loss of $500,000-$700,000. This is a crazy and insane business decision (at taxpayer‚Äôs expense) when the bank has been receiving over $100,000 per year in profits from me as a customer. At this time I am only asking for one thing: That you use your influence to ask the bank to use common sense and set up a meeting to resolve this matter and stop using the taxpayer‚Äôs monies unwisely in the court system. It is taxpayer‚Äôs money that is paying for the court system and it is taxpayer‚Äôs money being used (347 million) to pay their attorney. It will be a cost of $500,000-$700,000 of taxpayer‚Äôs money if they force the company to file bankruptcy which we will be forced to do if they insist on taking this business/property over. I have over 60 pages of backup to this situation but did not want to overwhelm you at this first writing; hopefully I will succeed to get the press in publishing all the facts. I have copied everyone involved in this matter on this email. When you reply, please reply to all with your advice, opinions and assistance offered if any.

Subject: The state of NC

Comment: Ms. Perdue, I am wondering if you are wanting the farmer of this state to leave and start their business overseas. After the tobacco buy-out there were a lot of farmers that quit farming. However, there a still a lot that make a living from tobacco. Once the government was not in on the amount that a farmer could produce, then all of the "No Smoking" begin. First it started at the school, which in the last 20 years students were not to be smoking at the school but now the adults are not allowed. Do you have any idea where the name of Winston and Salem cigarettes came from? Next, was the buildings owned by the government, ok, I guess I can understand that, but now you are going to control what a private business has the right to do by banning smoking in all public places? Is the outside going to become a public place also. Ms. Perdue, My husband and his brother are small farmer compared to others, however, we filter through Surry County about two hundred thousand dollars a year, and that is just US. I sure that may not sound like a lot to you but I believe for ONE OUTFIT to produce that type of revenue is fairly impressive. You may not realize that a lot of people STILL depend of the "sweat of their brow" to make a living, everyone can not nor have the desire to go to college, we HAVE to have laborers in this state and every other state. When RJ Reynolds packs up and leaves, then what? Winston Salem NC becomes the ghost town like so many others or are you going to put ANOTHER office there. Whether you can control it or not people ARE not impaired while driving in their vehicles and smoking and if you are concerned about their families, well I believe that is their business. If you are in a public place, i.e. restaurant or bar YOU can decide to leave if you do not like smoking. My daughter (12 years old at the time) went to an event at Greensboro and she noticed the "No Smoking" signs and no re-entry, but yet folks were allowed to drink alcohol and leave there, she questioned me about it and of course, I said a sign of the times. She remarked but why is it that people can not leave and smoke if they want and come back in, but they can drink alcohol and get behind the wheel with the possibility of NOT getting caught before they kill someone like her or themselves but yet tobacco is still legal?

Heck, Guv - -

I ain't even rich or smart, but writer Bass IMO done opened 2 areas of humongous & dramatic savings
of taxpayers' funds (jes' to mention only 2) - - tho' one would add to the unemployment rate of 10%+ . . . .

a) Replace AG's staff with a buyer (preferably a green shade CPA!) of outside legal services;
b) Outsource internal auditor (y'all do got one?) job to Fern Shubert. Or Pat Stith. Or Ann Ryder.
Or maybe to Carolina Journal's Don Carrington or Mr Bass . . . .

Er, build a bit of internal monitoring, accountability into state gov't ops.

Of course, getting hearing ears into NCGA Oligarkhs another challenge! Voters control that  :'(
& then the members who keep bowing 'n scrapin' - - instead of setting off resounding, crashing waves . . . .

Warm good wishes for citizens-serving gov't!

Subject: NC Needs Smoke-free

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: As your constituent, I urge you to support House Bill 2/Senate Bill 205, legislation that will make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. Please keep the bill strong in its proposed form without amendments. Exposure to secondhand smoke is a health hazard that causes or makes worse a wide range of adverse health effects, including heart attacks, cancer, and asthma. I believe that all workers should be protected from secondhand smoke in the workplace. My support for a smoke-free environment is not in the minority. North Carolinians are voicing their support for smoke-free policies. According to an Elon University poll in 2006, 86 percent of North Carolinians agree or strongly agree that employees in North Carolina should be able to work in a smoke-free environment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that as little as 30 minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. No one should have to risk their life to keep a job. Non-smokers routinely exposed to secondhand smoke have a 50% increase in risk of developing lung cancer. By helping to prohibit smoking in public places and worksites, you will play an important role in ensuring an immediate and dramatic impact on the health of everyone living and visiting our Tarheel state. In addition to saving lives, smoke-free policies save health care costs. A recent study in Pueblo, Colorado found the rate of heart attacks declined 41% after a smoke-free law went into effect. Not only did fewer people have heart attacks, but this had a rippling effect on public and private health care costs. We can't afford to wait any longer to breathe smoke-free indoor air. I urge you to vote yes for HB 2 and keep this legislation strong in its proposed form without amendments. Sincerely, Ben Brinson 1063 Lake Royale Louisburg, NC 27549-7028

Subject: State Employees Health Insurance

Comment: Good Morning, 1. Health Care for State and Retirees: To help with the budget, have the committee considered..employees share the cost of their health care payments....instead of free for the worker. This would help a great deal and everyone would benefit. 2. State Retirees double dipping....They choice to retire (thanks), but comes back to work in same field (ex. teachers) or other jobs with the state. Come on give another person the chance to work. 3. Stimulus monies from Washington let's make sure that an oversight committee is appointed "to watch like an eagle", that the monies are used as designed....not to pay for studies or top executive salaries. There are alot of people in our state without jobs. Thank you

Governor Announces Members of Budget Reform and Accountability Commission

Gov. Perdue this week announced the initial membership of her Budget Reform and Accountability Commission. The members will serve with co-chairs Norris Tolson and Hilda Pinnix-Ragland to help Perdue locate and eliminate wasteful expenditures while increasing efficiency in government.
ìThe leaders I have chosen have expertise in the public and private sectors. This group can help me root out inefficient spending and outdated programs and bring greater accountability to state government,î said Perdue. ìI look forward to working closely with the BRAC team to make sure our taxpayersí dollars are being used wisely and efficiently.î
The commissionís first task will be to conduct a detailed review of the stateís entire continuation budget to identify inefficiencies and develop options for cuts and consolidations.
The commission members include:
Co-chair Norris Tolson ñ Retired executive with E.I. Dupont; former Secretary of the North Carolina Departments of Revenue, Transportation and Commerce; and the current president and CEO of the North Carolina Biotechnology Center.
Co-chair Hilda Pinnix-Ragland ñ Vice-president of corporate public affairs with Progress Energy and chair of the State Board of Community Colleges.
Norma Houston ñ Lecturer in public law and government at the UNC-CH School of Government; former chief of staff and general counsel to State Senate President Pro Tempore Marc Basnight; and former assistant attorney general in the N.C. Department of Justice.
Dan Gerlach ñ Former senior budget advisor to Governor Mike Easley and the current president of the North Carolina Golden LEAF Foundation.
Curtis Clark ñ Former executive director of the North Carolina Statewide Performance Audit (GPAC); former deputy state controller for information resource management; former director of the Performance Audit Division of the North Carolina State Auditorís Office; and the current Global Director for Regional and Local Government with IBM;
Charlie Sanders ñ Chair of the National Institute of Health and retired CEO & chair of Glaxo, Inc.
Ron Penny ñ Former director of the North Carolina Office of State Personnel and current professor and chair of the Department of Public Administration at North Carolina Central University and assistant to the university provost.

$56 Million for National Guard Facility

Gov. Bev Perdue announced†Wednesday that work will begin shortly on a $56 million new North Carolina National Guard Joint Force Headquarters facility that will also house offices of the state Division of Emergency Management, the State Highway Patrol and the Department of Transportation in Raleigh.† The project, which is expected to create up to 4,200 jobs, will be open to bids next week with work to start as soon as early summer and to be finished within two years.
In addition to the National Guard, the facility will provide the main offices for North Carolinaís Emergency Management division, communications for the state Department of Transportation and the triangle area communications center of the Highway Patrol.† About $41.5 million in federal funding for the facility was included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.† The remaining money comes from state general and highway trust funds that had previously been set aside for the project.
ìThis project is big a win for North Carolina.† It provides a state of the art facility that will better coordinate key state services and is ready to put people to work in much needed jobs,î Gov. Perdue said.
Securing money for this project was a top priority for Gov. Perdue, who personally discussed it with President Barack Obama and with North Carolinaís congressional delegation.† Fourth Congressional District Rep. David Price was instrumental in boosting the funding for the Army National Guard account in the federal recovery legislation.†
The new 237,000 square-foot facility will be located on an 18-acre site off of District Drive in Raleigh.† The existing facility will continue to be used by current National Guard offices now housed in temporary trailers.† Since September 2001, units of the N.C. National Guard have been continuously mobilized throughout the world.
The transition of the National Guard from a strategic reserve to an operational reserve requires more facilities to meet the increased service demands.† Also, bringing agencies that consistently work together under one roof, will streamline coordination and provide for more effective emergency response.
<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=218>

First Recovery Contracts Awarded

Work†will begin in April on the stateís first nine highway and bridge projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The contracts total $36.3 million and were awarded this week by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidders, as required by state law.
ìThese first road projects will create a wide range of jobs throughout North Carolina and can address some of our most pressing, ready-to-go infrastructure needs,î Perdue said.
The projects are located in Brunswick, Camden, Currituck, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Scotland and Stanly counties. Two projects, one located in Alamance County and one in Forsyth/Stokes counties, were let to contract on March 17 and will be awarded once the respective low bidders demonstrate that they have met ìgood faith effortî requirements in attempting to reach the disadvantaged business enterprise goals set forth in the contracts. The disadvantaged business enterprise goals were met or exceeded on the nine contracts awarded.
The bids received on all 11 economic recovery projects let to contract in March came in more than 19 percent, or nearly $15.8 million, below NCDOT estimates. Work on all contracts can start as soon as April 27, with the exception of the Currituck County bridge replacement project, which will begin after June 30th.†
According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation trickles down into the economy six times.
In addition to helping create jobs, the nine projects awarded will complete needed infrastructure improvements. They include four widening projects that will help improve mobility and reduce congestion; three construction projects that will extend key corridors and provide regional access; and two bridge replacement projects, one of which will replace the stateís fourth oldest bridge still in use.
For more information about recovery funding for infrastructure improvements in North Carolina, as well as other NCDOT projects and activities, visit <http://www.ncdot.gov/>www.ncdot.gov.

Subject: NC Budget

Comment: I realize that the budget issues facing the state of North Carolina are tough. When we look at educator salaries, it certainly hits home with me. The 1.8 percent raise seems to cost the same as the small teacher bonus given based on years of service. When you are in the last couple of years of 30 plus years to education, this really hurts since it does affect the total salary and retirement figures. Please explain how I am going to do with this change. I have 30 years but plan to work two or three more years. With the freeze, and not receiving this small amount ($3,000.00) for me compared to $1,110.00 with a 1.8 percent raise. More important to me and many other educators with retirement close, it has a long term affect that will cost us hundreds and thousands of dollars. Since I did vote for Beth Perdue, it makes me want to re-consider (but it is too late for 2008) my voting. A good explanation would be helpful and an understanding why Beth Perdue would want to take money from the people that have spent years in education.

Subject: State Employees

Comment: Why not take 5% of the salary from all state employees who make $75,000 and above? Surely that would generate a tremendous amount of money. It is a compromise that is not as harsh as the taking of the longevity pay. Also it keeps the lower paid state workers from shouldering the burden when some of them are already working two jobs to make ends meet. Even if you set the bar at $50,000 and above, which would include me. I am concerned about the twelve employees that I supervise in the District Attorney's office in the Ninth Prosecutorial District. Some of them are barely making ends meet as it is. The changes in the state health insurance program proposed by Senator Rand are crippling in and of themselves. When all of us leave to find other jobs, who is going to keep state services moving?

Subject: Proposed budget cut for Tertiary Center High Risk Maternity Clinics

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, My name is Janina Dorriety. I am a dietitian at a high-risk maternity clinic in Greenville, North Carolina. The high-risk clinic is a very important part of the health care system in our area. Pitt and twenty-eight other counties, in eastern North Carolina, are serviced by our clinic were maternity patients are referred for consultations and/or transfer of care during their pregnancies. Our state is one that sees child health and efforts for decreasing infant mortality as an important issue, evident from the history of increased funding in these areas. It has come to my attention that a budget has been proposed which will act to no longer fund the high risk maternity clinic here in eastern North Carolina, and in other areas of the state, that are currently being funded through state funds. I feel that this would be doing a terrible disservice to the women of our state and their unborn infants. Cutting back on the availability of quality and specialized care for this at risk population does not service the goal of decreasing infant mortality and increasing quality of child health. Please consider the many women and children that the lack of these specialty clinics will affect. Thank you for your time.

Hello!!

I work at a restaurant and I would love to have a ìSmoke Freeî place to work. I am concerned for my health and my fellow employees.

Please help us with a law, like other states, that bans smoking in restaurants!! I see children trying to eat with 2nd hand smoke all around. We must do something for the majority of the people that are affected by the minority!

Thanks for your time!

Gary Mote

Subject: Teacher raises

Comment: As an educator, I appreciate your support, and I applaud your wish to give us a raise. As an educator, I am concerned that giving educators a raise when all around us are losing their jobs is not necessarily a good thing. I am willing to forgo a raise, and I am willing to be frozen a step for a year or two in order to keep more teachers on the payroll. I am more than sure that the majority of other educators would feel the same way. The money from these moves could go toward funding teaching positions that at this point are on the chopping block. I have to cut 6.5 teachers from my building alone. This will have a severe impact on class sizes, discipline and morale. Although getting a raise is nice, it does not offset the problems that having fewer teachers in the building brings. Thank you for your time.

Please support this Bill for help with our NC beaches.† I beg of you to consider this measure and to also consider Hardened structures for our entire Coast.† I have made this plea before.† We are the only state on the east coast that does not allow this and it puts our coastline at a severe disadvantage.† Jetties in each inlet or at least in every other inlet would prove beneficial for all. This has been proven by the three that are in our Ports.

Please give us a chance.† I know times are tough right now.† Many people losing their jobs.† But there are also many people in danger of losing the only home they have ever known due to events caused by not having hardened structures.† Many have been there more than 30 years.† Please consider this before its too late for so many.†

Thank you

Subject: Longevity

Comment: I have been hearing rumors about longevity being cut out. I have been teaching for 35 years, my husband lost his job last April and I have a son getting ready to go to college in the fall. Cutting out the longevity pay would definitely hurt my family. Health insurance has taken a hefty bite out of my pay, now this. It was hard enough last year only getting a .9% pay raise. Please fight for our longevity. I end up spending a large postion of that on my students every year. Susie Willis

Hi,

I've noticed recently the DOT has planted hundreds of small trees alongside the I-85 corridor through the city of Durham. †These are also planted alongside I-540 in Wake County. †I'm certain these were at no small cost to the State. †

In North Carolina, if you want open land to become re-forested, just don't do anything. †Quit mowing it and in 3 or 4 years, you'll have a nice pine forest at little or no cost to the taxpayers.

thanks,

Mike

Subject: Taxes on cigarettes

Comment: I am a former smoker. However, I cannot beleive the taxes which are being imposed on smokers. Outrageous, to say the least! Why not start taxing all alcoholic beverages, liquor sales, etc. And why you are at it, add a 50 cent tax to every hamburger and order of fries sold - health care in North Carolina would be paid for. Being over weight is as big of a health risk as smoking.

Subject: Cigarette taxes!

Comment: It IS NOT our (the people who smokes) responsibility to pay other peoples health insurance. If you would stop paying for these people to sit around and not work, they would be able to pay their own child‚Äôs insurance and not need support. Maybe you need to focus on something that is really hurting our economy such as these illegal immigrants coming over here and working our jobs. Maybe then you could start fixing this crazy economy. Be reassured that come next election‚Ä¶You will not have my vote. I have not been impressed with anything you have imposed on the American people
