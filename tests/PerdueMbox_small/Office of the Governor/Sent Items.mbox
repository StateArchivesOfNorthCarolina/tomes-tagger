Subject: 2009-2010 Hunting Proposals
First of all I would like to thank you for your time.

Iâ€™m writing in regard to some of the 2009-2010 Hunting proposals.

I have voted but would like to comment on just a couple.

H5 - Extending Muzzleloading a week. I SUPPORT

One of the biggest opponents of this is the North Carolina Bowhunters Association. I understand that it would take a week away from the Archery season but would they feel the same if the roles were reversed, meaning taking a week away from muzzleloading or regular gun season and adding a week to Archery, my guess is NOT. I would personally love to see two weeks of muzzleloading. I know some people that do not hunt muzzleloading season because it was not benificial to purchase a muzzleloader for just one week but have said that if it was extended to two weeks that they would start. I would even be open to taking away week of regular gun season to add the second week of muzzleloading that way the bowhunters would not loose that week.

H28 â€“ Use of Crossbows. I SUPPORT

Just in case you havenâ€™t read the NCBA take on this here it is:

NOTE: NCBA will continue to OPPOSE legalization of crossbows in North Carolina. Currently,  state law forbids anyone from purchasing a crossbow without first obtaining a special permit. There appears to be some problem too with the legal and accepted definition of "archery equipment", of which crossbows do not conform with.
We are not sure the WRC has the legal authority to simply legalize crossbows for hunting. We are checking into this. Also,  the definitions of bows, arrows, etc.,  do not cover the physical characteristics of crossbows, and are not considered "archery equipment", by the accepted definition by experts in the sport. The chairman (Wes Seegars) announced at the Thursday night WRC meeting in Brevard (Oct. 2, 2008) that he had been contacted by the ATA (Archery Trade Association), and that they were "eccstatic" about the possibility of crossbows being legalized in N.C.,  because "They will make a lot of money on the sale of them."  So,  now the WRC is going to support big bow manufacturers making a lot of money, but NOT our local archery dealers, many of whom will lose their businesses and livelihood if these proposals are approved. The NCBA will continue to oppose legalization of crossbows in N.C.  They are NOT bows, and they don't shoot arrows.  They are big and cumbersome to carry around. They are dangerous to use by even a normal man who has no physical impairment. And, they are NOT as easy to use as advertised.  They are NOT as effective and accurate as they are advertised to be. They do NOT belong in bow only seasons for sure, and do NOT need to be legalized in N.C. for anyone other than legitimate handicapped persons,  as the law now provides for.

This response is a complete JOKE. These are very lame excuses not to allow crossbows. I used to bow hunt but hurt my right shoulder and itâ€™s hard for me to pull a bow back but I do not qualify to obtain a license to use a crossbow. The use of crossbows would expand my hunting season again.

Once again thank you for your time.

Clay Benton

	Message: 	Dear Governor Easley,

First, permit me the opportunity to again thank you and your staff for the prompt intervention in the matter of securing my retirement from the state retirement system. I did receive an immediate response from one of the workers with the retirement system regarding this matter. I apologize, but I cannot locate the written information regarding her name. However, I was informed that the process would take one to two weeks to complete. I forwarded this information to Wachovia, my banking institution to handle all processes.

Unfortunately, I must say that I am again puzzled and frustrated because the system is not, in my opinion, fulfilling its promise by professionally corresponding with the Rapid Rollover team at Wachovia handling this matter. I spoke with a Wachovia support representative on Wednesday, the 31st, after receiving a letter from the retirement system asking for written correspondence from Wachovia detailing the acceptance of the rollover. According to Jewnell Provoid, Wachovia Rapid Rollover Team Support at 877-386-2472, extension 058289, several sets of the same information as again requested by the retirement system was sent on 12/18,30,31/08. Fax confirmations were maintained about each correspondence between the two institutions, but the retirement systems continues to request the information again. I do not understand why there is this problem, and feel the retirement system is dragging to prevent the rollover. As stated in a previous email, it is urgent that I receive this money to keep my home.

Please intervene and help me. Feel free to contact me or Mrs. Provoid.

Thank you,
Shirley Vinson

	Message: 	Dear Governor Easley,

Imagine the surprise the Sampson County community had when they read this article in the Sampson Independent, published December 31, 2008. http://www.clintonnc.com/articles/2008/12/31/news/doc495b7c9bc3563737964538.txt

Imagine our further surprise when we read this explanation, “The fiscal department said that until every agency across the state had turned in the reports ‘correctly,’ then no money would be dispersed,” Gonzalez reiterated, adding, “There are a hundred agencies, and if for any reason, just one hasn’t turned it in right, then no one gets paid.”

Now Governor, I ask you, are you running a kindergarten? It certainly seems that you are running your department using kindergarten rules? These are state funds that were applied for and approved by the state for the continued running of domestic violence shelters and clinics throughout the state. These are not cookies to be withheld at snack time because an errant child forgot to wash his hands.

U-Care has filled out the mandatory paperwork, submitted the paperwork on time, and the paperwork is correct and complete. Yet, your Department of Administration (fiscal) is going to withhold desperately needed funds because some other group has not filed theirs correctly? Would this go over well with you if the Internal Revenue Service withheld your personal refund because some man in California didn’t file his taxes correctly? Would you withhold clothes, food and shelter to a group of people in Area A because someone in Area B was not seated? This is exactly what you are doing and in doing so you have shown the Sampson County community that your office implements infantile and childish regulations.

You are familiar with domestic violence. You would have to be in order to function in your job. So, my telling you that every day you withhold the funds that U-Care qualified for and should currently have in hand to operate the shelter with, is a day that you are risking the life of a man, woman or child who is desperate to escape a domestic violence situation is something you should already know. Domestic Violence does not stop because the funding is ceased or delayed. In fact, it escalates. It escalates because there is no one left to stop it. You are also aware that incidents of domestic violence increase with the stress of the holidays, the lack of personal finances (we are in a recession and money is tight at all economic levels) and during times of unemployment (North Carolina reports a 7.9% unemployment rate which is the highest level since 1983). All of these factors are currently in play not only in Sampson County, but throughout the state. Now is not the time t o punish domestic violence victims through the withholding of funds.

There are 100 counties in the state and most counties have a shelter of some type or at least a shelter agreement with a neighboring county. With delayed funding, how many shelters will have to close? How many will have to refer to another county? How many closings will the Department of Administration deem acceptable? Is 1 thru 5% acceptable? How about 15 to 25%? Nothing more than 0% should be acceptable to your office and to the citizens of this state.

U-Care is an essential service in our community and without them I really do not know where I would be. In December 2000 I ran from my abusive husband with two children, two cats and a Golden Retriever. I ended up in Clinton because that is basically where the U-Haul ran out of gas. My family resided at U-Care for 63 days and during that time we were counseled, respected and loved. Since then, with the support of U-Care, I have completed a degree in Criminal Justice and will graduate in May 2009 with a degree in Paralegal Technology. I am 100% certain that my family would not have survived this trauma without the guidance and dedication of this wonderful group of professionals and there is not a day that I don’t recognize their influence on my life and the lives of my children. As such I advocate for this organization whenever I can.

Again, Governor Easley, I cannot emphasize enough how the delay in these funds due U-Care will impact their organization and our community. This delay is literally a recipe for disaster in the making. What happens to that one victim who cannot find help locally? What happens to her children and family if she returns to the home and is beaten, yet again, or shot or murdered? Is the withholding of funds until “everyone does it correctly,” worth that one life?



Thank you,

Janet Rogers

	Message: 	Dear Governor,

My name is Leslie Darrin Lovelace and I am a Rutherford County resident. My employer has sent in benefit claims 3 weeks in a row and I have not received payment. The last payment I received was issued on 12/11 and nothing since. In the meantime, I've had to rely on credit cards which needless to say is increasing my debt. I've contacted all the neccessary people with the ESC both local and Raleigh and getting vague explanations. Please help me in any way you can and I thank you in advance.

Yours Truly,
Leslie Darrin Lovelace

Dear Beverly,

We are North Carolina Falun Dafa Association. We will host the Divine
Performing Arts show (DPA) in North Carolina. This performance will take
place at 7:00 pm on December 28, 2008 in the new Durham Performing Arts
Center. This show is part of the Divine Performing Arts 2009 world tour.
Last year, the show delighted over 600,000 audience in over 60 cities
worldwide. Since 2006, this show has been performed in some of the greatest
venues, including New York City's Radio City Music Hall and San Francisco's
Opera House. You may find more information about DPA show in Durham at the
link http://www.divineshows.com/rtp. We greatly appreciate the
congratulatory letter from the Governor Easley's office for this special
event. We would like to request a brief meeting with Governor Easley. We
want to thank him personally for the letter. Also, we would like to write an
article to the local Chinese newspaper Epoch Times for this event . We would
like to take a picture with Governor Easley. It is greatly appreciated if
you would schedule a 5-minute meeting with Governor Easley. Thank you so
much for your help.

Yours truly,

Kathy Li

I have worked my whole life, never having to collect unemployment. I moved and relocated to this area because I was about to be unemployed in N.Y. State and I didn't want to go through that. I changed my whole life, left my friends and family behind just to work and be able to make ends meet. Now I find myself unemployed and in a whole new life of robbing Pe ter to pay Paul. Although I am looking for a job, my problem now is collecting the unemployement that I am entitled to. I was on the phone for 1 hour on hold from The employment commision in hopes of speaking to a person about my claim and why I havent received a check. The reason I am writing is because I think the governor needs to add more jobs to the employment commision because they are busy now with all these lay offs. It isnt fair for us that have always worked and now struggle not only with our finances, but we struggle just to get the aid we deserve. We have paid taxes our whole life only to suffer now. I know my letter willl do no good, it probably wont even get read, but at least it is giving me a chance to voice my opinion. Thank you.

Michael F. Easley
Governor of North Carolina

Dear Governor Easley:

I have always admired your opinion on the American family and the importance of freedom.

It is “Freedom” that I am requesting your assistance with in the matter of my husband, Danny Paul Dayberry (OPUS # 010400). He is currently an inmate at Gaston Correctional Center in Dallas, North Carolina. Danny is nearing the end of his 12 year 7 month sentence for a fatal automobile accident he was involved in and charged with vehicular murder. His release date is April 28, 2009. To many this may not seen to be of any significant amount of time, but to us we count every day as a blessing and being able to be share it with each other would be the best gift imaginable. I believe the importance of having a family and the simple things of life is becoming a vanishing part of American life.

Danny has been a model inmate with no infractions since 2/1999 which has made him able to achieve his level 3 honor grade, have CV passes, able to work off of the prison site with DOT workers while at Cleveland Correctional Center, and at the present time is working off prison site with the town of Bessemer City, be eligible for work release where he would be paid a working man’s wage ,but due to the economy and the lack of jobs available has not been able to find a job, and has been granted home passes since 9/2008. Danny is a hard worker and dreams of coming home to his family.

We are praying that you will grant his early pardon from prison. Thank you for your time. God bless you.

Sincerely,

Alicia C. Dayberry, RN, BSN

It's kind of hard to determine the issue, but I think it's that he's not happy with the customer service of his local DMV.

How is it that my wife and daughter who are permanent residence of the United States cannot get their driver’s license renewed because they are holding a conditional card. USCIS makes no distinctions between a permanent residence card and a conditional permanent residence card. They were also treated like crap at the DMV office.

Hi - we have a list that I can email you, but before you print it, please know that it is over 500 pages long.  It covers all the recipients, not just those from Holshouser's years in office.  You'd have to sort through and figure out which ones they were based on date, and that's not going to be easy since the list is in alphabetical order.  Let me know if you still want it, and we will send it to you.

If you are looking for a particular individual, we can search the list for you.

Dear Ms. Reaves:

Your recent e-mail to Governor Easley has been received.  We are responding
on his behalf.  We are sorry for your loss of Blue.

The Governor does not have any authority over local police departments.
Concerns about the way the Durham Police have handled an issue should be
shared with the district attorney or your representatives on the Durham City
Counsel.  Additionally, by law Wachovia is prohibited from releasing tapes
unless they have been given the authority by court order (subpoena) to do
so.

We are sorry that we cannot be of assistance to you.

Office of the Governor

Governor Perdue,

Congratulations on your election!  I am an Independent; however, for the first time in my life, I voted a straight ticket - Democratic.

I am concerned about your recent statement about redecorating the Governor's office.  In a time when our state is in grave financial straights, I strongly urge you not to spend money on such a frivilous pursuit.  Even if donors provide the money, that gives the impression that you will owe that industry or people favors in the future - not exactly the ethical message I'm sure you want to convey.

Another reason this is not a good idea is that it will be perceived as a "FEMALE" thing.  As a female who held high-level positions within the federal government until my recent retirement, I am dismayed that, in this day, a female executive should even comment about the appearance of her office.  I have worked in whatever office the man who held the job before me did. 

My advice to you is "suck it up, girlfriend" and put those funds where they are truly needed in our beloved North Carolina.

Good luck.

A native-born Tar Heel who is proud and glad to be back home, 

(Ms) Dale Smith

Pinehurst, NC

Subject: the state deficit

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: First, congratulations on getting elected. Our state is facing a long list of problems, most notably, the budget shortfall. Q: what plans do you have to reduce this without placing extra burdens on taxpayers? Q: have you considered the possibility of legalizing, regulating and taxing the number one cash crop in our state (country)? Yes, I am referring to marijuana. The underground economy, based upon marijuana, is booming - yet generates ZERO tax revenue for our state. Why not legalize, regulate and most importantly TAX it? Where could it be sold? Simple, in our ABC stores. If adults are able to ingest alcohol (a substance which if consumed in too great a quantity will result in death), then adults should be able to consume marijuana (there have been no reported cases of fatalities from using cannabis). The state of Massachusetts recently decriminalized possession of small amounts of cannabis, however this will only serve to fuel the underground economy even more. While Massachusetts will now undoubtedly spend less taxpayer money from year to year due to less marijuana related arrests - what they have done is only try to solve "half the problem". The "other half" is to capture the economic benefit via taxation of a legal product. Dealers don't mind decriminalization, it will mean more business for them - but they truly fear legalization / sale via ABC stores, etc. Why? because they would LOSE all of their customers. Net: please seriously consider the legalization, regulation and taxation of marijuana. The demand will never go away, but as Governor, you could utilize the supply to the state's economic advantage. Treating it in a manner similar to alcohol would send a message to the children that it is a substance only meant for adults. Thank you for taking the time to read this. For your information, I currently do not use cannabis. I am writing this to you in the hopes that government can finally think outside the box in an attempt to solve our state's problems. Sincerely, James T. Halka 704-488-0910

Subject: Early Childhood Education

Comment: First I would like to say CONGRATS! I voted for you and I am so pleased and overwhelmed by this history making moment for our great stae of NC! I am an early childhood professional and I have sent in a comment before on the issue. I am glad that you are a supporter of early childhood education and I just wanted to know if you will continue the Child Care Wages project? It has been a blessing to me and those of us who care for tomorrow's leaders. I would like to see the program continue. As you may already know the salary for those of us who lay the foundation for all educational experiences (Child Care to College) make very little compared to other professions. My husband is a truck driver, he doesn't have a college degree, however he makes more money than I do and I do have a college degree.It is my hope that you will personally respond to my email although if you do not I understand, but I would at the very least like an answer to my question. Again, CONGRATS!

Subject: Priorities as NC's Governor

Comment: I have serious concerns regarding an article in the News and Observer about your plans to redecorate the Governor's Mansion at this point in time. I'm a woman so it's not that I don't understand about decor. I'm all for you going all out to redecorate, if you're using your money. On the other hand, if it involves using taxpayers' money, then I can't believe you could even consider with a clear conscience making changes just because the decor doesn't suit your taste. There are so many hard-working Americans that are barely getting by, now not knowing if they'll even have a job the next day. The government has cut spending on our children's educations - our country's future leaders, and also cutting spending on our elderly population - What kind of message is that sending? I guess my point in all of this is please reconsider what is really important - you are living in a mansion, you're the governor - you can either set an example for other politicians and the people of North Carolina to see. It's a choice - will you choose to stand out and make a difference, or fall in with the crowd and play the "game" of politics? This isn't a letter written in anger, but in concern for our state and for our country's future. Every little bit can make a difference. Thank you for your time and consideration. Anissa White

Subject: Children's Rights

Comment: Dear Governor, What is North Carolina's position on protecting children's rights in custody proceedings? In other words, if a North Carolina child runs the risk of being deported as a result of a questionable judicial decision, is there an existing law that protects that child from a decision that could wreck that child's future? How can I, as a citizen, help protect a child's rights without having to spend a fortune in legal fees? Shouldn't each child have a right to a legal guardian when inalienable rights are in jeopardy of being violated? Our granddaughter suffered such a fate with no one in court to defend her rights against a questionable decision by Guilford County District Court. Our family thought highly of the US judicial system until experience showed us that injustice has become a globalized affair, even in Greensboro. The UCCJEA which Judges Enochs and Turner used to justify the deportation of our granddaughter is an act with an unfair edge favoring foreign litigants to the detriment of American respondents. The act could have been applied differently in the child's interest and favor, but it wasn't. This act made it possible for a biological deadbeat Frenchman dad to unjustly deprive a child of her mother, the happy four years of life lived in Greensboro with extended family and friends, and condemned her to an all French language school in Milan, Italy with no English speaking classmates or friends and a Spanish speaking great-aunt as her caretaker replacing her loving and caring and working single mom. This is how Guilford County District Court administered justice on September 26, 2008 with Judge Turner's oral enforcement of an Italian decree. A decision Stayed by the Appeals Court in Raleigh but too late to save our granddaughter from her dire destiny as she was spirited away from US jurisdiction in subterfuge abroad to Paris, France. Our granddaughter, who is a naturalized American is a case of justice gone wrong because international laws for the protection of children were ignored by a North Carolina court. Our aim as grandparents is to seek justice in our granddaughter's interest and that of all defenseless children victims of judicial carelessness. For the records, the grandmother is American raised and schooled in New York and Massachusetts while the grandfather is Italian. The Judicial Standards Commission has been contacted regarding the above, but we feel that as First Grandmother, the subject matter would be of concern to your office as the new Governor. Sincerely, Lydia and Adriano Manca Grandparents Ph: 336 617 8798

Subject: Save NC money and embarrassment

Comment: hundreds of thousands of dollars are being wasted in Department of Commerce. with the possibility of over $1 million by the end of this year. Some of these cost includes criminal actions taken against employees making complaints. Some of the criminal actions involve members of the Attorney General's office. Some employees may release evidence of bribes paid over the past 8 years for large incentives. The documents are hidden in state government servers. Here is a sample, businesses are required to make a "contribution" that is split in percentages. The Assisant Secretary of Administration works the financial magic through contracts and with the help of the CFO while the CIO and Deputy CIO covers the tracks (along with contractors and "trusted" employees) of electronic communications. Anyone putting the pieces together is then setup and fired. Then AG staff takes care of making sure the employee is no longer credible. Check all the former employees over the past 8 years who had "inappropriate" materials (porn etc.) on their computer etc. Then have Michael King give up other peoples' backup emails documents he has been keeping to protect himself (against Denise Sessoms orders). Last known to be in his bottom desk drawer on CD-Roms and DVD. I will make myself public if I lose my job or they are arrested.

Subject: FAIRNESS IN GOVERNMENT

Comment: 2009-01-11 Gov Purdue, May I get some help with this unfair decision? Thanks, John Radford, LSC //////////////////////////////////////////// STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS COUNTY OF JOHNSTON 06 EDC 1841 JOHN M. RADFORD, JR., Petitioner, v.NORTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, Respondent, )))))))) DECISION THIS MATTER came on for hearing before the undersigned, Joe L. Webster, Administrative Law Judge, on April 19, 2007, in Raleigh, North Carolina. APPEARANCES For Petitioner: Bradley N. Schulz Mast, Schulz, Mast, Johnson & Wells, P.A. Post Office Box 119 Smithfield, North Carolina 27577 For Respondent: Laura E. Crumpler Assistant Attorney General North Carolina Department of Justice P.O. Box 629 Raleigh, North Carolina 27602 ISSUE Whether the Respondent wrongfully denied Petitionerâ€™s request for salary credit for â€œnon-teachingâ€ experience based upon his prior experience as a Revenue Officer I with the North Carolina Department of Revenue. APPLICABLE STATUTES AND RULES Official notice is taken of the following statutes and rules applicable to this case: N.C. Gen Stat. Â§ 150B-23 N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 115C-296 State Board of Education Policy QP-A-006 WITNESS FOR PETITIONER John M. Radford Robbie B. McLamb Lisa Beth Corser WITNESSES FOR RESPONDENT Sheila White Charles David Bennett Ellen Greaves EXHIBITS RECEIVED INTO EVIDENCE Petitioner Exhibits 1-7 were received into evidence. Respondent Exhibits 1-12 were received into evidence. BASED UPON careful consideration of the sworn testimony presented at the hearing and the entire record in this proceeding, the undersigned makes the following: FINDINGS OF FACT 1. Respondent, North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (â€œDPIâ€), is charged with the responsibility of licensing professional educators in North Carolina. 2. Teachers in North Carolina are paid on a salary schedule based upon experience level, meaning that a teacher receives a salary increase as his/her experience level increases. The salary schedule incremental increases are based upon both degree level and experience level. 3. Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 115C-295, all teachers employed in the public schools of North Carolina must be certified, or licensed, to teach. North Carolina General Statute Â§115C-296(a) provides, in pertinent part, as follows: The State Board of Education shall have entire control of certifying all applicants for teaching positions in all public elementary and high schools of North Carolina; and it shall prescribe the rules and regulations for the renewal and extension of all certificates and shall determine and fix the salary for each grade and type of certificate which it authorizes. . . . N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 115C-296(a). 4. Pursuant to its statutory authority to â€œdetermine and fix the salary for each grade and type of certificate which it authorizes,â€ the State Board of Education (hereinafter the â€œSBEâ€) has adopted a policy, QP-A-006, entitled â€œPolicies related to Experience/Degree Credit for Salary Purposes.â€ 5. The policy recognizes that educators employed in the public schools may be awarded salary credit for past employment experience as well as for certain graduate degrees. Generally, the salary credit falls into three main categories: (1) prior experience as a teacher; (2) prior work experience that is non-teaching in nature; and (3) possession of a graduate degree. 6. Respondent employs licensure specialists to evaluate license applications and also to evaluate requests for non-teaching work experience for salary schedule purposes. 7. Licensure specialists are given a three-page policy guide and a general information guide, both of which list North Carolina State Board of Educationâ€™s policy on granting experience/degree credit for salary purposes. The documents state how salaries are calculated and who is eligible for the experience/degree credit. 8. In order to be eligible to receive credit for prior â€œnon-teachingâ€ work experience, the prior work experience must meet several criteria. The critical factor for deciding whether to award â€œnon-teachingâ€ work experience credit, however, is whether that prior work experience is â€œdirectly relatedâ€ to an individualâ€™s area of licensure and work assignment. 9. Specifically, QP-A-006 provides, in pertinent part, as follows: Non-teaching work experience shall be defined as professional work experience in public or private sectors that is directly related to an individualâ€™s area of licensure and work assignment. State Board of Education Policy QP-A-006, section 6.20 (emphasis added). 10. Petitioner is currently employed by the Wayne County Public Schools as a Guidance Counselor under a provisional license, and only has four more courses to complete. 11. After beginning employment as a Guidance Counselor in 2005, Petitioner requested credit for past non-teaching work experience. The Local Education Authority recommended that Petitioner receive credit for 16 years. 12. Petitionerâ€™s request for credit was initially denied by members of licensure staff at the Department of Public Instruction. The denial was based upon the Departmentâ€™s determination that the prior experience was not â€œdirectly relatedâ€ to Petitionerâ€™s area of licensure and teaching assignment. 13. Following this initial denial, and pursuant to SBE Policy QP-A-006, Petitionerâ€™s employer, Wayne County Schools, requested a review by the Experience Credit Appeals Panel. 14. The school system and Petitioner submitted further documentation in support of his request for non-teaching experience credit, including official job descriptions from his Revenue Officer I position, official job description of a school guidance counselor, and Petitionerâ€™s own comparison of his previous job duties with the job duties of school guidance counselor. 15. According to the official job description of the Revenue Officer I, the person in that position: is responsible for resolving complex, high liability delinquent tax cases. The Revenue Officer I must possess comprehensive knowledge of all tax schedules in order to determine tax liability, secure delinquent tax returns, conduct tax investigations, and assist taxpayers with filing delinquent returns. The Revenue Officer I position plays a key role in the Departmentâ€™s enforcement efforts to enhance taxpayer compliance by educating the public and collecting the Stateâ€™s General Fund Revenues. 16. The job description divides the duties of the Revenue Officer I into two categories: (1) Research and Enforcement; and (2) Administration of the North Carolina Revenue Laws. 17. Research and Enforcement comprises about 90% of the duties and includes various investigative duties. Petitioner admitted on the stand that, consistent with the job description, he frequently dealt with the Department of Motor Vehicles, with lawyers and clerks of the court, with banks and bank records, and with the Employment Security Commission. Petitioner had to review court tax records and the grantor-grantee indexes in the courthouse. He stated he had to have a working knowledge of accounting concepts, business law and tax schedules. 18. In fact, Petitionerâ€™s prior experience was deemed to be creditable towards his other license area of â€œbusiness educationâ€ and â€œmiddle grades business.â€ The Licensure Section determined that Petitionerâ€™s work as a Revenue Officer I was â€œdirectly relatedâ€ to the area of business education, and awarded him the full 16 yearsâ€™ experience credit. However, his prior experience as a Revenue Officer I, while related to business, was not related to guidance counseling and was not transferable under the State Board Policy. (â€œCredit for non-teaching work experience is not transferable to other licensure areas for which the experience is not relevant.â€ SBE Policy QP-A-006, section 6.20). 19. The purpose of the school guidance counselor, as set forth in the job description, is to â€œpromote student success, provide preventative services, and respond to identified student needs by implementing a comprehensive school counseling program that addresses academic career, and personal/social development for all students.â€ 20. The school guidance counselor is responsible for interpreting student test data; assisting students in developing academic and career goals; working with parents, the community and students concerning identified concerns and needs; providing individual and group counseling; interacting and communicating with teachers, administrators, and other school personnel; adhering to relevant laws, policies, and procedures; monitoring student academic performance, behavior and attendance; and assists with appropriate intervention. 21. All of the information submitted by Petitioner in support of his request was presented to the Appeals Panel at its September 26, 2006, meeting. The Panel reviewed the material and compared the official job responsibilities of the prior work experience with the Standard Course of Study and job expectations of the position of school guidance counselor. 22. The Panel consists of professional educators, none of whom is employed by the State Board of Education or the Department of Public Instruction. The Panel was created to give another level of review in the process and specifically to permit teachers another opportunity to present information in an objective forum. The Panel is inclined to give the benefit of a doubt to teachers but nevertheless seek to award credit only within the strict letter of the State Boardâ€™s policy and to ensure consistency in the process statewide. 23. The Panel here thoroughly reviewed and considered the information submitted, and after deliberating, voted unanimously to deny Petitionerâ€™s request. 24. Two members of the Panel testified at the hearing of this matter. Both stated that, in their opinion, the job duties of the Revenue Officer I were not sufficiently related to the job duties of school guidance counselor to award salary credit. The role of a school guidance counselor involves assessing student test data, dealing with the studentâ€™s future plans, working with parents, and assisting students with interpersonal skills. 25. While Petitioner described some job duties that involved working with taxpayers on a personal level, as Respondentâ€™s witnesses pointed out, most employees, especially those in professional capacities, engage in some counseling. 26. Petitioner admitted on the stand that he did not deal with adolescents, did not deal with class schedules, did not deal with testing or scholarships, did not deal with teachers or principals, and was not familiar with school laws. 27. The term â€œdirectly relatedâ€ as used in the State Board Policy at issue here, and as applied by DPI staff and the Panel members, is a term of art that is understood by the licensure staff, by members of the Panel, and by personnel administrators in the local school systems. 28. Licensure staff is trained on the job for six to nine months prior to being permitted to apply the policy without oversight by supervisors. The Panel members worked closely with the policy in earlier attempts to revise portions of it and have had substantial experience in applying it to real situations. The term â€œdirectly related,â€ sometimes used interchangeably with â€œdirectly relevant,â€ describes the process of comparing â€œwhat the person was doing in a verifiable way in their [sic] past . . . with the specific responsibilities and knowledge and skills that would be required to fulfill the position in public education.â€ 29. As stated by Dr. Ellen Greaves, a licensed attorney and educator and member of the Panel, there is no precise formula for determining whether the prior experience is â€œdirectly relatedâ€ to oneâ€™s area of licensure and teaching assignment. It is a â€œsituationally contextual understanding.â€ In this case, the direct relationship did not exist and the Panel voted unanimously to deny the credit. BASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact, the undersigned makes the following: CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 1. The parties are properly before the Office of Administrative Hearings. 2. Petitioner bears the burden of proving the claims alleged in the Petition by a preponderance of evidence. Peace v. Employment Sec. Commâ€™n., 349 N.C. 315, 507 S.E.2d 272 (1998). 3. The State Board of Education has the constitutional power â€œto supervise and administer the free public school system and the educational funds provided for its support.â€ N.C. Const. art IX, Â§ 5. This power includes the power to â€œregulate the grade [and] salary . . . of teachers.â€ Guthrie v. Taylor, 279 N.C. 703, 709, 185 S.E.2d 193, 198 (1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 920, 32 L.Ed.2d 119 (1972). The State Board has the specific duty â€œto certify and regulate the grade and salary of teachers and other school employees.â€ N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 115C-12(9)a; Guthrie at 711. 4. Finally, the State Board has the statutory authority to â€œdetermine and fix the salary for each grade and type of certificate which it authorizes . . . .â€ N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 115C-296(a). 5. While Petitionerâ€™s duties as a Revenue Officer I were directly related to or relevant to his former position as a business teacher, his duties as a Revenue I Officer were not directly related to or relevant to his new duties as a school Guidance Counselor. 6. In reaching this determination the court relies upon the testimony of individuals with years of experience in applying the policy and the uninterrupted interpretation of that policy over the years. This court may rely upon consistent interpretation by a State Agency of its own statutes and policies in reaching a conclusion with regard to the application of a particular policy to a given set of facts. See State v. Jones, 358 N.C. 473, 598 S.E.2d 125 (2004); Frye Regional Medical Center, Inc. v. Hunt, 350 N.C. 39, 510 S.E.2d 159 (1999). Moreover, the agencyâ€™s interpretation of its own policies is controlling unless it is plainly erroneous. Morrell v. Flaherty, 338 NC 230, 237, 449 S.E.2d 175, 179-80 (1994). 7. Petitioner has not met his burden of demonstrating that Respondent has deprived him of property or has otherwise substantially prejudiced his rights and that Respondent has: (1) Exceeded its authority; (2) Acted erroneously; (3) Failed to use proper procedure; (4) Acted arbitrarily or capriciously; or (5) Failed to act as required by law or rule. DECISION The undersigned recommends that the State Board of Education affirm the decision of the Department to deny the Petitioner the relief requested. ORDER AND NOTICE The Agency that will make the final decision in this contested case is the North Carolina State Board of Education. The Agency is required to give each party an opportunity to file exceptions to the recommended decision and to present written arguments to those in the Agency who will make the final decision. N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 150-36(a). The Agency is required by N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 150B-36(b) to serve a copy of the final decision on all parties and to furnish a copy to the partiesâ€™ attorney of record and to the Office of Administrative Hearings. In accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 150B-36 the Agency shall adopt each finding of fact contained in the Administrative Law Judgeâ€™s decision unless the finding is clearly contrary to the preponderance of the admissible evidence. For each finding of fact not adopted by the agency, the agency shall set forth separately and in detail the reasons for not adopting the finding of fact and the evidence in the record relied upon by the agency in not adopting the finding of fact. For each new finding of fact made by the agency that is not contained in the Administrative Law Judgeâ€™s decision, the agency shall set forth separately and in detail the evidence in the record relied upon by the agency in making the finding of fact.

Hey Bev,



Congratulations on your victory and your first day in office!

I know you are getting a number of calls and emails so I want to thank you in advance for reading this but I have no expectation for you to reply. J



I don’t know who to write to about this so you came to mind J.



I was wondering how we could get back the old “write off the interest on car loans?”

I was about 12yrs old at the time the government took it back.



The US Gov’t could reinstate this old tax law but make solely for American made cars.



This would boost the sales of GM, Chrysler, and Ford as well as give a financial incentive for the public to purchase.



I hope this helps,

I appreciate your public service Bev,

Thank you,



Chris

Subject: Stars and Stripes U.S. Young Adult Council

Comment: Dear Mrs. Governor, Good day. Our names are Kathryn and Katie. We are writing to you as concerned and determined United States citizens. We are aware that everyone is equal under God and the law, as stated by the United States Declaration of Independence, but we both strongly believe that young adults (people between the ages of 10 and 17) do not participate in political affairs as much as is desirable. We understand that children/young adults are recognized and limited fairly by the laws. It is also understandable that many United States children do not recognize political concepts, as well as other concepts, as well as adults. However, we feel that we understand a lot. We know that we are capable of learning more, just as other politically interested young adults are. We both have dreams/goals of becoming very politically involved in the US government of this blessed country. We are ready to strive for accomplishment of these goals at a young age, for we hold the future in our hands. We would appreciate it if you would help us to make the very best of this opportunity, for young adults, for our country, and for helping the world become a better place! We are proposing the following idea to you in hopes that you, as our stateâ€™s governor, will consider it and perhaps allow us to begin making a difference in this country, as young adults, the holders of the future! In each state of this country, we dream that there could be a cluster of ten to twenty (depending on the stateâ€™s population) privileged young adults who could meet possibly in the Governorâ€™s Mansion once a monthâ€”or somewhere else, if needed or preferred. This council would be called the Stars & Stripes U.S. Young Adult Council. Each state meeting would be a gathering of young adults representing their state, who would talk about ways to make the country and their state a safer, happier, and generally better place to live. Young adults would be accepted into Stars & Stripes by writing a detailed persuasive essay explaining why they would like to be involved in their stateâ€™s council. The founders and/or the governor would decide which essays were most convincing and well written, and then the top essay contestants would be accepted into the council. Each young adult would create a project displaying one particular problem of the state or country and ways to help solve the problem. If the idea is recognized, the project and the creator will have the opportunity to travel to Washington, D.C. to present their project in the Lincoln Memorial to the other state representatives from the Stars & Stripes US Young Adult Council. No more than five representatives should be sent from each state. We are aware that this idea would take a lot of effort on both your and our parts, but we are willing to undertake this challenge since it will benefit our country, and we hope that you are too. We are not writing to you as mere little children, but as determined, confident, and strong-willed young adults who are going to help this country, and, farther, this world in making a better place to live. We would deeply appreciate it if you would lend us some of your time so we can all work on our Stars & Stripes US Young Adult Council as a team and as a country. In closing, we hope that you will consider our proposal/request seriously, and will not under-take this thinking that we will not follow through all the way to the end, because we will. We are doing this for our country, not for our pleasure or your inconvenience, but to make changing the world more enjoyable! Have a nice day, and thank you for your time. Please reply as soon as possible to give us your feedback! Best regards, Kathryn A. Buckner Katherine (Katie) E. Shy (Hopefully) Founders of the Stars & Stripes US Young Adult Council

Subject: Car accident involving State Trooper

Comment: I am writing this to your office, due to the fact that I am getting nowhere fast with the insurance company or the attorney general office. On Dec 22,2008, State Trooper Spring lost control of his patrol car and ran off the road in Verona on High Hill road. When he ran off the road he caused damage to my driveway, my 1995 Ford Thunderbird, and a tree in my yard. It is going on 4 weeks now and nothing has been done about paying me for the damage to my property. If I had been the one at fault, then I would have been required to pay for the damage by now, I feel that I am being jerked around and nothing will be done about this. I am currntly on active duty and stationed at Fort Bragg, I guess serving my country and state means nothing when something like this happens, like they say, out of sight, out of mind. Thank you for your time.

Subject: Pit Bull Dogs

Comment: I am writing you because my husband and I are looking for a place to rent to own for our family. Our family includes a little boy that is about to be 1 year old, and 3 pit bulls. How ever we cannot rent or rent to own. The only thing that we can do it buy a home with all the money that it cost without doing a mortgage and we cant afford to do that. Right now we are living at my father-in-laws home my husband dad, and there is no room for all of us to live there. I do not think that it is fair to be penalized for having 3 well behaved, loving pit bulls that get along with everyone and there is no way that they would be around my son or nephew if they were mean. I think that pit bulls shouldn't be discriminated against.

Subject: Bullet Ownership Bill

Comment: Honorable Elected Representative, It has come to my attention that you may be considering the â€œBullet Ownership Bill,â€ which would require anyone who wishes to purchase ammunition to first acquire a permit. The intent of this legislation is for the Greater Good. This noble effort actually subverts the Greater Good by becoming but one more law added to the literally thousands of firearms laws nation wide. Clearly, another one will not positively effect the Greater Good. Restrictions on ammunition are popular these days as a stop gap measure and feel as though they are effective. They are fostered by some as an opportunity to get around the Supreme Court's Heller decision, affirming that the Second Amendment guarantees our individual Right to Keep and Bear Arms. Just as law-abiding citizens have the right to own firearms, by default WE have the right to own the ammunition for those arms. In the wake of the Heller decision, states should be looking at ways to strengthen the rights protected under the Second Amendment, not weaken them, as the â€œBullet Ownership Billâ€ proposal would do. The Greater Good would be much better served if the existing laws were enforced. The Greater Good would be much better served if criminals were punished, not law-abiding citizens. Could you please explain your position on this matter to me ? Respectfully, Tina Rutherford

Subject: milage tax

Comment: I was just wondering about the proposed tax on milage of our cars. Being retired we travel to visit with each of our children in different states every year. Since we are on social security it would be a hardship for us. I also don't like the idea of a GPS in our car and taking away our privacy leaving us open to whoever and whatever. Maybe you could explain something I am missing in this proposal. Thankyou

Subject: Tax Relief

Comment: North Carolina has been my home since I was born, but my family and I are ready to move because of the high taxes we pay here at home. Income, Sales, Property, Fuel, phone, water, power, and the list keeps on growing!!! Lets try something new forgo taxes and let our state live. We can not afford to support this states spending any longer!! You or ones before you have wasted so much money doing nothing, are you going to be different, I think not. I think that you and all of goverment think that you are smart enough to spend your way out of trouble. Lets try not spending and giving back to the people who are doing the work. The bale out bill from the Federal Goverment of $750,000,000,000.00 would be over 2.4 million per every person in the United States. Hey give that to Americans and forget thoses company's who wasted theirs. Are you the same as the stupid people in the federal level. I think so but I hope not!! How are you going to CUT spending!!

Subject: Education

Comment: I have a question relating to the Education Report. It is identified in the Areas to address that comprehensive mental health, health, etc should be provided through schools but I see no implementation recommendation for it. Is there one? Do you intend to address this issue? IF so, how? This is a very important area and yet one that everyone seems to gloss over and fail to really understand when it comes to implementation. Mental Health reform has meant that these services do not exist except for all students. Services are only for those who are able to be diagnosed with a disorder of some magnitude and even some services for those with diagnoses are to be provided in the most natural environment,i.e. the school environment when it comes to children. This is not a bad concept, however, the school does not have the resources necessary to implement this concept. NO one has discussed this as a part of the Mental Health reform issues. Second, it has been thought that school social work can be provided by DSS, however it cannot as they only can provide mandated services. Schools have many children served and needing services who are not eligible for mandated services. Who do you think refers children in large number to make them eligible for those mandated services? SCHOOL Social Workers!! I could go on with other areas, but I think you get the picture. I do want to address one final area and that is teacher retention. People do not seem to understand all that goes into "I don't get paid enough to do this job" In talking with teachers I have learned that this includes the fact that over the years of focusing on the classroom only, they have lost all their support and now have become responsible for being expert in all disciplines and doing jobs for which they have no expertise. Instructional support personnel no longer exist in a way that they can support the teacher in her/his job of educating children who come from very difficult circumstances, whether that be living in abusive situations and come to school tired, hungry, in need of protection, etc. or with severe disabilities that must be identified and specific plans drawn up to assist with their educational success. It is not all about money. It is my hope that your administration will address these issues as they have been ignored for several years. Children fall through the cracks because of this.

Comment: I was recently offered a position with state government and shortly after the offer, I was told that due to a 3% budget cut, I could be laid-off prior to starting a new job. This department is waiting to see what the new administration's policies will be toward department budgets. Will Governor Perdue continue state department budget cuts?

Thank you for your response.  May I make a sugggestion regarding your "Constituent Services" link on the web page?

Once the submit button has been pressed the next page has only a "data submitted" message with the submit button still in clear view.  I found it confusing and ended up pressing submit again, thereby sending your office the same message twice.  Instead of "data submitted"  how about a clearer confirmation message that lets the user know for sure their message has been sent?

Other than that, nice website!
