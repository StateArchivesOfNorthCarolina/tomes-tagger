I have e-mailed two other letters, but have composed a letter with more information and it follows. Thank you taking the time to read this and I appreciate anything you can do to help me and my son.

I am asking for help to correct a very wrong situation that has occurred and I am hoping that you could help me and my son. Please let me introduce myself. My name is Katherine Flynn. My son is Andrew Scott Kislek. The state of North Carolina has incorrectly issued a warrant for his arrest in North Carolina. I am not sure of the exact charge; my son says it was a felony charge to do with trafficking a license. Please let me explain what has happened. My son is innocent of these charges and we need someone in a position of authority to help us get the charges dropped!

I lived in North Carolina for 5 years. During this time I was married to Timothy Wesley Conway. Mr. Conway is now my ex-husband. When we were first married Mr. Conway was an employee of the North Carolina DMV. One day he brought home a motorcycle learner’s permit that had belonged to Terry LaBonte the race car driver. He had given Mr. LaBonte his regular motorcycle license and kept the learner’s permit. He put the license away and I thought no more about it. Mr. Conway was fired from the DMV in North Carolina while we were together. I am not sure of the reason, but I think it had to do with him speaking badly about superiors to customers. We then moved to Tucson, Arizona. We separated and after about 9 months Mr. Conway gave me back some of my possessions which included a chest of drawers where I found the Terry LaBonte license. The license stayed in the drawer a long time. A gentleman at work was talking about NASCAR one day and I mentioned the license. He sa id perhaps a collector of sports memorabilia might like to have it. I was working full-time as a secretary at the University of Arizona and supporting my son and myself as he worked hard to get through college. I thought about what my friend said about a collector wanting the license as it would be similar to having an autographed item that Mr. LaBonte had signed. I looked online and saw that Babe Ruth’s family had sold his driver’s license. There was another sports star that it mentioned had done similar but I cannot recall the name at the time. I also looked online to make sure that Mr. LaBontes’ address was not the same; it appeared that he had moved to Winston-Salem. I did not want someone to have his actual physical address. There was NO social security number on the license. The license was long since expired. With all of the aforementioned information, I decided to post an ad on E-Bay. I composed the ad, which stated clearly that it was a one of kind piece of memorabilia. I was in no way trying to steal anyone’s identity! I scanned the photo of the license. The problem was that I had no E-Bay account, nor the knowledge of how to use it. My son, Andrew Kislek, happened to have an account as he had used E-Bay to sell his collection of “Magic the Gathering” cards and had purchased items on E-Bay. He stood by and showed me how to post the ad. I put the actual ad on E-Bay. I only asked him to check the e-mail as it was his account. There was some contact regarding the ad, but NO SALE.

The ad was only online a couple of weeks as best I can recall. The state of North Carolina contacted my son. He told them the situation; that we got the license in a piece of furniture that my ex-husband gave back to me. The investigator asked to have the license returned. I returned the license by mailing it to the address he gave to my son. Let me reiterate that my son never had any kind of possession of this license. I scanned the license for the ad and e-mailed him the copy so he could show me how to put it on the ad. I wrote the ad for E-Bay and, again, he showed me how to put it on there. My son’s only involvement was to allow me to use his account. This was explained to the investigator. I called the number my son gave me and left him a message stating the fact that I was responsible for the ad, the content and placing that ad. We have not heard from the investigator for a very long time. My son found out quite by accident that there was a warrant for his arr est in North Carolina. This is a grave mistake on the part of the state of North Carolina. He is innocent of these charges. If they should charge anyone, it should be me!!!! Could you please contact the DMV and the investigator tohelp get these charges dropped against my son. This will save the state a lot of money in prosecuting an innocent person!! We need help as I cannot afford an attorney. It seems fruitless and just plain wrong to bring charges against someone who is innocent and the person who should be charged has told the investigator that they are responsible. The investigator, I believe, is Dail Eason. He can be reached at 1-910-486-1331. You will need to ask for him personally. I have tried to contact him but was told he was out of the office until Monday. I am sure the state of North Carolina would not want to be responsible for charging an innocent person and I would hope Mr. Eason would be kind enough to drop the charges against my son immediately. I am re sponsible for what has happened and have reiterated that fact. Please help me. I am a respectable person that has had no problems with the law. However, I cannot afford an attorney to fight the charges for my son. It hurts me deeply that I don’t have the money to do that! My salary is just about $20,000 a year after all deductions. I have managed to live on that and help my son through college. I have always tried to do the right thing and I am hoping this situation can be corrected immediately.

I can be reached at my home address; it is 8851 E 27th Street, Tucson, AZ 85710 My cell phone number is 520-307-2722. My work number at the University of Arizona is 520-626-6702. Please try my cell phone number until January 5th as the University is closed during this time. I have been employed at the University for 5 ½ years. Before that I was employed at Davidson County Mental in Thomasville, North Carolina for 4 ½ years. I enjoyed my time in North Carolina and I know there are good people there that will help me get this issue corrected.Thank you in advance for anything you can do to assist me in this matter.

Sincerely,

Katherine Flynn

Importance: High



Dear North Carolina Elected Officials:

My name is Susan Gilroy.  I live in Mount Holly, NC in Gaston county.  I am certain that I am not the first parent to write to you this week regarding the experience many children had with the Junior Presidential Youth Inaugural Conference, run by the Congressional Youth Leadership Council (Envision EMI).   Many of you are listed as Senators and Congressmen on the Honorary Board.  I'm hopefull that you are investigating this company and considering having your name disassociated from it. 

I am attaching below two letters that I wrote to Barbara Harris that outline my son, Tyler's, experience at the Inaugural Conference this past week.  I also encourage you to visit <http://jrpyicparentcomplaints.webs.com/apps/blog>http://jrpyicparentcomplaints.webs.com/apps/blog to read the accounts of the 300 plus parents whose children returned sick, frightened, and disappointed to say the least.  My son faired well compared to children who were left to wander the National Mall on Inauguration Day amid the million plus people in atttendance, as well as those who were left at the airport to find their flights on their own, only to miss them and wonder what to do next.  Parents were kept in the dark, lied to, and waited unreasonable amounts of time for responces from the conference organizers when they called the 800 number we were all given in case of problems. 

I know this is already a long letter and I appreciate your time in reading it and looking into the situation.  Indeed, over 15,000 families were scammed by this organization.  Most paid almost between $2500 and $4000 for tuition, travel, clothing, etc. to send our children to this historic event.  A good many of the events were not delivered as promised and many children were put in danger while there.  Envision EMI is "investigating" our claims, has hired an attorney to look into the situation, and has set aside $1 Million for which they have not made clear on how it will be used.  They took in over $40 million from all the families attending. More needs to be done.

Again, thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Susan Gilroy

This is the first letter I wrote.  I really just needed to vent.  I did not send this one.



Dear Ms. Harris,



I have waited several days to write regarding my son, Tyler's, experience at the JrPYIC, mostly to give him time to be able to talk about it, as well as to collect myself and seperate my emotions about the situation.  Tyler attended the JrNYLC Conference in DC the summer of 2007 and the Alumni Conference in Boston this past summer.  Both times we felt the experience Tyler received met the hefty price tag.  We felt that he got every experience and educational opportunity he was promised on both trips.  Because of those experiences, we did not hesitate to send Tyler to the Inaugural Conference.  We have been gushing for months to anyone who would listen about the tremendous opportunities our son would be afforded on this trip.  Family members, community members, teachers, our co-workers have been updated everytime we learned of a new speaker, or opportunity that Tyler would experience.  He left school last Thursday with teachers and classmates beaming and anxious to hear what he would witness on such an historic trip.  As I drove my son from North Carolina to Maryland, we had plenty of time to talk about what he was excited about and how he felt about being one of a million people to set foot on the National Mall on Tuesday and be a witness to history.  Tyler ate, slept, and breathed this election, knowing that whatever the result, he would be there to see the next President of the United States take the oath of office before his very eyes.

We spent Friday night in PA at my mother's house before heading to MD on Saturday morning.  Of course, she was thrilled for her Grandson and told him how all she's been doing is bragging to her friends about his being at the inauguration.  On the way to his housing site, we stopped by his other grandparents house so they could wish him well on his trip.  We downloaded a copy of Tyler's schedule to share with them.  My father -in-law was especially thrilled and proud that Tyler would be able to meet some astronauts at the Air and Space Museum while waiting to go out onto the Mall on Tuesday.  They sat and had quite a talk about that opportunity alone and made plans to get together when Tyler got back to talk about just how cool it really was.  As we continued our drive to the Hilton, Gaithersburg, Tyler talked alot about getting back and showing his Pappy the pictures of the astronauts and sharing that experience with him. (He will never get to do that as he did not get to the museum until well after the astronauts had left.)

When I dropped Tyler off at the hotel I was pleased.  Of course, all the parents and scholars were excited and the staff was enthusiastic.  I left my son there feeling that he was safe and would be chaperoned in the manner I was promised he would be by all the correspondence your organization provided me, as well as both the conference calls I listened too.

Just hours later that evening, my disappointment started to build for my son and the other scholars attending the conference.  Dinner was quick and horrible and the busses were late to take them to hear Eric Weihenmayer.  While he enjoyed hearing Eric tremendously, it took hours to get on a bus and finally get moving to return to the hotel. I told him to just hang in there, it would get better.  He was simply exhausted already on the first night.

After a few hours of sleep, he and his roommate got up on time and were offered a bagged breakfast for the bus.  He ate some of it, but said that it was really pretty bad.  Again, trouble with the busses and getting everyone on them.  Finally, he made it to hear Colin Powell speak, but apparently even Colin Powell had to wait for the CYLC to get it together and started his speach later than scheduled.  I'm not part of your organization, but even I was emabarrassed to hear that COLIN POWELL had to wait for you!

After the speech, they headed to the Uof MD for classroom time.  Tyler said it was overcrowded and not a lot of learning happened.  He did say, however, that his FA, Hobbs, was amazing.  Had it not been for this one person trying to keep the kids spirits up, I'm sure the trip would have been much worse for Tyler. 

Again, a bagged lunch, with expired tastless food. Followed by the news that the weather was too bad for them to go to the opening ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial.  Everyone knew this was not the truth as the weather wasn't that cold, even posted on your own web-site and, besides, we were told time and again, to pack warmly for the weather.  Tyler was, of course, very upset by this, but then he spent hours on a bus again to get back to his hotel.  At first he was told they would watch the opening ceremony on TV as a group, but then later texted me saying they had to go to their rooms and stay there for several hours.  No learning, no watching the ceremony, no experience we were promised. 

Bored to tears and terribly disappointed, my son was happy to board the bus for dinner.  He said he had a great pasta meal, but he was starving and was only allowed to eat one serving.  Up until that dinner, my son had 1/2 a muffin, an apple, and a bag of pretzels because the bagged lunches were so awful.  He called me that night and said he was going to order room service from the hotel because he was so hungry.

Monday, again a bad and miniscule breakfast.  Tired and hungry, he made it to the cruise, where there was a buffet set up.  He said the selections were not great, but he actually had to fight his way through to get at the food because, apparently, he wasn't the only child still hungry.  The cruise was fine and he enjoyed Al Gore's speech and the screening of The Third Monday in October that day.  So aside from being tired and hungry, Monday was probably his best day.  He was tired when he went to bed, but excited about the events on Tuesday.

By far, Tuesday was the worst day of all.  Wasn't this the day we really paid for?  Wasn't this where all the promises we had been made supposed to come true?  Wasn't this the day that Tyler would talk about with enthusiasm and pride when he returned home? Nope, it sure wasn't.

I didn't talk to Tyler early in the morning, because I knew he'd be excited and busy, so I waited for him to call me.  At 8:14 AM my phone rang and I almost had tears in my eyes waiting to hear his excitement bursting through the phone line.  Instead I was greeted by a crushed voice saying Mom, I missed the astronauts.  Some other scholars overslept and we have to wait for them to be able to even leave.  WHAT? Why should those scholars up and ready on time have had to wait and miss out on that experience is my question to you? We were assured that there was enough staff on hand to handle any situation.  Certainly, someone could have been available to work with the latecomers.  Those on time never should have missed that opportunity.  My son still has not talked to his Pappy about this situation.  I heard the tears in his voice that day, and I certainly did not pay for that! I told Tyler to keep his chin up and move forward with the day.  He still was going to witness the President taking the oath of office, and that is a pretty incredible thing.  His enthusiasm was definately down, but he said, he would keep moving forward.  

I did not hear back from Tyler again until almost 3 PM.  In the meantime, I watched the inauguration on TV and was thrilled that my son was standing somewhere in that crowd.  I hoped that the moments was having there were making up for the disappointments he had experienced in his trip so far.  I sat with my daughter and showed her on a map of the mall where her brother was to be standing.  We cheered for him and were a little jealous of the experience he was having.  It didn't take more that a minute of talking to Tyler to realize the experience he had.  Instead of walking out of the Air and Space museum onto the Mall as we had anticipated, he had to walk pretty much the length of the Mall closer to the Washington Monument to listen to the inauguration.  He couldn't even see a jumbo-tron.  He was scared from being pushed and shoved along with the crowd.  He practically attached himself to the side of his FA and didn't move.  God bless that man is all I have to say.  The group tried to keep their spirits up, focusing on the fact that they were THERE, even though it wasn't what they had expected to happen.  After fighting their way to the bus, they sat on it for HOURS waiting for the roughly 50 scholars who were missing.  Again, they were not fed for hours and many kids were sick to their stomachs because of being upset and hungry. The parade came and went and my son was on a bus, hungry.  Yet another promise not kept.  At this point, Tyler didn't care about even going to the gala event.  He just wanted to eat something and come home.  Being mom, I tried to raise his spirits, but I ended up leaving the conversation with him still being upset and angry.

Finally, at 9 PM, and hour and a half after the gala was to start, my son was there.  The food was sparce and the picture I spent an extra $80 to have taken there never was.  I have heard everything from the cameras overheating to the fire marshal shutting it down because of overcrowding. 

 I know I'll never know the truth, but to say I'm upset is being beyond mild.  We paid $2440 for the conference itself.  Then we bought the shirt and scarf required for another $50 or so , even though they never even wore the scarf. Plus $80 for the picture that was never taken. That's $2570 plus clothes to meet the dress code and travel.  We paid that money expecting your organization to deliver what it had promised.  You certainly did not do that.  Fortunatley our son never got seperated from his group and THANK GOD I chose to drive him instead of leaving him in the hands of your staff to find his way around the airport on his own.  You endangered children, did not supervise or care for them properly.  But you sure took in alot of money.  Aside from the three speakers my son saw, you did not execute any portion of this trip in the way you said you would.  My son is now back and embarrassed to talk to his classmates, teachers, friends, and family about this experience.  What is he to say? My parents paid almost $3000 for me to see the inside of a bus? People paid $27 for a metro ticket and had more of an experience than you provided for a good many of the scholars attending this conference.

I have contacted every person I know in education, especially those I know who nominate students for your programs. I have told them this is not a safe program and shared our experience with them as well as others we have learned about since our return.  Tyler will never attend another conference sponsored by or associated in any way with your organization.  And what a shame.  You got greedy and took on more than you could handle for the sake for money.  My son will never get this experience back.  He is being as positive as he can about it, focusing on the things he did get to see and do, and for that I am most proud of him.  He is a leader of tomorrow and you have taught him a lesson he will not soon forget.  Greed spoils everything it touches.

As with many other parents, I feel that you need to immediatley refund the money we paid to you.  You did not provide what you promised and what I paid for. I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future.



Respectfully,



Susan Gilroy

This is the letter I did send...





Dear Ms Harris,



I am writing to you in regards to my son Tyler’s experience at the recent Jr Presidential Youth Inaugural Conference.  My husband and I have spent the last several days reflecting on the experience with input from our son.  To say we were disappointed would be a terrible understatement, but based on the feedback I have seen this is quite likely somewhat less than a surprise to you.

Let me start with some background.  My son has attended two conferences in the past, the JrNYLC in the summer of 2007 and the alumni conference in Boston last summer.  Both of these conference provided an extraordinarily safe and event filled growth experience that were worth every penny of the hefty price tag.  We could not have been happier that Tyler’s teacher saw enough in him to nominate him for such an event. 

For the last year, our son has fervently followed the presidential election process.  He has volunteered his time and written articles for school reflecting on the process and his experience getting involved.  This trip to the inauguration was the expected highlight of the year.

Based on our experience with your conference we had no reservations about sending our son even though the cost of this conference was quite large in comparison to previous events.  We expected the same level of team building, leadership opportunities and growth that had come from the previous conferences.  The speakers scheduled on the agenda were stunning and would certainly give plenty of material for the group discussions.

We, however, were surprised by a slew of horror stories, all along trying to keep Tyler’s spirits high so he could get the most of the event, which was sure to come.  Some of the disturbing thing we heard included hours on idling buses, missed meals, late meals, substandard food, missing scholars,  skipped sessions and a general sense of disorganization. 



As bad as that may sound, it was not the worst.  The following things we feel are inexcusable.

1. Missing the opening ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial; dismissed as a weather problem even though the weather was not unordinary severe and Tyler had packed for cold weather as instructed.
2. Missing the opportunity to meet the astronauts, dismissed as the lateness of some scholars, should not have meant that my son was punished when he was ready on time.
3. The lack of replacement activities instead of the opening ceremony; the children were sent to their hotel room not to return for several hours. 
4. Disorganization at the inauguration; although we were told on a conference call that there would be a viewing area directly outside the museum the children ended up hiking to a much more remote location.  Our son was able to stay with his FA, but missed the majority of the proceedings while they were trying to find a place. He couldn’t even see a jumbo-tron, he was so far away.
5. Early closing of the gala by the Fire Marshall; although we cannot get a clear answer about this, maybe you can help, the gala was cut short and my son missed the picture for which we paid $80.00.  And that was after spending the bulk of the evening in line waiting for the photographer.  This was not the experience expected nor the experience for which I paid.
Tyler was devastated when he missed the astronauts.  He had talked about this for hours with his grandfather, a former Air Force aviator, about this experience.  He was so excited this was his whole focus for the days leading up to the conference.  When he called and told us he missed the event because someone slept in we could hear him crying over the phone.

To summarize, we were assured over the phone that the conference staff would be able to handle the huge number of scholars that were expected and everyone would get the experience for which they paid.  There would be a great learning experience for all and an event that will be part of history!  After spending hours waiting on buses or being shuffled to hotel rooms, overcrowded classes, and missed or cancelled events, I think the only lesson learned was one of greed.  The result is that there were more scholars than could be handled. In fact there was an approximately 3000% increase in participation from the last inaugural conference based on the numbers that I have.

I feel that you did not provide the conference for which I paid and bordered on endangering my child in the process.  I am requesting the return of the money I paid to the conference as well as $500 for associated expenses incurred for a total of $3070.00.  I want someone to contact me regarding this matter on or before Friday January 30, 2009.  I would like to have an explanation for the poor experience as well as an understanding of when we can expect the refund.  If we do not hear from you and come to an agreement on how to correct this problem, we will seek legal representation to protect our interests.  Please understand that is not our preference but with limited channels of communication it may be our only option.



Regards,



Susan Gilroy

Ms. Delise,



I will send you a complaint form to fill out and send back in to me, or you can go online to <http://www.ncdoj.gov/>www.ncdoj.gov, go under Consumer protection, then click on Filing a Complaint and print out the Consumer Complaint form.  I need copies of any supporting documents like what kinds of claims the box makes about providing service.  I will then contact the company with the complaint.  I need the address for the company if you have it.  If you do not I can look it up.

Address: 433 Hunters Glen Lane, Hendersonville, NC 28739

Email: ncstitches@att.net

Subject: Digital Conversion

Comment: After much research and reading Consumer Reports, I opted for the Tivax, STB-T9 converter box which received good reviews. I finally got it hooked up to my 13" TV. (I haven't attempted the 27" yet with DVD and VCR.) In accordance with the instructions, the Converter Box scanned for channels. It came up with two channels - ABC (Channel 13) and PBS. Apparently, I have now lost NBC and CBS. NBC and CBS are not strong channels, however, I was able to receive them. It seems terribly unfair for viewers to have to forfeit some channels in addition to paying for a converter box. This is not something that I have read about. I recently lost my job (like many) so I am not in a position to pay for cable TV. I realize that the conversion has been postponed until June, however, I will have to deal with this sooner or later. Do I simply sit back and accept the fact that I will no longer be able to view two major channels? Thanks very much!!!

Dear Mr. Pennisi,



Thank you for your recent correspondence to the North Carolina Attorney General’s office. The questions that you ask about privacy matters are all good questions and we encourage people to ask these questions to anyone that are requesting information. We can not stop companies from requesting personal information if they can justify needing that information to conduct business with you. Certainly it appears that any agency that is lending money would require certain financial background information on you. Some questions you are perfectly entitled to ask would be who sees this information, how is it protected, how long do you maintain these records? The hard part of this scenario is that the consumer must be willing to walk away from the deal if he/she is not satisfied with the answers. However, this agency does encourage people to do just that if they do not feel safe proceeding with the agency.



In you e-mail you commented that you felt more comfortable with a website that ended in .gov instead of .com. The important thing to look for is in the address bar at the top of the page. It should start with https:// when transmitting personal information instead of the more common http://. That extra ‘s’ indicates that the information will be delivered from your computer to theirs in encrypted form. Never transmit personal or financial information via e-mail, it is not a secure enough method.



We wish you luck in your application process.

How is this possible?? (See below) Consumer Protection cannot be on extended leave…I called the 1-877-566-7226 number and was directed to voicemail…



I initially sent the following email to the consumer protection division,



“I am concerned about the type of personal financial information I am being asked for by the Collegeboard CSS Profile (Collegeboard.com). This Profile is required by some universities (UNC for example) to determine financial aid eligibility for my child. My concern is that this Profile is in addition to FAFSA which is a federal .gov form and website (I am more comfortable with the .gov). Collegeboard.com is a commercial site - and they ultimately want your completed tax returns! Who governs their activities and what PII protection laws apply? Can they sell my information? What security do they have in place to protect my data from hacking and theft? Why do colleges need anything more than the FAFSA form? Most of us do what we are told and trust that everything is being properly taken care of... The average family needs as much help as they can get to send their children to college and will provide this type of information thinking they are do what is required. I am very uncomfortable with providing the financial data requested to a commercial website and want someone in a position of authority to tell me that it is legitimate.”



This is a real concern considering the current environment of identity theft. All PUBLIC Universities in NC should be required to use FAFSA for their needs based evaluations.



In addition to taking all of your personal financial data, Collegeboard.com charges you to provide it to the universities…something is wrong with this. What will they do with this massive financial data base in the future?

Hi Susan,



Our engineering staff checked Mr. Cain’s location for availability of service today.  He is almost three miles from the nearest point from which service can be extended and there are only 11 potential customers along that route, apparently he lives in a sparsely populated area.     Our local team will make contact with him and explain the situation.  The cost is significant and unlikely he would be willing to pay what would be required to extend service to his home. 



There are some alternatives available to him and he may have looked at them already.  For example, his local phone company may offer DSL, also most wireless company’s have a broadband product and broadband is now available ubiquitously in NC via satellite from Hughes.



Please let me know if you have any questions.

Ms. Bray:

We don’t recommend contacting supposed companies that advertise grants or grant assistance packages.  The vast majority of these types of grant offerings are not legit.  While grants are available for education, some small business (w/restrictions) & organizations/programs for the benefit of the public, there’s always a red flag if the ad references grants to pay off debt, to refinance a home, etc. it is a scam.  Those that offer to send you a package to assist you in getting a grant will often not send what they promise after charging you for it, or what they send is not helpful or accurate information to obtain a grant.

If you come across a particular company advertising such grants, feel free to e-mail it to us or call & we will look into, however as stated above, it’s a good rule of thumb that all these advertisements for such grants are not legit.

Mr. Randy Cain,

Time Warner said that there are not enough homes (11) that would be serviced 3 miles from the nearest point for service, even if all of them want the service, for them to spend the significant money to extend their service to your area.  Also Mr. Stanley said that he did not figure you would want to spend the money required to bring the service to your home.  Under the new law, cable and video companies with State-issued franchises are not required to "build-out" their franchises.  In other words, companies with State-issued franchises are generally not required to provide service in any particular areas.  Therefore, we do not have the authority to tell companies where they must provide service.  I wrote to Mr. Stanley to get the particulars on if services were available, if they would be available soon, and/or what are the particular issues that keep it from being available to your home.  I am sorry that our office was not able to get you a better outcome.

To whom it concerns,

I was insulted when Mrs. Davis referred &quot;since he contacted&quot;,nstead of using my name. That was so unprofessional.

I contacted the Governor&#39;s office because I have been given constant runarounds.

Secondly I have exhausted all my resources for alternatives without results. I have tried hughes and it was very poor quality internet.

Thirdly Time Warner advertise service on radio and television. But guess its only for Americans fortunately enough that dwells in heavy populated areas, not for Amerecans that unfortunately dwell in sparesly areas which was so elegantly stated by Jack.

I think its unfair and Time Warner needs to change their advertisements to &quot;Not for Americans that lives in sparesly areas&quot;.

Please reconsider and provide your service for us also, we really want it in our Community .

Respectively,

Randy J. Cain

The digital conversion itself was mandated by Congress and the FCC.  It was a policy decision made at the federal level, not at the state level; there’s nothing we can do about that policy decision.  If her complaint is with the federal government for instituting the digital conversion program, her best recourse is to complain to the FCC or one of her federal elected representatives, i.e., the Senators from N.C. (Senator Hagan and Senator  Burr) and/or her particular Congressman or Congresswoman.

Susan, thanks for your reply, however, I think you have missed my point.  My complaint is not against the Tivax Box, but rather against the government for instituting a program such as this.  Apparently, the box is unable to pick up the stations with the weaker signals, although I can pick them up without a converter box.  I don't view this as a problem with Tixax.  Channel 4, NBC, was kind enought to respond to my email.  I was told that I may need an antenna, rather than using my rabbit ears.  At this point in time, I do not have the funds to purchase an antenna and pay someone to install it.



I did complete the online form and mail it out today.



Thank you.

> Comment: After much research and reading Consumer Reports, I opted for the Tivax, STB-T9 converter box which received good reviews. I finally got it hooked up to my 13" TV. (I haven't attempted the 27" yet with DVD and VCR.) In accordance with the instructions, the Converter Box scanned for channels. It came up with two channels - ABC (Channel 13) and PBS. Apparently, I have now lost NBC and CBS. NBC and CBS are not strong channels, however, I was able to receive them. It seems terribly unfair for viewers to have to forfeit some channels in addition to paying for a converter box. This is not something that I have read about. I recently lost my job (like many) so I am not in a position to pay for cable TV. I realize that the conversion has been postponed until June, however, I will have to deal with this sooner or later. Do I simply sit back and accept the fact that I will no longer be able to view two major channels? Thanks very much!!!

Subject: Dangerous product advertised on radio (The Phantom)

Comment: There is a product called "The Phantom" that is being advertised on Rock 92.3 that I can only HOPE will be banned in every state. They claim to be able to scramble police radars so that people can speed without getting a ticket, and that it has been banned in 10 states. My fear is that ANY driver, but especially young & inexperienced drivers will get this and think they are indestructable, putting all other drivers in danger. I want to feel safe when I get in my car, and this product has absolutely NO business being on the market. PLEASE STOP THIS BEFORE SOMEBODY GETS HURT. It could be you or someone in YOUR family.

My mother has been dealing with Sears Department store for several years now.  Her account was used to put false credit on it.  I have been trying to pay off this debt of over $3,000, paying $60.00 a month for credit that should not have been put on this account in the first place.  Now at 85 I have been using her social security check to pay the $60.00 a month.  The collection service Central Credit Service is harassing me and telling me that I used my mothers account for my personal use.  This is not true and I feel that this company should be investigated to see how many other people are being falsely accursed.  They state that they will not take the $60.00 a month any longer.  That they want $1,500.00 up front.  My mother does not have that kind of money and can't afford an attorney and I don't appreciate them accusing me of using my mothers account.  She is very ill and do not need for these people to contact her and harass her.  Please let me know what can be done about this situation.

Dear Mrs. Cherry,



Thank you for your recent inquiry to the North Carolina Attorney General’s office. Unfortunately we will not be able to investigate Experian as you requested. The law does not stipulate that they credit agencies must provide a credit score to consumer’s. You are entitled to see your credit report and make corrections to any incorrect information. You may do this for free once per year at <http://www.annualcreditreport.com/>www.annualcreditreport.com. However this does not mean that they must furnish you wit a credit score. If you have incorrect information on your credit report please file a dispute with the credit bureau and include any supporting documentation that you feel could be used as proof of your claim. The credit bureau will have 30 days to investigate your claim and respond to you with the results. If you do not feel your inquiry has been satisfactorily investigated, please feel free to file a complaint with our office and we can write to the credit bureau, hopefully with better results.



Very truly Yours,



David Fox

Subject: Experian Credit Reporting Agency

Comment: From June 11, 2003 until Feburary 14, 2009 consumers like us were able to purchase all three of our credit scores from www.myfico.com/12. Consumers were empowered to see the same information as Mortgage Lenders. As of 02/14/2009 Experian is no longer co-operating, and I think their decision is based on control and greed. To make more money they plan to sell false credit scores and false credit monitoring services to unknowing consumers. In our case we want to purchase a home. With the problem mentioned above and Experion not co-operating with our "Credit Attorney's" we have hired to monitor our credit we will never be able to purchase a home. Also, I had a Student Loan which was Discharged March 31,2008 due to Disability as of Janurary 27, 2003. This discharge "a combined account" is listed on my credit report along with "Every Department of Education Facility that handles Government Loan and My Loan was Transferred to during it's existence including the Originating Bank". In my opinion this is a Duplication of information making my Experian Credit Report (22) pages long and lowering my credit score. Please have someone to investigate Experian. Thank You

Subject: Law Enforcement Certification



Mr. Doucette,



Your below inquiry sent to the Governor’s Office has been forwarded to my attention.  In addition, I responded to Rep. Ric Killian’s office last week regarding an inquiry you sent to his office. 



First, I need to point out that the information you included in your e-mail is not correct.  Your law enforcement certification has not been suspended and your military service is not being ignored.  As you know, all sworn officers must complete 24 hours of in-service training each calendar year in order to maintain their certification.  The NC Criminal Justice Education and Training Standards Commission does recognize and value the service of the certified men and women who are called to active duty.  Officers who are members of the National Guard or Reserves and are unable to complete the training due to deployment may receive a waiver of the training until they return to duty with their agency.  Our records indicate that your agency, the Charlotte Douglas International Airport Police, requested a military waiver on your behalf in January 2008 for calendar year 2007 training.  That waiver was granted and your certification was not suspended.  In January of this year a representative of your agency reported that you had returned to duty and asked that the waiver be lifted.  Your agency did not provide the necessary documentation at that time to verify that you had returned from active duty and had completed the training.  Officers who are issued a waiver may not perform law enforcement duties until they have satisfied the in-service training requirements.



As a result of a request from this office, we did receive part of documentation needed in order to lift the waiver.  However, we have since made a second request to Ms. Babette Boone, Administrative Officer at your agency, for documentation that has not been submitted.   According to your file, the agency has not provided verification of your completion of the required hours of firearms training and qualification.  As soon as that documentation is submitted, we can lift the waiver so you can return to duty.  We provide a notice of in-service training requirements every year to all law enforcement agencies, to include the steps necessary to clear officers to return to duty after they have received a waiver from training.  Those procedures have not changed.  I would suggest that you contact the appropriate person(s) within your agency in order to determine the status of the training documentation needed.



I trust this explains the current status of your certification and the reasons for the delay in lifting the waiver to allow you to return to duty.

Visitor: Mr. Keith Doucette

Address: 16230 Hayfield Road, Charlotte, NC 28213

Email: kbdoucette@yahoo.com

Subject: Problem with Criminal Justice and Standards Commission

Comment: I recently completed a 10 month tour overseas on active duty in the US Air Force. On January 15th, I was notified by the North Carolina Criminal Justice and Standards Commission that my law enforcement certificate was being suspended. They requested a copy of my DD214 proving I served on Military service. Once they received that form my certification they said would be reinstated. Well as you can see it is March 4th and I am still waiting for them to reinstate my certification. I am a 15 year veteran of law enforcement and I work for the City of Charlotte as a Police Officer. I have deployed before and have never had a problem with the commission. Once I returned to work I completed all training that was required of me to complete from the period of my absence. Upon returning I also completed fire arms training to bring that up to date. It is just very frustrating that I go to the Middle East and serve my country and this is what the State of NC does to us. It is not only me but another officer I work with and three fellow CMPD officers who are all going through this crap. It is costing me money not being able to perform my duties as a police officer. If there is any way you could bring this concern to the Attorney General of NC or whoever else may be able to assist, it would be greatly appreciated. I don not feel I should be punished for serving my country.
