Subject: not to sure

Comment: Hi, My name is John Wiechel, me and my older brother, have been trying to locate our father, for several years now. About 3 months ago, I got a call from a Bank in Kansas, telling us that, my father was left some money, from a aunt of his, but they can't find him anywhere, and wanted to know, if we knew of where he might be. Well from then, they told us that we could get the money that was left to him, if we could show proof that he has passed away. Well me, and my family, and his side of the family, we haevnt heard from him in over 20 years, no addresses, phone numbers...anything. What i am wanting to know, is there a dead line, for someone to stay missing, that a date, can be drawn up, of him passing away? We cant get his SSN, i have the first 5 digits of it, but cant get the last 4. What im getting at is, if we cant show a date, of when he has passed away, or if he has passed away, then the money goes to the state of Kansas. I feel that, me and my brother should be able to get this, since he was never in our life, or even tried to make contact, and he has never paid child support, i am 23 now, and my brother is 28. So is there a way, to say he has passed away, or anything like that? Im not sure how needs to read this, or if you guys, could do anything about this. But if you can, please contact me back, and let me know. Thanks and hope to hear from you soon. John Wiechel My fathers name is Martin Eric Wiechel. I think his Date of Birth Is 09/27/1954. Once again, thank you

Email: betheajuanita@hotmail.com

Subject: seeking Information

Comment: Hello: My name is Juanita Bethea and I live at 4825-205 Tanager Park Dr ; Ivy Hollow Apartments in Charlotte my phone number is (704) 509-6119; and I'm desperately seeking help in the upmost urgency: I only have couple more days and I will be in the street with on where to go!!!I would like information on how I can get help about the laws and rights of a renter I live in Charlotte North Carolina. It seems that every other month I am begging my property manager to let me stay in the unit that I rent. I pay my rent I've never skipped any months, however I may have been late a quite few times,but I always paid the late fee and the cost of court. this was a tactic that they used in order to make me move. Now as we approach the holiday seasons I received a letter from the regional manager of Tribute property that I have thirty (30) days to move. I got this letter on December 15, 2008. It stated that I violated my lease, I don't think that this is right. I need someone to help me with this since I don't receive rental assistance with my rent. I have called legal aid to find out if they could help. That was not an option, since I don't receive rental assistance. What rights do I have a renter? Does this means my property manager can do this and there is nothing I can do about it? This is what everyone is telling me, I have no rights as a renter to live at this apartment community I have not done anything wrong first they tell me my son can't use the common area and my other son that does not live with me whatever he does affect my housing situation. With the housing market the way it is, what about the renter? It seem that this would create more homeless in the city. I have spoke with the Assistance manager and all she said to; when was I going to turn in my keys! I really don't have anywhere to go and with no rights as a renter. 1. I've lived in this apartment complex for four years. 2. My rent was acceptable for the month of January with late fees did not whether or not to pay; a notice was sent that I needed to pay. 3. Afraid of retaliation from my Property Manager Maria Lopez for trying to find out about my rights as a renter. 4. Property Manager Maria Lopez (704)598-9393 or/ (704) 606-2482 5. I am unemployed and receiving benefit and this is putting me in a stress mode knowing that I will be Homeless. I know there are other things more pressing that this,we are in an economic recession. any assistance would be greatly appreciated Thank you Juanita Bethea EVICTIONS FOR CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES - Article 7 of Chapter 42 In North Carolina, both public and private landlords can evict or remove persons from residential rental property who are involved in criminal activity. The criminal activity is not limited to drug offenses but all criminal activity that threatens the health, safety or right of peaceful enjoyment of the entire premises. In addition, landlords have the authority to evict a tenant for allowing any person to re-enter the premises after that person has been banned by the housing authority or the court. Landlords are also allowed to collect rent even if they know about the criminal activity. A waiver defense is not available to tenants in actions brought under Article 7. There is an expedited procedure established for evicting tenants involved in criminal activity. Landlords have the option of either filing these actions in Small Claims Court, as is done with summary ejectment complaints now, or in District Court. Cases in District Court must be set for trial 30 days after service of the complaint or appeal from Small Claims Court. Unless there are extraordinary reasons, no extensions of time to file court papers are allowed, continuances or postponements of the trial are restricted, and all time periods for filing pleadings are shortened. In addition, if a case is appealed from Small Claims Court to District Court, and the tenant does not file an answer to the landlord’s complaint within 20 days, the landlord can move for an entry of default pursuant to Rule 55 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. 6 Article 7 also authorizes "partial evictions." This allows landlords to selectively evict individual household members and guests without evicting the entire family. The bill also gives judges the authority to order "partial evictions" if the tenant who signed the lease was not involved in the criminal activity and either: 1. "did not know or have reason to know" that the activity was occurring or would likely occur; or 2. has done everything that could be reasonably expected to, to prevent the criminal activity - such as requesting the offending household member be removed from the lease and making reports to law enforcement authorities. VI. When the tenant seeks to enforce their rights… Just as you, the landlord, has rights under the law. The tenants have rights too. When a tenant seeks to enforce their rights, you should be cautious that you do not respond with attempting to evict them. Such action would be illegal and you may have to pay the tenant damages. Retaliatory Evictions (N.C.G.S. 42-37.1) A. The following tenant activities are protected by the law: 1. Complaining or requesting that the landlord make repairs; 2. Complaining to the housing inspector, health department or any other government agency about repair needs or unhealthy conditions; 3. Any complaint to a landlord from the housing inspector, health department or other government agency; 4. Any honest attempt of the tenant to enforce their rights under the lease or under state or federal law, such as filing a lawsuit and 5. Any honest attempt to organize, join or become involved with any group of people who are trying to help tenants. B. Eviction is a remedy, if the tenant has breached the lease: A landlord cannot evict a tenant in retaliation for doing any of these protected activities. But the landlord can evict for not paying rent or for breaking the lease in any other way, if the lease says that the tenant can be evicted for that particular violation. C. What are the consequences of evicting a tenant in retaliation for protected activity? A tenant may be able to regain possession of the premises and have a claim for money damages. The damages may include loss of personal property, lost wages, cost of moving belongings, mental suffering, and other damages.

Comment: I have a plan to produce the first commercial viable power unit, THE GREEN URBAN MOBLE POWER PLANT (GUMPP) (consists of a mobile rechargeable battery pack, rear drive and one handed steering joystick,) which will allow users to switch out attachments as required for their chosen task. GCDG will help governmental agencies and commercial companies keep up with and/or exceed mandated reduction of airborne and ozone pollutants. Since one five horsepower push mower motor will pollute more in 20 hours than a brand new car will produce in 26,000 miles, we will replace currently used gasoline or diesel powered equipment with "The GUMPP" a battery to capacitor hybrid or "The Gwaz", battery / LP gas hybrid systems. The Problem: Federal, State, and Local governments in the USA and Countries worldwide are seeking solutions to reducing air borne pollutants caused by the fuel burned by gasoline combustion engines, for the health of its citizens and the environment. Mission Statement: Green Cycle Design Group (GCDG) will help create and promote a healthy and cleaner environment by supplying industry with products to reduce or eliminate polluting emissions by replacing current fossil fueled equipment with renewable and/or cleaner energy. GCDG seeks to reduce USA's dependence on foreign fuel resources protect our national interest.

Subject: shortfall in employee pension fund

Comment: Dear Gov. Purdue, This is a response from an email that I sent to the state treasurer's office yesterday regarding the solicitation of funds to make up the shortfall in the employees' pension fund. As a private sector employee for more than 20 years, all of that with entrepreneurial companies, I have never had the benefit of a long term pension plan. If the state wants to play on Wall Street than it's employees should play and pay like the rest of us. It's not realistic to expect to win all of the time and since the treasury is "touting" how well it was run in the past, they should except their 20% shortfall and get on with it. If they don't want to do that, then stop playing the stock market and use a safe vehicle like the rest of us have to. Less risk = less return; more risk=more return. I will not vote to support any individual that makes me pay twice in taxes, especially when I have never had the benefit of having a plan in the private sector. Dear Ms. Sink: My name is Tony Solari. I am the Government Affairs director for the state Treasurer’s office. First, let me thank you for writing to us regarding the issue of the state employee pension fund. Our democracy would work much better if more good citizens like you took time to communicate with elected officials. Treasurer Cowell was in my office last night and I read her your email word for word. We share your concern about the pension fund, and especially over the losses it has incurred over the last several months. In regards to that issue, let me make a couple of points. 1. North Carolina has a long history of conservative stewardship over its pension fund, a tradition that Treasurer Cowell will continue. Because of that tradition, North Carolina’s pension fund has done relatively well during this economic downturn. If you ranked all the states according to the amount their pension funds have lost, North Carolina would be among those that lost the LEAST amount during the past year. 2. Our investment strategy is very carefully considered and is designed to maximize the return and minimize risks. It was this strategy that kept our losses relatively modest. We have not nor will we ever take reckless chances or engage in risky investment strategies with the funds entrusted to us. 3. State employees are among the hardest working, most dedicated people you will ever meet. They work long hours for much less pay and fewer benefits than they could get in the private sector. One of the few inducements they have to stay in public service is their pension. In North Carolina we have a “defined benefits” system which guarantees retirees a minimum pension. Please believe me when I say that this benefit does not come close to comparing to those you might see in the private sector, but at least our hard working employees can count on a specific amount each month when they retire. Without this benefit, the state would have a very difficult time recruiting and retaining the people we need to teach our children, repair our roads, pay out unemployment checks and perform all the other services that North Carolina’s citizens have come to expect. 4. Since we do have a defined benefits system the law states that public employees who retire are entitled to their pension. The law therefore REQUIRES the state legislature to keep the pension system solvent and to make up any shortfall that comes to exist in it. North Carolina is not different than many other states in this regard. We sympathize with the losses that you and many others have incurred with regard to their retirement funds during this economic downturn. Rest assured that we will do all in our power to be careful stewards of the public funds entrusted to us. That is our job and our pledge to you, the taxpayers of North Carolina. I hope that this short email helps explain recent events and our obligation to keep the pension fund solvent. Thank you again for writing to us. Yours, Anthony Solari

Subject: NC Economy - Employment

Comment: If I could take back my vote for Governor Purdue, I would do so. She hasn't been in office for a month and has already proven she is a liar. She states she plans to get the economy back on track. A good start is to freeze state funded jobs! I applied for two secretarial positions as Surry Community College and just got a letter that Governor Purdue issued "Executive Order No. 6" freesing the positions. I have been unemployed for four months and have a notebook an inch thick of positions I have applied for with no results. Unemployment is out of hand in this state and all over the country. My position in textiles no longer exists because of the competition from foreign countries and now our own Governor is eliminating jobs! Thanks for the kick in the behind! Trust me, when she comes up for re-election, she will definitely not get my vote. It is bad enough that you know candidates are lying when they are running, but worse when they take food out of our mouths the first month in office. She should be ashamed of herself!

Subject: where to go

Comment: I am single mother of 2, drawing unemployment, this is my last recourse, to actually contact your office. I have a mortgage, car, and kids. That is it and that is all I want to try and keep. I want someone to send me a list of grant programs like the community block grants and such, that I can seek help from at this time. I have noticed that if someone does not internet search all day everyday looking for jobs and looking for help that some of these programs, well frankly are secrets and people do not know they are out there. I pay my taxes and pay into these so therefore, can someone please send me a download or email of programs or grants that me as an individual can apply for help. Individual grants for a single mother of 2 that all I want is a job and to keep my home. There are grants available but when you go try to find them, one you have to pay or 2 there scams. Please send me grant as that I can apply for to help me. Also is there anyway someone from the State Treasury can help me workout a plan to suspend my mortgage payments for 3 to 4 months while I am trying to find a job. I know there was some sort of plan to stop foreclosure but with kids, I cant take a chance and get to that point. Also if American Recovery is approved in February, I am getting ready to go on State extended benefits, will I be able to flip and go back to the federal extensions. Also the way this looks is we can draw unemployment until December 2009, if it is passed. One more thing, my benefit year ends in March and I will have to file new claim, when someone has been out of work and even on federal extension, why can't Purdue stop temporarily another waiting week, I should not have another waiting week when the economy is this bad just because paper work wise it is a new claim, if someone has drawn federal extension we should not have another waiting week, I am sure you will hear more about this week again without pay when people realize their benefit year ends and they have to start over, I know 1 check may not be alot for some people but to me it is a power bill, school lunch, gas bill, water bill that all could be cut off because of "waiting week", anyone that is in the system and has been on federal benefits should not even have to file new claim because all the information is the same, why cant Purdue waive this for now as part of stimulus changes, I have been in system for a year and come March I do not know when I will receive my checks because of having to refile a new claim and waiting week, I am one "waiting week" away from losing everything I have. Can Govenor not veto this law temporarily due to all this downturn. Please respond and tell me where to start with grants and with the unemployment questions, will we be able to draw until December 2009 and can anything be done bout waiting week. I had no where else to ask so this time I decided to go straight to someone I voted in office, to help one of the ones that voted her in. Thank you and God Bless, please do not take this email personally, I just wanted to get information and I am very saddened and have no hope at this point, all I want is this home and my children to have a life to where we dont have to worry each month about someone taking it from us. thank you again.

Subject: Am I still proud of my country!

Comment: Good Morning: In the past, I have been financially able to support the Republican Party. Due to the economy, I am trying to keep my family from losing everything. I do have a few comments I would like to share with the committee. Last year, due to an enormous amount of debt and helping one of our daughters due to many health problems, we decided to go into a debt settlement program. This has been working well for us until now. Not only are my husband and I working, we are still trying to pay our bills. We pay taxes like most hard working citizens. The debt settlement office we are working with has been able to settle two of our debts. Then we receive a 1099 from Chase for the amount they wrote off. Now, we pay taxes on our paycheck to federal and state. Our hard earned money is put in the pot with the rest of the hard workers of this country. That money is taken to bail out these banks that have charging outrageous interest on all our credit cards to as much as 35%. Therefore, we can never get out of debt. Now our government, giving these banks millions, is allowing these same banks to put us in further debt by sending us a 1099 to add to our tax returns as earned income. We have a new problem now. How do we pay our taxes? The President wants the Republicans to back him. Why would I want to back anyone who looks out for the very corporations that are robbing us. I truly don't look to hear from anyone as I never have in the past. With the millions of hard working people losing their jobs every day, how do we expect them to survive when America has turned her back on us and continues to allow these banks to rip us off? I have a young friend who is a single parent with two small babies........will you support them if she loses her job? I have another friend whose husband lost his job, they can't pay their bills...............will you pay their bills for them? These are two, there are many more. My husband came home from a meeting yesterday and we both thanked God, he was lucky. Many of his counterparts and employees were not. The President is not the only person who was raised in poverty. Many of us were and chose to make a difference with our children. I have three girls that graduated from college. The first in our families. It took us 15 years to pay off these loans. These banks played a large part of the debt the Americans are in by charging these horrible interest rates. And yet they continue to give those ridiculous bonuses. I don't know how any of our representatives and bank officials sleep at night. Does anyone have a conscience? Does anyone really care? I am 59 years old with nothing to retire on because our investments were in our girls. Why won't our government hold these financial organizations accountable? They hold the citizens of this country accountable. I am more angry than any of you can ever imagine. I am disgusted with the majority of our elected officials. Finally, would any of these officials like to walk in our shoes? If I wasn't under these money pressures, I would be more than happy to make a donation. Would you like to make one to me and the other millions of people that are in my boat? WE NEED HELP! STOP THIS MADNESS...............SAVE THE HARD WORKING MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS WHO PAY YOUR SALARIES AND BONUSES!!! Thanks, Carolyn H.

Subject: Our Kids Need to GO Healthy

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: Have you looked around our communities? Nearly one out of every three children and adolescents are overweight or obese, making childhood obesity one of our nation's leading health threats. NC ranks 5th nationally in childhood obesity according to the Trust for America's Health 2008 F as in Fat report. Researchers suggest that the childhood obesity epidemic is also the result of a decline in regular physical activity. Too many young people have fallen into a sedentary lifestyle of long hours spent in front of a television or computer. To make matters worse, many schools are cutting back on traditional physical education programs because of budgetary concerns and competition from other academic demands. Our kids need and deserve the opportunity to be active during the day. If children don't get adequate physical education at school, the obesity epidemic condition will worsen and our children will be at a greater risk for heart disease and diabetes. Physical education is one of the most cost-effective steps that we can take to keep our kids healthy. We send our children to school to learn. We must require quality physical education in our schools so that we can empower our children with the knowledge they need to lead a healthy life. Much like reading - learning how to be physically active is a skill they will need to use every single day of the rest of their lives. September is Go Healthy Month - a time for kids to step up the plate as leaders in their communities to empower and inspire each other and their families to go health by being more physically active and eating healthier foods. As a legislative leader in our state, I call on you to "Go Healthy" for our kids and support requiring quality physical education within minimum standards in North Carolina's schools. Sincerely, Connie Raper Sincerely, Connie Raper 2614 Woodmont Dr Durham, NC 27705-2760

Subject: HB1077(2005-6) session S46(2007-8) Session

Comment: Dear Govenor Perdue, Since My son Hunter died at almot 32 weeks, I have taken action starting with HB1077 from 2005-6 session. We have not gotten anywhere due to one paticular Senator. I am working again on this upcoming session, and I am just Hunter's mom, and of 5 more boys. But I am begging for any help or advice you can give. I want to name it Hunter's Bill this year maybe for good luck, and in his memory. His short life began this exposistion in North Carolina and it would effect thousands of parents, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and grandparents alone. There is a new bill introduced S13 this session which equates this baby as significant enough for felenoy charges if injured, but in accident, like our son Hunter, he has no birth or death certificate, nor a name by your state. Please help us or please advise as to the issue. No state agency head I have found has opposition to this bill, but somone in the Senate does. It seams almost heartless to me, now I am ill at 37 years old and I need this. Thank you for your time in such a busy era. Regards, Heidi S. Leggett 336-624-4660

Subject: economy...etc..etc.

Comment: Do I understand that a pay raise has been given to some of the Representatives of this great Country? Has any of our representatives thought that maybe they should be taking a pay cut since there are so many Americans whom have no choice in whether they have jobs or their pay is being cut. We are all struggling here and it seems to most of us Americans that the government seems to be the one that are always staying afloat living high a mighty. Example ($500) hair cut. I cut hair for a living and there is no hair cut worth that. There are those that can't even make $500 a week or every two weeks. We American’s need to start taking a stand for this country that has been fought for so long. We stand by idle watching all of you make decisions that affect those of us trying to raise a family and we struggle on a daily basis. Something is not right and is not being planned well. The government has gotten too greedy and someone needs to fight for US! We read and hear things that make no sense to us. Basically it sounds like they are talking in circles and those of us that are not politically educated may not fully understand what is actually taking place, therefore we sit back doing nothing because we know of nothing to do. I am a mom of 4 children with one in College. My husband and I work very hard in trying to provide for our family. We cannot even save enough money that if he were to lose his job that we could survive for a while. So...tell me what you and the others can tell those of us that will actually make sense to me. All of you take a big pay cut and give back to the Americans who put you in office to begin with. Close all the boarders and quit letting everyone in to live in America Free and Clear not paying taxes etc.

Comment: I just don't understand that we pay sales tax, which I understand on our cable bill with Charter Comm. But also we have to pay almost $8.00 for a NC. Video Tax. What is this tax for, please explain this to me. Also I hope that you are not for this so called stimulus bill, that really is nothing more than a huge pay back to huge campaign contributions. Please tell me that I did not make a huge mistake in voting for you. Please speak up for our children that will have to pay this money back. If you do care you will stand against this useless spending. Thank You for your time. Kevin Connor, Hampstead, NC.

Comment: To Governor Perdue: I read in recent news article the following: "AP Investigation: Bailed-out banks sought to hire 21,800 foreign workers in past 6 years". I want to know what you're going to do about it as governor, since the HQ of 2 of the country's largest banks are here in Charlotte. What legal action can be taken against them on behalf of NC tax payers? Something should be done soon, as citizens of NC losing jobs and suffering greatly in this economic climate.

Comment: I am writing to protest a 32% increase in water and sewer rates ordered by subject commission (Docket No. W-778, Sub 81). This increase is exorbinant, particularly in view of our economic recession. The public hearing held in Lake Lure was a farce: the commission had apparently made up its mind about granting the increase to CWS Systems, Inc. Everyone at the hearing spoke against the increase, but to no avail. I request that you, Governor Perdue, reverse the order of the commission.

Subject: Vehicle and property tax

Comment: I cannot understand why our vehicle tax is based on the retail price of the vehicle and not the trade in value. We only see the retail value when we buy a vehicle. when we take the car off the lot it starts loosing value. I have a 9 yr old car and have to pay tax on it, like I am just buying it today. Real property tax: National value of our propery is down 23%. Are we going to have to pay tax like there is no diff in value? I live in Rural Warren County on a dirt road and cannot get mail delivery to my house. I cannot get county water and I cannot get cable tv or computer service. I think my property tax should reflect this. Please respond. Thank You Trudy Bookbinder tbook@hughes.net 252-456-2959 2/2/09

Subject: Gov Mansion Art

Comment: I am Master Sergeant Glenn Carter. I joined the USAF in Charlotte in 1986.My mother is a Dep Clerk in Wilmington. We grew up in Concord where my grandfather Glenn Roseman worked for Snyder Printing. I am trying to find an original piece of art that my grandmother had placed in the mansion in the 70's or early 80's. her pen name was Janie Phifer "Purveyer of the Gentile Arts" and she made pressed flower pictures with North Carolina wildflowers. I helped her pick and press them as a child. I believe the picture may have had a mirror with a pressed bouquet above it in a gold frame. Chances are, that nature has taken it's toll on the picture and some of the colors have faded. Janie Roseman passed away last fall, and we would like to know where the picture is. If it is still displayed, that is outstanding, but if it has been replaced, we would like to find it to have for a family treasure made by our grandmother. If you can help please contact me at the listed email, or my phone 618-649-9782. Most Respectfully, Glenn Carter

Subject: shelters for the homeless

Comment: I would like to know why they don't have a bail out to help the homeless? A lot of the programs in this city with a small few helping with food. Because we are now faced with an increase in in homeless. All this due to a poor economy and business closings. What do you plan to do for those that now pan handle to get a roof over thier heads. Which either gets them a room at a hotel or jail cell. There has to be a better way to deal with this problem thats growing everyday. I hope you can help our city and hopefully others, have a blesed day and a restful evening madom Governer.

Subject: How to contact congress and concerns

Comment: I have some concerns about the economy and I would like to voice my opinion to the democratic and republican party. I would like to know how I can contact them as individual senators and house of representatives. I'm not looking to send emails threw the democratic and republican web sites. I want to do send my email to each person. My other concern is with the state of North Carolina. I would like to know why you are taking away from the schools and other programs? When you take away from the schools you are hurting the childrens education and the future generation of america. I would like to know where our lottery money is going? It is advertised to go towards the schools but to the north carolina residents it seems to be disappearing. The state of South Carolina rewards 60% of the scratch off tickets back to there people. North Carolina rewards 40% back to there people. Where does the rest of the money go??

Subject: fayetteville police department corruption

Comment: 4 February 2009 Fayetteville Police Department (F.P.D.) Office of Professional Standards (O.P.S.) 467 Hay Street Fayetteville, NC 28301 Subject: F.P.D. HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION EVENTS Dear O.P.S.: My name is Gerry Lindgren, (574.52.0295; State of NC ID #39146496), and I am writing to report the recent harassment and discrimination events that I have received this past week from some of the F.P.D. officers and will forward a copy of this letter to my attorney, Governor Perdue, the A.C.L.U. and the U.S. Senate and Congress due to pending civil action against the Los Angeles Police Department, West Hollywood Sheriff Department, Ft. Lauderdale Police Department, the Anchorage Police Department, Dunn, NC Police Department, and associated entities and individuals, public and private and am concerned with retaliation and targeted entrapment from the F.P.D. due to events that I am not at liberty to currently state. The most atrocious occurring on February 4, 2009 at Cross Creek Mall with Officer Hererra who was insolent, unprofessional, intimidating, and threatening with the African-American security guard of Cross Creek Creek Mall and there were many eyewitnesses. First, let’s chronologically, briefly address this past week, notwithstanding the incident in 2007. 1. On February 3, @ 8:20 p.m. E.S.T., I called 9/11 due to a large African American male threatening me with violence and F.P.D. Officers Black and Armstrong responded. Officer Black was very churlish and discourteous by treating me, the victim, like the aggressor by asking me why I was walking the streets of Fayetteville all day rather than taking the report and apprehending the aggressor who was standing a few yards away. I responded to him that I am unemployed, looking for work, had my resumes, have epilepsy and do not drive and was quite bewildered on why that would be an issue. I described the aggressor as a large black male with a fluffy black jacket. Officer Black was ill-mannered and kept repeating that I need a better description although I kept pointing to the man who was less than 20 yards away. Thus, I called 9/11 again and spoke with the Watch Commander and the 2 responding officers departed without stating anything. 2. On February 3 @ 12:29 p.m., E.S.T., I was stopped by F.P.D. Officer Chavez on Mcpherson Church Road/Collinwood (after the officer spoke with a male in a black S.U.V.) while seeking employment. 3. On February 4, 2009 @ 2:14 p.m., E.S.T., I was stopped by Officer Combs on Mcpherson Church Road (near the Olive Garden) while seeking employment. 4. On February 4 @ 3:30 p.m., E.S.T., I walked from the Olive Garden on Sycamore Dairy Road to Cross Creek Mall. I was only in for a few minutes and upon exiting, a women intentional knocked into me and I was verbally and physically harassed by the on-lookers referring to me with obscenities. I walked past them to the other entrance to make a report to security. As I entered, I walked by Officer Hererra who initially walked past me saying nothing. I stated that he “must stop having the public harass me” and he turned around and stopped and searched me. Then, the African-American Security Chief at Cross Creek Mall who has always given me a bad time joined in harassing me and claimed that people claimed that I yelled an obscenity (UNTRUE AND THEY PROVIDED NO EYEWITNESSES TO COLLOBORATE THEIR CLAIM AND NO WRITTEN DOCUMENT AND/OR AFFADAVIT). Then, Officer Hererra asked me to grab my property and go to the security room. As I was doing this, he screamed at me and threatened me, handling his gun. NOTE: II TOLD HIM THAT I HAVE EPILPSY. I ALSO HAVE AIDS AND ARC (AIDS RELATED COMPLICATIONS) THAT INCLUDE DISABLING PERIPHERAL-NEUROPATHY THAT AFFECTS THE HANDS AND FEET EXTREMITIES, AND IN SEVERE CASES LIKE MINE, IT AFFECTS THE ARMS, LEGS AND WALKING IN ADDITION TO SEVERE ARTHRITIS SINCE CHILDHOOD AND DIFFICULTY WITH UNCONTROLLED BOWELL MOVEMENTS DUE TO THESE ILLNESSES AS DESCRIBED BELOW. THESE ARE DOCUMENTED, MOST RECENTLY ON THE 26TH OF JANUARY 2009 WITH DR. CHIMA AT SOUTHER REGIONAL A.H.E.C., AND I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE ANY OF THESE MEDICATIONS EXCEPT FOR EPILEPSY. 5. On the way to the inside the Cross Creek Mall Security, there were many eyewitnesses, mostly military personnel, who witnessed the harassment of Officer Hererra threatening me to walk faster and ready to assault me. Inside the Security Room, the African-American Security Chief slammed the door on my right shoulder while Officer Hererra was standing right behind me so close that I could feel his breathing on my neck. The African-American security guard banned me for one year after I refused to sign his deceitful and duplicitous document that left the omissions of how everything started with no due process to challenge any of the lies and specifically mentioned that if I went to the Bank of America, that I would be arrested. Subsequently, I called 9/11 again to speak with on of the 2 Watch Commanders, so I was transferred to the Cross Creek one who came on duty @ 3:00 p.m., E.S.T., Lieutenant Kelly who incredulously stated to me to “go see a doctor “ and hung up the phone on me. I called again and he repeated the same infantile comments. Later, at 5:00 p.m., E.S.T., I called for an apology and he denied speaking to me or even knowing about the Cross Creek Mall incident even though he was the on-duty (although he is unfit for duty) Watch Commander for this specific location. Then, the African-American security chief, numerous other security guards with hands on and near their weapons, along with Officer Hererra, walked me all the way to Skibo Road, even following in vehicles that seemed quite excessive with numerous outside eyewitnesses as I did not disobey, I repeat, I did not disobey any order other than telling them that attempting to force me to sign a document, especially one filled with falsehoods, is illegal and this angered them. 6. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/peripheral-neuropathy • Peripheral neuropathy, in its most common form, causes pain and numbness in your hands and feet. The pain typically is described as tingling or burning, while the loss of sensation often is compared to the feeling of wearing a thin stocking or glove. • Peripheral neuropathy can result from such problems as traumatic injuries, infections, metabolic problems and exposure to toxins. One of the most common causes of the disorder is diabetes. • In many cases, peripheral neuropathy symptoms improve with time — especially if it's caused by an underlying condition that can be resolved. Medications initially designed to treat other conditions, such as epilepsy and depression, are often used to reduce the painful symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Symptoms Your nervous system is divided into two broad categories. Your central nervous system consists of your brain and spinal cord. All the other nerves in your body are part of your peripheral nervous system, which includes:  Sensory nerves to receive feelings such as heat, pain or touch  Motor nerves that control how your muscles move  Autonomic nerves that control such automatic functions as blood pressure, heart rate, digestion and bladder function Most commonly, peripheral neuropathy begins in the longest nerves — the ones that reach to your toes. Specific symptoms vary, depending on which types of nerves are affected. Signs and symptoms may include:  Gradual onset of numbness and tingling in your feet or hands, which may spread upwards into your legs and arms  Burning pain  Sharp, jabbing or electric-like pain  Extreme sensitivity to touch, even light touch  Lack of coordination  Muscle weakness or paralysis if motor nerves are affected  Bowel or bladder problems if autonomic nerves are affected  Causes  A number of factors can cause neuropathies. These factors include:  Autoimmune diseases. These include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and Guillain-Barre syndrome.  Other diseases. Kidney disease, liver disease and an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) also can cause peripheral neuropathy. Patients with HIV/AIDS also are prone to develop peripheral neuropathy.  Inherited disorders. Examples include Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and amyloid polyneuropathy. I respectfully request an inquiry into this incident and why anyone who may or may not have complained about me was not mentioned or corrective action to them due to harassing me by calling me “faggot” and pushing me that initiated the whole incident in addition to the rescinding of the 1-year ban as I will forward this letter to the following businesses at Cross Creek Mall. Sincerely, Gerry Lindgren c/o Andersons’ 7896 King Road Fayetteville, NC 28306 910.423.7855

Comment: I live in Rowan County. In 2006, our county commissioners signed a tax incentive agreement with PGT Industries, which appears on your website as having expanded into Rowan County. The continual obligation requires PGT to maintain a specific level of employment in order to remain eligible for the tax incentive. My question is where may I check to verify the current level of employment for PGT in Salisbury? Does the Department of Commerce keep those records? Or the ESC? And is it public record?

Subject: Joyce James & James Fullwood

Comment: There was a story in the N&O today about James Fullwood assigning two parole officers to investigate a plant that was found on the floor of Joyce James office.  This took place in a time when Alamance county had the state's hightes absconder rate.  Two days and two officers were used in this investigation.  Now it seems to me this was an extreme reaction that spent taxpayers money in an area that was totally wasteful and it was a blatant abuse of power.  The secondary part of this story is that Joyce was PROMOTED???!!!!! Who made that decision on someone as unstable as to get hysterical over a plant on her office floor???  Please look into this and at best both of them should be demoted if not fired for wasteful use of our money and it makes me wonder what other bad decisions are being made by these two and how much taxpayers money have they wasted we are not aware of??? Thank you for your time. PS I did not vote for you but so far I am impressed with what you have done. Thank you for that.

Subject: How to rasie money with no protest from taxpayers.

Comment: I know how to raise money for North Carolina with little or no protest. I am from Missouri and Texas. I work with the USMC as a high pressure steam boiler operator. I've worked in several different states. Some states required a license some didn't. If you ask twenty five dollars each year for a license for tradesmen or anyone wanting to apply for a tradesmen job you would get alot of money and employers would pay most of it. Even if employers didn't pay a tradesman would because there is pride in being a licensed trademan and it looks good when your looking for a job. I would pay twenty-five dollars for that certificate and you have to pass a test and saftey is increased because not everyone could just go out and do it. Arkansas and Texas made me have one.

Subject: Song about our great state called "Carolina Blue"

Comment: Congratulations Governor Perdue and best wishes for your term and our state. I wrote and recorded a song called "Carolina Blue" through a grant from the Arts and Science Council here in the Charlotte area. It is a song about coming home to NC and its beauty from the mountains to the outer banks to the state bird and tree. I love our state and would like to share it with you. Hopefully it can be used for the betterment of our state and your enjoyment. With your permission and e-mail address, I can send it as an mp3. Here are the lyrics. Sincerely, Jeff Luckadoo "Carolina Blue" Driving into the sunrise east on I-40 Another mile I'll cross that state line As I climb that mountain, it takes my breath away There's nothing like my Carolina sky See the cows on the hill, rolling down to the mill by the riverside, cross the bridge To a white-wash church standing out in the background of a smokey blue mountain ridge (Chorus) Carolina blue I'm coming home to you Been missing you since I've been gone Carolina blue sweet misty morning dew Coming home to you Carolina blue Watch the red bird fly from a long leaf pine Over cotton fields white as snow To a nest on the edge of a hardwood holler Just like the bird, I'm coming home Repeat Chorus From the Blue Ridge Parkway down tobacco road to the outer banks taste the ocean breeze I need to set my boots in my red-dirt roots This place will always be the heart of me Repeat Chorus

Subject: Stop GSE Adverse Market Fees

Comment: Dear Governor, As your constituent, and a member of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers (NAMB), I am writing to you concerning the recent announcement by Fannie Mae to increase fees for purchasing and securitizing mortgages. The increases, announced in Fannie Mae Announcement 08-38 on December 29, 2008, will undoubtedly force new and higher costs on current and future homebuyers searching for affordable mortgage financing. Imposing these fee increases on consumers during a time when mortgage affordability is needed most fails to protect the consumer and will hinder any efforts made to stimulate the housing market. The existing obstacles hindering housing market stimulation compound the fees charged by the GSEs. These include the GSEs not purchasing bond loans, lack of sufficient first time homebuyer programs, no 100% loans available to well qualified buyers, investor loans that are priced our of reach, and no jumbo loans available with favorable terms (no 30 year fixed rate products). Currently, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (GSEs) charge unnecessary and excessive adverse market fees which fluctuate depending on geographic location in the United States. The GSEs also charge additional risk-based pricing fees, which are freezing the mortgage market and preventing a housing recovery. For example, fees are charged for certain credit scores that traditionally signify a good credit risk. These fees negatively impact small business mortgage professionals and their consumers by increasing the overall costs of most loans. Another barrier created by the GSEs to a housing recovery is higher fees for investor owned properties. The GSEs should be encouraging investor purchases, not punishing them for helping to remove non-performing loans from the balance sheets of banks and lenders. In addition, the GSEs are limiting how many properties they will finance for an investor. Such an arbitrary calculation is not justified and each mortgage should be addressed on its merits. As an experienced mortgage professional, I urge you to seek means for Fannie Mae to rescind this action to ensure that consumers are protected and mortgage affordability is not inhibited further.

Subject: New Technology for automotive with pollution reduction and new jobs in NC

Comment: My name is Raimo Peltoniemi, president of CMT, Huntersville, NC. Two years ago, CMT started R&D program to provide new technology to US forging industry. In total there are over 500 Forging shops in US, operating over 3000 presses. These forging shops produce parts for the US automotive industry. In the process of forging, over 10,000,000 lbs of graphite lubricant is used. Up to  90% of this ends up in pollution to air, water and landfill. EPA has cited several forging shops for this airborne pollution. Our coal was; 1) Reduce pollution by 50%,= in actual use,50% reduction was achieved, further test prove that we can reduce it by 75% 2) Improve quality of parts produced for US car makers, = test and actual use of the system has proved this 3) Improve productivity of the forging shops = actual use has confirmed this 4) Reduce cost of parts for US automotive industry =proven in actual runs We are looking for ways to get financing to introduce this technology to US forging industry. This would; 1) Reduce pollution and improve environment 2) Make US forging shops more competitive and cost effective 3) Make US car makers more competitive and cost effective 4) Create several dozens of jobs in NC. There is a need for 2000 units, each unit costs about $100,000 and requires over 700 man-hours each to produce, all parts and supplies used are American made. We are writing this to find out where to go with this. EPA has given us their support but cannot act, our customer in US is very pleased with our technology but has no money to invest on other units. We invested heavily to this New Proven Technology but now have no customers with money to purchase our technology. We have sold this technology to Russia, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Germany but we are now short of operating capital to hire people to go keep us going and expanding. Please, could you give us some leads as where we could go with this. Yours truly Raimo Peltoniemi President Coating Management Technologies, CMT

Subject: EFCA

Comment: Governor Perdue, I am writing to repectfully ask that you reconsider your position on EFCA. In the past unions served a valuable purpose, helping to form safe, healthy & fair working conditions - as well as the middle class. Today unions are helping to drive companies out of business & businesses off of American soil, partly due to VEBA & legacy costs. Additionally, the secret ballot is a cornerstone of the American voter - it is against the grain of all that is American to have open voting. Pressure by union bosses will cause employees to sign the card and vote for a union. This is NONSENSICAL and NOT FAIR. Thank you for your attention.

Subject: Cape Hatteras National Seashore Access

Comment: 2/7/09 I am in hopes that your will become acquanted with this issue and assist in supporting "historical access"? 2/7/09 To: Island Free Press Island Breeze Ocracoke Obsever I attended and made comments at the most recent Rule Making Committee Meeting (2/3/09). The Committee is in its' final stages of trying to come to a consensus as to making a recommendation to the NPS as to "access" to the Seashore. In my view it is "most important" for those of us who have interest in Ocracoke Island to make themselves aware of the consequences of this "rule making process". I feel the NPS will make a decision in the next several weeks or few months as to "new access rules". It appears their decision very well could be to "restrict access" significantly more than it has been historically. Given that real possibility, the people who have interest in our Island (property owners, business owners and citizens) need to "decision" if they want to be "apart of the decision" by vocalizing their concerns if any or "sit ideally by" while additional restrictions are put in place? I am in hopes that you and will see fit to publish the following ASAP (time is of essence): 1. The documents I have attached (Comments made at the Committee Meeting on 2/3/09 and the Letter to the Editor) 2. The most recent "beach access map proposals" as are on the Dare County Web Site. David Scott Esham gave me the following web address for access but I can to get the maps to come up? www.darenc.com/regneg/maps.pdf It seems he is the most knowledgeable source as to information on the Committee Actions trelative to proposals as to access. 3. Most importantly, a map of what has been the recent "history as to access" on Ocracoke so the "parties of interest" can determine what the additional restrictions are that are being considered and proposed (i.e. be able to make a comparison of what is being given up). The decision by the NPS on access is one that we will have to live with for years to come. It may significantly impact the attraction of the Park to its' "users" and have a profound impact on Ocracoke both from a personal and business stand point! The Press is needs to convey the situation. I am in hopes you will consider the issue as important as I do and give it good and urgent press? A"response" is appreciated? Respectfully, H. Wayne Clark Edwards of Ocracoke Rooms and Cottages Ocracoke Island, North Carolina www.edwardsofocracoke.com www.ocracokeduckcottages.com Date: 2/3/09 To: Cape Hatteras National Seashore Rulemaking Committee From: H. Wayne Clark Edwards of Ocracoke Rooms and Cottages Ideas/Thoughts on the ORV Issue General Good afternoon. My name is Wayne Clark. My family consisting of my son, his wife, my wife and me operate a Family Owned Motel and Cottage Operation on Ocracoke Island; Edwards of Ocracoke. We have eleven motel units, and in addition ten cottages and apartments. Our “reason to be” is to provide comfortable, affordable lodging in the historic village that adjoins the park. We have owned the business since 1996. The Motel was the first motel on the Island having been constructed by Stanley Wahab in the late thirties. Our goal is to offer very functional facilities with an “Old Ocracoke” theme. We have no grandiose ideas. We just want to make a living in an environment and surroundings that we love and enjoy living in. The Park is very much a part of our everyday life and livelihood... Economic Impact Surf Fishing has historically been a tremendous draw for Ocracoke Island. Access to both inlets (Hatteras and Ocracoke) is important to these Fisherman both during day light and night hours. The Shoulder Seasons (spring and fall) provide for excellent fishing and extend our tourist season significantly. These type Park Visitors are very instrumental as to the ability of the local economy to sustain itself. The economy of Ocracoke Village is significantly dependant upon the continuing, historical use attraction of the Park. Surf Fishing and the use of ORVs is an important draw for many Visitors. Without primary consideration for the historical use of the beach relative to surf fishing and ORV use, the livelihoods of the entire Village is at risk. Noting that the local economy has been allowed to grow and become increasingly dependant on Tourism by way of ORV Access and convenient beach access for Surf Fisherman, it is very concerning that significant “changes of use” are being considered; especially given that little off setting or mitigating plans are being considered. The local citizens, businesses and Park Visitors did not contribute to the current regulatory problem. The Ocracoke Citizens have based there livelihood on the only economic engine available (Tourism). To change regulations as to park use that could have a negative impact on the local economy is both reckless and irresponsible unless done with the utmost consideration for “historical uses” and the use of “mitigation” as an offset should additional restrictions be put in place. If regulations need to be changed relative to environmental/endangered species concerns; be it birds, turtles or whatever; changes only need to be considered after making allowances for the historical use of the Park. Significant changes that reduce the historical use particularly in reference to ORVs and Surf Fisherman should be limited to what are “proven needs” by sound facts and not based on speculation. A Community and Way of Life are at risk through “no fault of their own”. It is my view that there could very well be “legal issues” relative to implementing regulations that have a negative impact on Local Businesses, Property Values and Citizens of Ocracoke Island. I have heard of “historical precedents” whereby citizens and/or businesses must be compensated for loss of economic value when restrictions are placed on public use areas that have a “direct, negative, economic impact”. Without some type of mitigation or offset as to “use”, it is my view that this type remuneration needs to be explored be it a suit involving the Park Service or the Organizations that are favoring more restrictions. It is recognized that certain areas of the Island are more environmentally sensitive than others (North and South Points). These areas need “special review” but any “use limitations” (changes) should only be considered after giving much thought to the historical use and providing mitigation relative to the potential impact on the local economy. I ask this question to those of you on the Negotiating and Rule Making Committee and NPS who advocate major changes that could directly cause harm to the local economy by imposing additional restrictions on ORV use and Surf Fishing access; “how would you feel if the means of livelihood for you, your family and community were being threatened? Most all our citizens are very concerned, some to the point of outright hysteria. In my view you should be as understanding and concerned for mankind (our citizens) as you are for the environment and wild life. I am sure you would expect that of us if the “shoe were on the other foot”! Possible Means of Mitigation I do have the following thoughts should it becomes necessary to significantly change the historical use of the Ocean Front relative to ORV use and the availability of “prime surf fishing areas”. With the advent of a new Federal Effort to booster the economy by way of spending funds on Road Projects and related, it makes sense to consider “opening up” the sound side of the Park to ORV use. This could be done by putting in place a Sound Side ORV Trail (running parallel to the sound) complete with beach access and parking areas. The Sound Side Trail could be geared towards recreational use (Wade Fishing, Birding, Swimming, Kite Boarding and Beach Combing). With publicity to make the public aware of this new, sound side recreational opportunity; perhaps it would offset some of the potential economic negatives that could come from additional restrictions as to historical use on the ocean front? Perhaps with a Sound Side ORV Trail the NPS would be opening up sound side access to areas that are less environmentally sensitive than some on the ocean side. This would assist in compensating for the Public’s loss of use relative to environmentally sensitive areas on the ocean front. There appears to be a real need for a Sound Side Beach similar to the Ocean Side Beach Walk Over Access near Ocracoke Village. This would offer an alternative for Park Visitors when the weather conditions (wind) on the Ocean Beach are less than optimal. Currently many stretches of ocean side beach are not open in “peak periods” (summer). Perhaps the NPS could actually open more ocean side beaches in the summer to compensate for areas that must be closed relative to being environmentally sensitive? There definitely needs to be more access areas for Surf Fishing if the ocean side is going to be more restricted. Funding for the Capital Projects (Sound Side ORV Trail, Parking and Beach Access) could come from the Federal Plan for stimulating the economy. Funding to police the additional use of the Park could come from “new user fees”. Environmental Groups and Organizations that are advocating closure as to “historical use” should also assist in funding, possibly advertising. I implore those on the Committee that feel “additional restrictions of use” need to be put in place to at a minimal provide some means to mitigate the “real potential” of economic loss to the Island Citizens and Businesses This can best be accomplished by way of additional access in less environmentally sensitive areas. Thank you for your time and effort! H. Wayne Clark Edwards of Ocracoke Rooms and Cottages Ocracoke Island ORV Use of the Park Negotiating Rule Making Committee Letter to the Editor 2/5/09 I attended one of the Negotiating Rule Making Committee Meeting yesterday 2/4/09. Attached are the “comments I made”. I note due to the four minute time limit much of what is in the attachment was not voiced as to detail (2nd and 3 rd pages). As I understand it there will be only one more meeting. First and foremost we all need to thank David Scott Esham and Gene Balance for representing our interest. The process has been very arduous and time consuming. I suspect it has been most difficult for both of them given the time demands and diverse positions of the stake holders. Most of all, the process appears to have accomplished very little. I imagine they feel their time has been wasted. At the risk of sounding like a “know it all” and “being a Johnnie come lately”; it appears that the process will not produce an agreed upon recommendation to the Park as to use by pedestrians and ORVs. From yesterday’s meeting I gathered that the Environmental Advocates have even digressed further from consensus since the last meeting. It is my expectation that they now realize no consensus will come about, thus they are “staking themselves out” as to being as “restrictive as possible as to beach access” thinking that the NPS will offer up something “in the middle”. With them being “most restrictive”, their thinking is that they will get more of what they want relative to negotiating with the NPS. Given that the “historical use” (prior to the Consent Degree) was not part of the negotiations (not on maps); it is evident that the NPS is leaning towards additional restrictions. In my view this is entirely unfair. In summary, it appears that the time has come to realize that the only recourse the “Open Beach Access Group” has is to “lobby the NPS” as to returning the beaches back as to their historical use. The premise behind the argument being that the citizens, property owners, tourist and businesses that use and rely on the park resources are not responsible for the “regulatory quire mire” the NPS has got itself into and can not agree to changes that will in all probability negatively impact them from a social (personal use) and economic (supports their livelihood) use stand point. Business Owners, just think about how many ORVs are in your parking lot? Citizens that are employed by businesses or provide services (say cleaning, maintenance and entertainment) and products (say seafood, construction) all have a huge interest in how Beach Access is decisioned. The Property Owners who own and/or rent their cottages also have a tremendous stake in that rental income could be less and property values may go down. The potential loss of business that runs our local economic engine in my view is significant. It is my thinking that should the NPS NOT GO BACK to the regulatory structure as to the historical use of the resources (use prior to the Consent Decree); that the users (businesses, citizens, and tourist and property owners) should explore legal action as to mitigation and/or remuneration for loss of use (social and economic loss). The suit if justified should name the Environmental Organizations and the NPS as Defendants. The NPS has always had to deal with the threat of a law suit from the Environmentalist; it is now time for concerned citizens and business owners to use the same legal tool if available. It is time for the Local Stakeholders to recognize the seriousness of what is going on. Our economic and individual rights to use Public Resources are at risk. Finally, the historical method of lobbying through the “politicos” (local, state and federal) is all the resources we have outside the Court/Legal System. Contacting your political representatives is paramount! It is time to answer the call! H. Wayne Clark Edwards of Ocracoke Rooms & Cottages www.edwardsofocracoke.com
