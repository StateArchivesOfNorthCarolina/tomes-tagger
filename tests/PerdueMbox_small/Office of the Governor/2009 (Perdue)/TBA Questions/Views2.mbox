Subject: Medicinal Cannabis in North Carolina

Comment: I sincerely hope you change your mind in regards to the value of medicinal cannabis, as it is intended to provide relief to the sick and dying patients who's doctors have not been able to find adequate pain treatment in other medicines. I personally have a grandmother going through chemotherapy and none of the pain relief medicines she takes are helpful, we want her to try cannabis to treat her chemotherapy side effects but we don't want to break the law, we simply want to effectively alleviate her pain. Medicinal Cannabis is not about giving teenagers legal access to marijuana for recreational purposes, it is an issue of compassion for the sick and dying. Below I have provided countless links verifying the medicinal benefits found in the cannabis plant, and the side effects are nothing quite as dangerous as those we all see in prescription drug commercials.

Comment: Governor Perdue, Rhode Island Governor Carcieri empanelled 20 experts to study the state's tax code and give him recommendations for spurring the state's economy. The panel recommended tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. Gov. Carcieri recently introduced his budget with many tax cuts including elimination of the corporate tax rate and reducing the top marginal income tax rate from 9.9% to 5.5%. This makes alot of sense to me and I urge you to investigate taking a similar approach to help stimulate N.C.'s economy. Thank you for your time. Aaron Clarke

Dear Governor,

Cut the payroll by 10% and you will balance the budget. Your payrolls are by far way to bloated. Private sector has to cut the fat and payrolls. Why does the State of NC think its exempt from being more efficient!? You have WAY too many employees. You do not need all this government waste.

I conservatively estimate that you can save at least $1 Billion, maybe even more, if the state were to start deporting illegal aliens and STOP paying the high costs for their education and medical costs. This is plainly wrong. Taxpayers should NOT be paying the costs for people who are in our country illegally! The cost of allowing them to be educated in Wake county alone has to be in the 100's of millions.

> The Costs of Illegal Immigration to North Carolinians

North Carolina has a rapidly growing illegal alien population of about 385,000 persons, and the fiscal burden on North Carolinians resulting from public services used by that population is similarly increasing. The federal government estimated North Carolinas illegal alien population at 380,000 persons as of 2007. The growth of the illegal alien population since 2000 accounts for all of the total foreign-born population increase over the same period. It also accounts for more than one-sixth (17.7%) of the states total population increase.

> FAIR estimates that the annual fiscal burden on North Carolina taxpayers from illegal immigration is more than $1.3 billion. That equates to an annual cost of about $388 per native-born headed household. In addition, there is a cost to the states economy of another $1.2 billion from remittances sent abroad.
> 
> The rapid growth of the illegal alien population prompted the state legislature to take action to deny drivers licenses to persons without a Social Security number or valid visa as of August 2006. Since then state agencies have had to verify the legal employment status of their new employees. Additionally, seven counties and the Durham police department have entered into Section 287(g) agreements with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that train and deputize local law enforcement personnel to work cooperatively in immigration law enforcement. These measures are a positive response to public opinion in the state. A Rassmussen/FOX poll of North Carolina voters found in 2007 that more than seven out of ten respondents agreed that it is very important to for the government to improve border enforcement and reduce illegal immigration. An earlier Elon University poll found that 56 percent responded that immigrants are a burden on the state because of the jobs, housing and health care they take. To the extent that these enforcement measures encourage illegal aliens to leave the state, they should help Governor Perdue cope with an anticipated one to three billion dollar budget deficit.

Fitzsimon File

Redefining the tough choices

by <mailto:chris@ncpolicywatch.com>Chris Fitzsimon

Governor Beverly Perdue will release her budget proposal Tuesday and there's little doubt that her response to the state's $4 billion budget shortfall will include deep cuts to most state agencies. Scenarios being considered include 15 percent reductions in most departments, 9 percent in higher education and human services and 7.5 percent in public schools.

Reportedly, Perdue also plans to propose increases in taxes on tobacco and alcohol, but will stay away from closing major corporate tax loopholes and any broad-based tax package that asks every segment of North Carolina to help balance the state's budget.

The folks on the Right are giddily awaiting Perdue's spending plan and the cuts it will include to the government they despise. Their only disappointment is that the money from the federal stimulus package may allow some state programs to survive, though with far less public investment.

The think-tanks are still cranking out columns and reports demanding no tax increases and claiming that state spending is the problem, while urging lawmakers to end basic services to the aged, blind and disabled and abolish programs that help at-risk children and single mothers.

Senate Minority Leader Phil Berger shares that view and says most people in North Carolina won't notice the budget cuts, one of the more absurd statements made in a building where there's never been a shortage of absurd statements.

State employees will pay more for health care, families will pay more to send their kids to college, and people with a disability or mental illness will lose services and will end up on a waiting list if they are lucky.

There will be less affordable housing at a time when more people need it, less health care available when more people can't afford it, and less help for basic community services at a time when nonprofits can't provide it.

House Speaker Joe Hackney says he knows the cuts will affect every citizen in the state, but there doesn't seem to be much political appetite to do much about it. In many ways, Perdue and the Democratic leadership in the General Assembly have become enablers of the stories and headlines that are likely in response to Perdue's budget proposal.

If she does propose higher taxes on cigarettes or beer, that's sure to lead most reports followed by praise from lawmakers and many pundits for her cuts, her fiscal responsibility and "making the tough choices."

But sending nonviolent offenders to prison instead of treatment isn't a tough choice or the right one. Neither is reducing investments that help the elderly stay in their homes and out of institutions or denying help to a mother taking care of a severely disabled child.

Those are the easy choices, made because a pollster says voters may not support a candidate who raises taxes. Polls about taxes are not always indicators that people are opposed to paying a little more to keep the state's safety net intact and the teachers of their children in the classroom.

The polls often show instead that policymakers haven't worked hard enough to explain the choices, what's really at stake addressing a $4 billion shortfall and whose wellbeing is on the line.

There's still time for lawmakers to make that case, to tell the story of the people behind the numbers, the people who stand to feel the cuts everyday, regardless of what Senator Berger thinks.

For those who are interested in making the tough, but right choices, the first step is to remember that the numbers from the extreme government slashers that often define the public budget debate are simply wrong.

North Carolina does not have a spending problem. The state spends less per capita now than it did nine years ago. The state does not have an unfriendly business climate either. An Ernst & Young study released last month found that businesses in North Carolina pay lower taxes as a percentage of Gross State Product than businesses in any other state in the country.

The study from the conservative Tax Foundation that says otherwise is based on arbitrary assumptions and ignores the role that public investment in education and infrastructure plays, which helps explain why surveys of corporate executives always rank North Carolina as one of the best places to do business.

It makes sense to join roughly half the other states and close a tax loophole that allows multistate corporations to avoid paying the North Carolina tax they owe. That would end the unfair treatment of North Carolina companies and bring in $100 million a year.

There are plenty of other progressive ways to raise revenue, but first policymakers must reject the soundbites of the anti-progress crowd and decide they want to balance the budget fairly without making life worse for people already struggling.

Maybe Perdue will surprise us. Maybe lawmakers will see polls as evidence of minds they need to change instead of opinions they need to fear.

Maybe somebody will step up and make the tough, but right choices for North Carolina.

Governor Bev,
There is a way to save big bucks and it's huge.
Cut out the athletic departments in the university level and encourage intermural activity by people at any age - kind of like Germany.
How much money would that free up for education.
Otherwise it's madness.

Gov. Perdue,
 Why don't you start cutting your pay and the officials pay before you start cutting back on schools ,etc?
Schools in NC aren't up to par in NC as it is. Didn't see anything in article in Winston/Salem Journal that says you are even considering cutting the pays of Gov..
 What about my letter on Annexation that I sent weeks ago. I haven't had any response on that either.
Everyone tells me I won't hear personally from you. I don't want a form letter return.

Subject: Raising taxes???

Comment: I cannot believe with the economy in such dire straits already that you are considering raising taxes! There is no revenue because people don't have money to spend as it is and you want to take more of it from us??? I hope you enjoy your term as Governor because you won't get a second one. I can't believe anyone would vote you in again, I certainly won't vote for you.

Comment: please consider the families in north carolina that are hurting. even though my family is not on public assistance, we did lose half our income and half our net worth in 2008. many others have it worse. all i ask is that government suffer with us instead of increasing our suffering.

Subject: No New Ideas

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, Why in the world are you trying to kill another industry in our state when we are already stuggling with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country? The Federal Government has already given us a stomach punch this year and now you want to offer up the the death blow. Is it better to tax an industry out of business or continue to collect the taxes of thousands of employed people that support that industry? Why not strech the windfall of stimulus money that's coming from Washington? We are all scraping to make ends meet and we expect the same from Raliegh. Please don't put thousands more in line for unemployment checks instead of paychecks. Sincerely, Cindy Adams, Winston-Salem

Subject: Budget

Comment: Here's a thought instead of cutting jobs & services why not cut the pay of you all, the governor, house & senate? You are all millionaries any way why all the free perks; vehicles, flights when armed forces Members travel they use their own vehicles,to and from work why can't you or even use public transportation I think the governing body needs to cut out all the free perks it would cut the budget by millions!!!!!!!!!!!!

I am writing to express my opinion of the shocking news I received today. I was informed that the UNC in Washington Program had been cancelled indefinitely. I am a student that was chosen to participate this summer from UNC Charlotte. I find this news incomprehensible due to the current situation of our country. I cannot understand how the UNC system could keep a finance major out of Washington at such a pivotal point in the United States economy. We are in the midst of the greatest economic downturn since the great depression. Hands on experience is one of the best ways to learn. The UNC system mission statement states, ...That mission is to discover, create, transmit, and apply knowledge to address the needs of individuals and society. This mission is accomplished through instruction, which communicates the knowledge and values and imparts the skills necessary for individuals to lead responsible, productive, and personally satisfying lives; through research, scholarship, and creative activities, which advance knowledge and enhance the educational process; and through public service, which contributes to the solution of societal problems and enriches the quality of life in the State. In the fulfillment of this mission, the University shall seek an efficient use of available resources to ensure the highest quality in its service to the citizens of the State.... I believe these words say it all. If this is the systems true mission the abrupt end to the UNC in Washington program is a sham. I also cannot comprehend how the system could accept people into a program and then deny them the opportunity after their commitment. I have personally turned down internships knowing that I could not possibly fulfill them due to me spending the summer in Washington. The system has not only put me in a hard place through their erroneous decisions, but has left me with few options for summer internship prospects. The participants in this program are the leaders of tomorrow. The best is yet to come. I firmly believe that someday you will look back and shake your head in disbelief that you canceled such a valuable program.

Sincerely,

Robert S. Powell
