Governor Perdue,

Congratulations on your election!  I am an Independent; however, for the first time in my life, I voted a straight ticket - Democratic.

I am concerned about your recent statement about redecorating the Governor's office.  In a time when our state is in grave financial straights, I strongly urge you not to spend money on such a frivilous pursuit.  Even if donors provide the money, that gives the impression that you will owe that industry or people favors in the future - not exactly the ethical message I'm sure you want to convey.

Another reason this is not a good idea is that it will be perceived as a "FEMALE" thing.  As a female who held high-level positions within the federal government until my recent retirement, I am dismayed that, in this day, a female executive should even comment about the appearance of her office.  I have worked in whatever office the man who held the job before me did. 

My advice to you is "suck it up, girlfriend" and put those funds where they are truly needed in our beloved North Carolina.

Good luck.

A native-born Tar Heel who is proud and glad to be back home, 

(Ms) Dale Smith

Pinehurst, NC

Subject: the state deficit

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: First, congratulations on getting elected. Our state is facing a long list of problems, most notably, the budget shortfall. Q: what plans do you have to reduce this without placing extra burdens on taxpayers? Q: have you considered the possibility of legalizing, regulating and taxing the number one cash crop in our state (country)? Yes, I am referring to marijuana. The underground economy, based upon marijuana, is booming - yet generates ZERO tax revenue for our state. Why not legalize, regulate and most importantly TAX it? Where could it be sold? Simple, in our ABC stores. If adults are able to ingest alcohol (a substance which if consumed in too great a quantity will result in death), then adults should be able to consume marijuana (there have been no reported cases of fatalities from using cannabis). The state of Massachusetts recently decriminalized possession of small amounts of cannabis, however this will only serve to fuel the underground economy even more. While Massachusetts will now undoubtedly spend less taxpayer money from year to year due to less marijuana related arrests - what they have done is only try to solve "half the problem". The "other half" is to capture the economic benefit via taxation of a legal product. Dealers don't mind decriminalization, it will mean more business for them - but they truly fear legalization / sale via ABC stores, etc. Why? because they would LOSE all of their customers. Net: please seriously consider the legalization, regulation and taxation of marijuana. The demand will never go away, but as Governor, you could utilize the supply to the state's economic advantage. Treating it in a manner similar to alcohol would send a message to the children that it is a substance only meant for adults. Thank you for taking the time to read this. For your information, I currently do not use cannabis. I am writing this to you in the hopes that government can finally think outside the box in an attempt to solve our state's problems. Sincerely, James T. Halka 704-488-0910

Subject: Early Childhood Education

Comment: First I would like to say CONGRATS! I voted for you and I am so pleased and overwhelmed by this history making moment for our great stae of NC! I am an early childhood professional and I have sent in a comment before on the issue. I am glad that you are a supporter of early childhood education and I just wanted to know if you will continue the Child Care Wages project? It has been a blessing to me and those of us who care for tomorrow's leaders. I would like to see the program continue. As you may already know the salary for those of us who lay the foundation for all educational experiences (Child Care to College) make very little compared to other professions. My husband is a truck driver, he doesn't have a college degree, however he makes more money than I do and I do have a college degree.It is my hope that you will personally respond to my email although if you do not I understand, but I would at the very least like an answer to my question. Again, CONGRATS!

Subject: Children's Rights

Comment: Dear Governor, What is North Carolina's position on protecting children's rights in custody proceedings? In other words, if a North Carolina child runs the risk of being deported as a result of a questionable judicial decision, is there an existing law that protects that child from a decision that could wreck that child's future? How can I, as a citizen, help protect a child's rights without having to spend a fortune in legal fees? Shouldn't each child have a right to a legal guardian when inalienable rights are in jeopardy of being violated? Our granddaughter suffered such a fate with no one in court to defend her rights against a questionable decision by Guilford County District Court. Our family thought highly of the US judicial system until experience showed us that injustice has become a globalized affair, even in Greensboro. The UCCJEA which Judges Enochs and Turner used to justify the deportation of our granddaughter is an act with an unfair edge favoring foreign litigants to the detriment of American respondents. The act could have been applied differently in the child's interest and favor, but it wasn't. This act made it possible for a biological deadbeat Frenchman dad to unjustly deprive a child of her mother, the happy four years of life lived in Greensboro with extended family and friends, and condemned her to an all French language school in Milan, Italy with no English speaking classmates or friends and a Spanish speaking great-aunt as her caretaker replacing her loving and caring and working single mom. This is how Guilford County District Court administered justice on September 26, 2008 with Judge Turner's oral enforcement of an Italian decree. A decision Stayed by the Appeals Court in Raleigh but too late to save our granddaughter from her dire destiny as she was spirited away from US jurisdiction in subterfuge abroad to Paris, France. Our granddaughter, who is a naturalized American is a case of justice gone wrong because international laws for the protection of children were ignored by a North Carolina court. Our aim as grandparents is to seek justice in our granddaughter's interest and that of all defenseless children victims of judicial carelessness. For the records, the grandmother is American raised and schooled in New York and Massachusetts while the grandfather is Italian. The Judicial Standards Commission has been contacted regarding the above, but we feel that as First Grandmother, the subject matter would be of concern to your office as the new Governor. Sincerely, Lydia and Adriano Manca Grandparents Ph: 336 617 8798

Hey Bev,



Congratulations on your victory and your first day in office!

I know you are getting a number of calls and emails so I want to thank you in advance for reading this but I have no expectation for you to reply. J



I don’t know who to write to about this so you came to mind J.



I was wondering how we could get back the old “write off the interest on car loans?”

I was about 12yrs old at the time the government took it back.



The US Gov’t could reinstate this old tax law but make solely for American made cars.



This would boost the sales of GM, Chrysler, and Ford as well as give a financial incentive for the public to purchase.



I hope this helps,

I appreciate your public service Bev,

Thank you,



Chris

Subject: Stars and Stripes U.S. Young Adult Council

Comment: Dear Mrs. Governor, Good day. Our names are Kathryn and Katie. We are writing to you as concerned and determined United States citizens. We are aware that everyone is equal under God and the law, as stated by the United States Declaration of Independence, but we both strongly believe that young adults (people between the ages of 10 and 17) do not participate in political affairs as much as is desirable. We understand that children/young adults are recognized and limited fairly by the laws. It is also understandable that many United States children do not recognize political concepts, as well as other concepts, as well as adults. However, we feel that we understand a lot. We know that we are capable of learning more, just as other politically interested young adults are. We both have dreams/goals of becoming very politically involved in the US government of this blessed country. We are ready to strive for accomplishment of these goals at a young age, for we hold the future in our hands. We would appreciate it if you would help us to make the very best of this opportunity, for young adults, for our country, and for helping the world become a better place! We are proposing the following idea to you in hopes that you, as our stateâ€™s governor, will consider it and perhaps allow us to begin making a difference in this country, as young adults, the holders of the future! In each state of this country, we dream that there could be a cluster of ten to twenty (depending on the stateâ€™s population) privileged young adults who could meet possibly in the Governorâ€™s Mansion once a monthâ€”or somewhere else, if needed or preferred. This council would be called the Stars & Stripes U.S. Young Adult Council. Each state meeting would be a gathering of young adults representing their state, who would talk about ways to make the country and their state a safer, happier, and generally better place to live. Young adults would be accepted into Stars & Stripes by writing a detailed persuasive essay explaining why they would like to be involved in their stateâ€™s council. The founders and/or the governor would decide which essays were most convincing and well written, and then the top essay contestants would be accepted into the council. Each young adult would create a project displaying one particular problem of the state or country and ways to help solve the problem. If the idea is recognized, the project and the creator will have the opportunity to travel to Washington, D.C. to present their project in the Lincoln Memorial to the other state representatives from the Stars & Stripes US Young Adult Council. No more than five representatives should be sent from each state. We are aware that this idea would take a lot of effort on both your and our parts, but we are willing to undertake this challenge since it will benefit our country, and we hope that you are too. We are not writing to you as mere little children, but as determined, confident, and strong-willed young adults who are going to help this country, and, farther, this world in making a better place to live. We would deeply appreciate it if you would lend us some of your time so we can all work on our Stars & Stripes US Young Adult Council as a team and as a country. In closing, we hope that you will consider our proposal/request seriously, and will not under-take this thinking that we will not follow through all the way to the end, because we will. We are doing this for our country, not for our pleasure or your inconvenience, but to make changing the world more enjoyable! Have a nice day, and thank you for your time. Please reply as soon as possible to give us your feedback! Best regards, Kathryn A. Buckner Katherine (Katie) E. Shy (Hopefully) Founders of the Stars & Stripes US Young Adult Council

Subject: Teen Dating Abuse Awareness Week

Comment: I am a high school English teacher in Durham and I would like to know if the state of North Carolina will be involved in Teen Dating Abuse Awareness Week, which is February 4-8 this year, in any way. Our students will be participating in this week as a community service project, in order to raise dating abuse awareness at Northern High School. I looked on the state websites, including the Domestic Violence site and the Women's Council, and I could not find a reference to it. Our students' interest in this subject stems from the murder of one of our students, Skye Lee, last year. Her estranged boyfriend killed her in front of her child. The National Criminal Justice Reference Service, http://www.ncjrs.gov/teendatingviolence/publications.html and the American Bar Association, http://www.abanet.org/publiced/teendating.shtml have information on their sites about this week. Many states have programs or campaigns in place to raise awareness about this growing problem. Below is an excerpt from the ABA website: Every year since 2006, United States Senator Mike Crapo (Idaho) has led unanimous, bi-partisan support among Congress members in the House and Senate to designate the first week of February "National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Week" in an effort to bring more public awareness to a problem confronting today's teens. Senate co-sponsors have included Senators Joseph Biden, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Joe Lieberman, Robert Menendez, Patty Murray and Lisa Murkowski. (NOTE: For specific information about Senator Crapo and this initiative, visit his website ) I would be interested in hearing the new Governor's stance on this issue. Thank you.

Comment: Regarding the Homebuilders want incentives to aid more buyers article in the news. Will the govenor go to Washington and try to help bail out the unemployed workers that have been laid off? They have home mortgages, insurance bills and numerous other bills that can't be paid. The home builders are just another worker who has been laid off due to the economy. I feel bad for them as well as everyone else that has lost their jobs. When i get laid off; are you going to bail me and my family out? I am scared to death.

Subject: [Aid4Mail Trial tag #18609] Meeting Today with Senator Hagan

Good morning Governor Perdue,
,
I read in a news article that Senator Hagan is meeting with you today.
I am writing to respectfully ask that you will discuss the OLF
situation in Gates County, NC. The people here have been struggling to
oppose the OLF since September, 2007. We had promises from Senator
Dole that she would oppose the OLF and do everything in her power to
help the citizens of Gates County oppose the OLF, and stop it from
destroying our county and so many peoples lives. We know we do not
know all the deals that were made and discussed with the Navy by
Governor Easley or Dole and Burr. We have shown broad opposition since
we found out we were on the list for a possible siting of the OLF. We
have proof that we were on the list way back in 2003, and were taken
off because of environmental reasons and other factors, and nothing
has changed to warrant putting us back on the list in 2007.

The citizens of Gates County have not had an opportunity to meet with
you or Senator Hagan to discuss your positions on this matter. We are
begging that you discuss this situation, and offer the citizens here
some support and publicly address your position. The people of
Washington County fought the OLF for 7-8 long years, and only had the
support of Governor Easley and Senator Dole near the end of their
struggle. We are asking you and Senator Hagan, Senator Burr and
Congressman Butterfield to join forces and support the people of Gates
County in their opposition to an OLF being sited here. We have no idea
what your current position is, and how you will help us stop the OLF
from being sited in NE NC.

I know you have many important issues to discuss, stimulus package,
economy, etc. but this OLF situation is on the top of the list to
hundreds of people in Gates and Camden counties. We need your help and
support, now is the time to show the citizens how sincere you are in
protecting and serving the citizens of North Carolina.

Our citizens group has been requesting a meeting and have not gotten a
response as to when we may be given a meeting time. We know you are
extremely busy in these first few weeks in office, but we feel it is
imperative to us, as the OLF will negatively impact our futures in
every way. It would mean loss of homes, jobs, inheritance, loss of
farm lands, timberlands, adverse effects on wildlife and state parks,
pollution to our rivers, pollution to our lands, pollution to our
health, loss of wetlands and the list goes on and on.

I am respectfully asking that the topic of the OLF be discussed today,
and you assign someone on your staff to convey that discussion to the
citizens of Gates County, and hopefully keep us informed of any
contact or discussions that may take place now or in the future
concerning the OLF in NE NC.

Thank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter concerning
the OLF in this demanding time period of office.

Sincerely,

Elaine B Herring

Subject: Jobs for 50+ Adults

Comment: Jan. 16, 2008 Dear Governor Perdue: I would like to know where you stand on finding jobs for seniors who are close to retirement? I hope this is a priority for you. I have lived in North Carolina since last December, and I am having an extremely difficult time finding work. For example, I have applied 11 times to Forsyth County for jobs and have never even gotten an interview, although I have many years of experience in office work. Did I mention that I am also paying Cobra $413 a month for healthcare coverage, over and above all my other living expenses? As I sit here, looking at my dwindling savings account, I wonder if I will be able to keep my house, the first one I've ever had. I am in despair about this, as I moved to North Carolina with the hope that it would be a better place to retire than Washington state. (My daughter assured me that the cost of living was cheaper and that jobs were readily available.) Unfortunately, she was wrong. At this point, I think I will only be able to continue on financially for another 3-4 months. After that, I don't know what I will do. Please let me know what your plans are for helping those of us who have dropped through the cracks. I don't want to regret my decision to move here. Thank you for any help and/or encouragement you can offer. Sincerely, Linda Shapero Joylinderella@yahoo.com

Comment: Governor Perdue, While I agree that a stimulus package for citizens, not corporations, is a good idea, I feel like nobody in government has addressed the fact that fuel prices have dropped faster than they went up. The fuel price increase was a major factor in the economic slowdown. What are you planning on doing to ensure this doesn't happen again? I don't subscribe to a supply and demand answer so please don't give me one.

Governor Perdue



These e-mails go unanswered by your Legislative body in Raleigh.  Septic Tanks in Davidson County are not failing.  Our representative does nothing to correspond in any way with his district. The transparency that you and the Democrats tout is not there.  The commission studying this issue of annexation must be blind. No one has been in our area testing septic tanks. If there is evidence that this annexation is being done for all the wrong reasons how can this be ignored?  We all agree in the area of annexation that we are being railroaded only for the money.  We do not need City services.  It is a LIE if they say so.



As governor what are you going to do? You should look into what Representatives are indebted to others for passing whatever.  I have seen some questionable going on with these Rep.

TAX TAX TAX How much more do you think families can bear? Are they wanting to put everyone out of their homes? How much sweat and work are all these folks going to have to do to resolve this issue and how many years?



Best Regards

I second the below. I have a copy of mayor Walser’s letter if you are interested in seeing for yourself how the city of Lexington council is lying about us to push this annexation through. You sent a letter around stating that you are against forced annexation just before the election. Now you can prove it by joining the rest of Davidson County’s “delegation” in presenting a Local Bill to stop this transparent and unethical tax grab. You, sir, are the only one who refuses to try and get a bill passed protecting us. I have a ton of evidence to prove that this annexation is being done for all of the wrong reasons, and if you do not know that it is, please study the law and original intent of the statutes and original study commission statements. You will see that Lexington is far from the original intent of the statutes for annexation. Maybe you would like to see the inter-city email wherein John Gray calls you and Bingham their “sugar daddies”. I know the rest of Davidson County would be interested in knowing why they call you that…….Keith Bost

Governor Perdue



Our Legislatures  don’t read or look at their e-mails. There is a ton of people against forced annexation.  People are coming to Raleigh to protest and many more back home that cannot come but support the cause against forced annexation.



We hope that you follow through with your town meetings to discuss this problem in North Carolina.  North Carolina has a big black mark on it as we are one of four in the nation with this problem still on the books.  Hard to believe we are still that backward a state. 



Do you think businesses want to locate in a state with this unfair practice.



We are waiting on your response and active role to resolve this, this year.  Not many more years in the future.  If that is so we need to remove all in office a place people who are capable of resolving.

My husband never received a response below from this Representative.  Our Rep’s are being lobbied with trips , meals, and whatever to pull this off.  It is a disgrace.



Thank  you for your time.

I understand that you are one of roadblocks for a  Moratorium on forced annexation. There is nothing ethical in allowing cities to determine whether I live in their limits or not. In the case of Lexington , NC nothing from the city has been involved or responsible for the success of our community. There is nothing that the City of Lexington can bring to the Sapona Community that will improve it. Our community and golf facility has been built due to the hard work and funding from the residents and membership. This is simply nothing more than a “Payday” for the City of Lexington. If I would have had any desire to reside within the City Limits I would have done so when I built my  home in 1985. The idea of a city council imposing unwanted services and TAXES is not the principles our Fore-Fathers fought and died for.

According to President Obama and Governor Perdue ‘s people’s advocate stance , the action of FORCED ANNEXTION  should be abolished in this state.  Seems to me forced annexation is Un American.

Subject: ChildSupport/Education

Comment: Dear: Governor Perdue I have several questions for your department what are you going to do about enforcing child support in this state? How are you going to ensure that parents that work with local agencies, make their monthly payments on time and get these payments to child support office in a time manner. Where the problem comes in you have local school systems sending in payments on differnet time schedules, this is not acceptable especially when its a state agencies. All state agencies should have a certain date to make all monthly payments to child support. This should come has a standard deduction from the employee payroll each month. All, goes back to procedures and rountines within the state agencies. Second, what is your department going to do about the education for special needs students. You can not have the same curriculum for special needs students, like you have regular students. Again, I vote you and my expectations for you are set high. I would like a personal response from you about these issues, because North Carolina needs to do alot of changing in the area of child support and education. Best wishes, to you and your staff.

Subject: Strategies for economic reversal

Comment: I was considering saving up money to purchase land and have a rammed earth â€“ solar adobe â€“ stone - tabby/tapia â€“ roman and Hawaiian volcanic ash concrete and recycled concrete walled and floored, straw bale and other natural material insulated, steel and recycled rail road ties framed â€“ beamed home) Oregon Yurtworks, LLC modest diameter yurt house that is connected to a converted shipping container built in North Carolina. While I am a SSDI recipient and will most likely never be able to actualize this dream and goal, in looking at the economic, occupational, educational and health care status of North Carolina, I would have to be a complete fool to remain in this State past December 2009. And I am not foolish. However, what initiatives are being considered and explored to determine whether the old factory buildings in this State could be converted to sites in which companies that produce Solar glass, or green home building materials, or produces residential windmills, or builds furniture and homes that cater to the aging â€œbaby boomerâ€ population (many of whom will undoubtedly need wheelchair accessible, AFFORDABLE, and elevator equipped homes), businesses that manufacture outdoor whole house wood furnaces and a magnet for African American/Native American/Latino American/Asian American fashion designers (in other words become the Paris, Milan, Tokyo, NYC of the South)? There are so many for sale signs in this region, it is disheartening. But I suspect that if your corporation council signaled a CHANGE in this direction, the businesses will follow.

Subject: involuntary annexation

Comment: Governor Purdue: My property was annexed, despite unanimous neighborhood protest,by the city of Carrboro, even though I have a Chapel Hill address. The only service I receive from being a resident of the town of Carrboro is free garbage collection, which was costing me ~$18.00/month privately. Apparent to me is the fact that NC is taxing their residents to death, without any evidence in cutbacks on their part, in contrast to some states that have no state income tax at all. I am aware of a bill before the house that would prohibit involuntary annexation. I'm wondering if that bill is partially due to the situation in Carrboro. Your thoughts & assistance would much be appreciated. Sincerely, JP

Subject: CPSIA

Comment: I am writing in regards to the CPSIA to take in effect on Feb 10th. This new law is written so broadly that EVERY item meant for children under 12 yrs old MUST be tested for lead independently. I am a stay at home mother of 4 young children and military wife who makes hand sewn children's clothing out of cotton fabric and cotton thread to sell on ebay to help contribute to my family's income. I cannot afford thousands of dollars spent on lead testing for each outfit I make. The cost would far exceed any profit and the testing would destroy the garment. This new law will put SO MANY small businesses like mine OUT OF BUSINESS. There are many crafters on ebay and etsy that will no longer be able to make handmade items for children. It is not fair to have a blanket legislation including items that DO NOT have a high lead content. This law should list the items that need to be tested that are known to have lead content..rather than items such as cotton fabric that is not known to have lead..yet I am still required to test each and every outfit I make for lead under this new law. It is ridiculous how far reaching a ripple effect this new law will have and will completely wipe so many out of business. Something needs to be done. Thrift Stores and such have been exempt..home crafters need that exemption as well. Please do all you can to help. This new law was not well thought out or well written..and many will have to suffer because of that. I am all for protecting our children from lead..but this law is targeting the WRONG items and the WRONG people. Something desperately needs to be done. Thanks, Tina Frazier

Subject: mental health crisis

Comment: I am remorseful and angry about the lack of funding for mental health. It is a devastating crisis that has left mental health patients without hope. In return, lack of treatment facilities and lack of funding for staff has guaranteed these patients and their families, a destiny full of anguish. Society will also see the repercussions. How could this happen and what will you do to help these people so desperately in need? I am ashamed of this debacle we call government.

Subject: New River Stream Gauge

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am writing today asking for your assistance in saving the New River Stream Gauge located near Gum Branch Road (USGS Station Number 02093000) in Onslow County. This stream gauge has been collecting important environmental data for almost 50 years now. Sadly, the gauge is threatened with decommissioning if funding is not secured by February 13, 2009. The gauge offers real-time stream flow data that is important for protecting public safety on our waters. With the establishment of paddle trails and the most welcome surge in local folks getting out and paddling on the New River, the availability of accurate and timely data to judge whether there is sufficient (or too much) water for paddling is critical. Our public waters are a huge draw for tourism as well as an integral part of our local heritage. Losing our stream gauge will severely impact these activities. Elmer Eddy of The Stewards of the White Oak River Basin says, â€œWe do not plan a paddle trip to clean up trash and litter in Onslow County without first checking this gauge. It is the only gauge in Onslow County that lets us know whether we can or cannot paddle the upper reaches of all our rivers in Onslow County. We use it constantly. Our good work will be hampered without it.â€ Scientists working to protect our public trust waters also find the data collected by the gauge invaluable. Dr. Michael Mallin of UNCW writes, â€œThe availability of the stream gauge for the New River has proven to be of great value in scientific studies of that system. Using the data from the gauge, we were able to statistically correlate river flow with nitrogen loading to the New River Estuary, indicating that the majority of the nutrient load no longer comes from the Jacksonville or USMC sewage treatment plants, but rather from the agricultural and developed areas upstream, coming in from non-point source runoff. The gauge will be of great use in any hydrological or pollutant modeling efforts for this system, and is certainly of key value in determining how drought or high river discharge periods impacts the algal bloom problems that periodically impact the estuary. Such devices are well worth the cost of upkeep and it is critical scientifically to keep it functioning!â€ Stephanie Garrett of NC Department of Environment and Natural Resources adds, â€œI use the stream height and flow data when evaluating our water quality data at my monitoring station located at the bridge where the gauge is. The gauge data has also been extrapolated for downstream sampling data as well. I sample there monthly and being able to look at both weather (rainfall) data and stream flow is extremely useful in my work.â€ In the near future a 1 MGD wastewater treatment plant will be constructed in the Richlands area that will utilize infiltration ponds and membrane treatment of wastewater for the region. The ponds will be built adjacent to the river, which is classified as Nutrient Sensitive Waters. Frank Sanders, Director of Operations for Onslow Water and Sewer Authority (ONWASA) explains, â€œOnslow Water and Sewer Authority utilizes this gauging station now and will in the future because a regional water reclamation facility is going to be constructed on property just upstream from this gauging station. There are already concerns about water quality of the New River expressed by environmental groups and the North Carolina Division of Water Quality for this reach of the river. Quantifying the flow in the river will be important to not only Onslow Water and Sewer Authority that will construct and operate this wastewater plant, but will be used by multiple agencies monitoring the efficiency of the plantâ€™s operation. Additionally, I would think that it will be important for use in evaluating the effectiveness of efforts in determining the future Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for the river. We request that this stream gauge not be abandoned.â€ Susan Cohen, Coordinator of the Defense Coastal/Estuarine Research Program also utilizes this gauge. She writes, â€œThe loss of this gauge would impact our program for two reasons: 1. It is one of the few long-term gauges in Coastal NC. Most of the other gauges that measure flow into the estuaries have 10 - 12 years of record. This gauge has 50+. 2. We were leveraging this gauge as part of the New River work - If we lose the gauge, then we lose (1) our ability to calculate loads at Gum Branch, (2) our ability to determine the export from the watershed between Gum Branch and Jacksonville, and (3) our ability to place the hydrologic regime of the study period within a larger context of 50+ years of flows.â€ The stream gauge is also important for monitoring flow levels during tropical storms, hurricanes and other major rain events. Real-time data enables NC Cooperative Extension to assist farmers in managing their livestock through potentially hazardous circumstances. Sadly, even though the data collected by this gauge is of critical importance to citizens and the scientific community, its continued operation is threatened by a lack of funding. The gauge has been funded by several entities over the years, most recently by the North Carolina Ecosystem Enhancement Program (NCEEP). The USGS agreement with the NCEEP expired June 30, 2008. USGS continued to operate the gauge without funding but cannot continue to do so. Jeanne Robbins of the USGS explains, â€œIn the absence of a formal agreement we are no longer permitted to continue operation of the gauge. These funding agreements are entered into through the USGS Cooperative Water Program where USGS can provide up to 50% of the funds for operation of our data collection sites and hydrologic investigations. In this particular case, the USGS funds $6,600 and the *partnership amount needed is $7,400*, for a total cost of $14,000 for the current fiscal year.â€ Because of the impact of the loss of the gauge on various recreational and scientific applications it is imperative that we ensure continued funding for this essential resource. Please help us save our stream gauge. Sincerely, Tess Sanders White Oak-New Riverkeeper Elmer Eddy Stewards of the White Oak River Basin

Comment: This economy really scares me. My fiance' has been out of work for a full year now. There are no prospects and more places are closing. What are you going to do to help this improve? Our state is an at will work state. This means the employer can fire you for no good reason. My fiance' was laid off because of lack of work. They hired someone else because they could pay him less. They refused to give him a job in any way. So here he is, still looking. This needs to change. We shouldn't be dismissed like we don't matter. Please tell me you have a plan for our job shortage. Please tell me you have a way that will help us. Our unemployment is up more than 20 years and that's a scary thought. We're all counting on you. Make us proud.

Comment: Dear Governor: Congratulations again on your recent election. You certainly picked a challenging time to come to this office! Hyde County has developed a short list of projects they hope can be funded by the economic stimulus package. They include improvements at Mattamuskeet and Ocracoke Schools. Hyde is a low-wealth (median household income $28,000), sparsely populated county (5,800 persons) facing many challenges, especially in the education of its children. Is there anything I can do to help them promote their efforts? Thank you.

Comment: I read with interest your visit, along with HHS Secretary Lanier Cansler,to Chery Hospital in Greensboro. I am very new to the area and am very interested in getting a copy of the states budget for FY 09 and 2010 pertaining allocation of funding for the area of developmentally disabled. I see the title of your agencies are MH, DD and Sustance Abuse and am wondering how funding is allocated to each of those departments. That is why I am asking for copies of the state budget to see who gets what. I am an advocate for the mentally retarded (now DD) and would appreciate seeing those figures. In addition, does the state have separate facilities (hospitals) for the DD population or is there a mix? Thanks ahead of time and I wish you the best. Richard faucher

Subject: Unfair North Carolina Anti-Union Law

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue -- I was shocked yesterday to learn that you have not yet come out in favor of doing away with the currently-effective and benighted anti-union statute of North Carolina that forbids state employees to form unions for the purpose of collective bargaining. This kind of law is of the same ilk as the old-fashioned "yellow-dog contracts" of yesteryear labor-law practices in America -- which were used to require workers to agree to sign away their rights to form unions, just in order to get a job at all. Those kind of contracts are passe, thank goodness, for good reason -- they are grossly unfair to workers. To force a worker to sign such a contract in order for the worker to be considered for a job with a company is considered to be egregiously unfair all across America. Such a contract is considered to be a "contract of adhesion" with no legitimate moral, legal, or ethical basis. Yet, the State of North Carolina regularly imposes the same requirements on its hundreds of thousands of employees and teachers in a way that leaves the impression to people all around America that North Carolina is an incredibly backward state. I submit to you that it doesn't matter whether it is a private company or the State government that is doing wrong by workers, it is still just as unfair and immoral and unethical both ways. I supported your candidacy for the Office of Governor with the understanding and full expectation that you would do your best to be like our new President in seeking to bring needed change in government on behalf of regular people. Of course it would be quite easy for you to just leave things the way they are. But it takes real gumption to stand up to the right-wing politicians of North Carolina and say to them, "We must do the right thing. We must get North Carolina in synch with the rest of America with regard to our labor laws. We must give our State employees the right to form unions, so that they can have a fair chance to bargain in good faith on behalf of themselves and their families. We must quit our autocratic and antiquated ways of dealing with this issue." I suggest to you that in the long run this will only HELP all the people of North Carolina to thrive as citizens of a state that is considered to be modern and progressive. The arguments against this are very similar to the arguments that were used in the past to try to dissuade people from being in favor of civil rights and women's rights and rights for the disabled. I don't think that you want to be one that supports such ersatz arguments against state employees, do you? Please give some further thought to all this. Examine your conscience. Then do the right thing. Sincerely yours, James H. Dautremont, J.D. Formerly Asst. Prof. of Technical Writing East Carolina University
