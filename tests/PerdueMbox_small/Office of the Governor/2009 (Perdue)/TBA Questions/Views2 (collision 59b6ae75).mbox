Subject: NC WIldlife Commission corruption

Comment: I would like to express my deep disappointment in our states wildlife commission with this years accepted proposals. I am opposed to several changes they have made for the coming year. But one in particular, proposal H6 which make a uniform deer season for the state. The reason listed for the proposal was to eliminate confusion over which district you hunt in and when the season dates were. Personally, if you can not determine which hunting season applies for your hunting area you do not need to be hunting with a potentially lethal weapon. If you look at NC wildlife resource web page for comments posted in the "Proposed Regulations Public Comments Report”, the area affected by H6 is opposed by hunters and outdoorsmen 2 to 1. How can the commission pass this with such overwhelming opposition? Here is an opportunity to rid our state of a political corruption. Historically the NC wildlife commission has never preformed at a competent level and we need a new model. Is there any way to repeal this ordinance? Look to Tennessee, Florida, or Texas and see how much tourism revenue is generated as a product of a well run Wildlife management division. That is an opportunity that NC is missing out on. Please help me and other sportsmen in NC to repeal this ordinance or get rid of a commission that does want to serve the interests the citizens of NC. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, JP Stewart

Subject: Death Tax

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: My parents started our business in 1978 and they have been burdened with taxes, double tax, and triple tax since their start. My brother and I have worked in the company since we were young. I have worked full time in the business since 1986. I have put time, effort, stress and my life in this company. What right does government have in taking half of someone's assets after they die? My parent's assets are not the governments to have. Government did nothing to build this business but they want to take half of what they built when they die. If and when they do die all they will have is assets not cash, so my brother and I will have to take out loans to pay the government in order to keep the business running. How is that right? Please consider government's role to protect and serve, not take from Peter to pay Paul. Sincerely Kacy Denton

Subject: Public Health

Comment: Governor Purdue, Thank you on behalf of the Dr. Floyd Scott family for coming to the funeral of Gov. Robert Scott. I hope you felt welcome and filled with the history of his story. I would just like to bring to your attention plans to discontinue NC Epilepsy Services due to the budget crunch. I am a Clinical Social Worker at the Concord CDSA office, and a parent of a child with seizures, age 15. Throughout the years, we have benefited from the support and direction of this amazing service. I constantly refer parents of children in Early Intervention with intractable (poorly controlled) seizures to this service. One day in the office I looked up and a parent of a little girl with lesions on the brain had just walked in unannounced, looking for help. She was distraught. She had exhausted resources at the local level. Uncontrolled seizures steal away speech and language, contribute to mental retardation and autism, and turn the child into a walking experiment. Had I not had the Epilepsy Information line with Pat Gibson (1-800-642-0500) as a backup, I would have referred this woman to someone like you to try to get something done. My great uncle, Senator Ralph Scott, was head of finances during the passing of the PKU legislation, a simple test given to all children at birth; PKU causes mental retardation if untreated. Even though money was just about nonexisitent, the budget for testing was approved. Because the costs of the state caring for these individuals dibilitated by disabilities is so enormous... My son's budget is approx $60,000 per year... Wouldn't you want to prevent that any way you could? This program saves our state a lot of money. Please reconsider keeping Epilepsy Services in the budget! Very few people know that two other Scott elders had epilepsy. I think they would approve! Thank you for your consideration.

Comment: Governor Bev Perdue, My wife was employed with Johnston County Schools for about 12 years. Last year she made a move to Wake County Schools and she just found out that she would not have a job after June. This is going to be a big strugle for our family since we have two kids in college. I am also employed by Wake County Schools, so you see my concerns. I am not sure how we will be able to make it because its hard enough now. We thank God each day for what he has done for us and what he will do for us because without him we have nothing. I wanted to send you this because the school systems can not loose their people. So we will be praying that you will do what you can for the public school system and for our state. Thanks for your time, Ricky Horne

Comment: The Charlotte Mecklenburg School System needs to be divided up. There is no way one system can control the number of cities involved. Right now it is out of control. Something needs to be done to correct this problem. We can't afford to reduce the number of teachers. Every child deserves a quality education in uncrowded classrooms. I am a former school teacher and totally amazed that this has not been addressed.

Subject: North Carolina Jobs

Comment: Dear Governor Bev Perdue, I am president of Lyndon Steel Company in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Our annual volume is about $165M per year and we employee about 260 people (four plants in Winston-Salem, one in Yadkinville and one in Kinston). For the first time in my career (my career is over 40 years of age) I had to temporarily lay workers off. This was a difficult process for me, in fact if you have NEVER looked employees in the eye to tell them that they will lose their job, you would probably not understand the emotions I felt yesterday (and the last 24 hours). It was difficult for me to hold back the tears! However, to my point! We quote (or submit bids) on many projects throughout the country. We are seeing more and more projects that require (or give incentive to) instate subcontract participation. So if we submit quotes on these projects as an out of state subcontractor, we are at a distinct disadvantage. North Carolina seems NOT to have any requirement for instate participation. Jim Fain (N. C. Commerce Secretary) and I had discussions about this when Spirit Aerosystems announced their new project in Kinston, North Carolina. The interest was not there to require instate participation. By the way, the steel contract was awarded to a company from Florida! Our administration has published the fact that jobs are going overseas, but what about the jobs in North Carolina? We need your help to keep these jobs in North Carolina. I am asking that you work with our North Carolina legislators and guide them with the North Carolina FIRST philosophy. Thanks for your hard work in representing North Carolina, but we need YOUR help in keeping jobs here. David R. Morgan Lyndon Steel Company LP 336.785.0848 336.788.8835 Fax dmorgan@lyndonsteel.com

Subject: Health care budget

Comment: As you look at cost savings for health care, please keep in mind that care given at home is tremendously more cost effective than care given in an institution and historically comes with much fewer problems related to infections, depression, even staffing issues. Home care empowers people instead of warehousing them. Independence is what most people want. Please look at innovative ways to substitute home care for institutional care whenever possible as a way to decrease overall long term expenditures and improve quality of life. Thank you.

Subject: probation and teachers

Comment: At this time, teachers have no idea if a student is on probation. This seems detrimental in many ways. 1)Student may have been violent at some timee. 2) If a teacher were permitted to communicate with a student's probation officer, the student's attendance and behavior might greatly improve which would benefit both that student and the classmates. At this point most teachers find out about probbation if a student is "bragging".

Subject: The Message

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I have read your heartfelt message to our state and felt the need to respond. There are several things that I hope you and other politicians take to heart. First, my Senator and you both place the blame for our current situation on the "global crisis". You should take responsibility for your party's actions of the past decades and own up to mismanagement, wasteful spending, and greedy 'politics as usual' that have contributed to this situation. Second, referring to South Carolina's Governor decisions is nothing but political grand-standing. We have our own problems and referencing another state's decision-making while our state has one party running it into the ground is "the pot calling the kettle black". Lastly, I hope the supposed wrong-doing and corruption of the previous Governor's administration will be investigated and prosecuted, if criminal activity found. The situation of Gov. Easley's wife getting a 6-figure salaried position within a university with no interview process is wrong. People of this state are tired of the a single party ruining this state while passing the blame on to others - its time to step up and demonstate the leadership we have desparately needed for many years.

Subject: No Furlough for teachers

Comment: Their is talk of furlough for teachers. A day of no pay. Our salaries can't take a day of no pay. We are saturated with 12 month high dollars Central Office Staff. The work load there and the work load of teachers is night and day. Central office staff needs to be a 10- month or 11 month job with a salary reduction. I went to Central Office this summer and an employee said they had nothing to do so they were making 50 posters for a friend. You look at the $75,000 + salaries at that level and give them a 10% salary cut and go on an 11 month work schedule. Were are running on scraps in the classroom as it is. I spent 1200. of my own money to buy materials for my classroom. Thanks for listening.

Subject: David Ogden as Deputy Attorney General

Comment: I am writing to ask your support in opposing the nomination of David Ogden as Deputy Attorney General. It is my understanding that he supports the belief that the rules found in the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child are already binding on the United States under the doctrines of international law. I am currently homeschooling one of my children and the other is in public education. While I am an avid supporter and believer of our public education system, my home-schooled child is thriving in this environment. She was not thriving in public school. As a result of the flexibility from homeschooling, my child is getting additional exposure to many more scientific, artistic, musical, and social endeavors that she did not have during her years in the formal educational setting. She is also learning at a pace that we could not achieve in public school. I do not think it's appropriate for the government to mandate the educational direction my children take especially if I am following the legal educational requirements of my state as listed in the Division of Non-Public Education (http://www.ncdnpe.org). Your support in this matter will mean a great deal to me and to other families who share this belief.

Subject: government reform

Comment: Governor: I feel sorry for you. It must be very embarrassing. I know from my study of American history that it was the thirteen original states who came together to create the federal government. They put together the congress that composed the Constitution of the united States, and, as a result of the subsequent conventions held for this purpose, ratified that constitution, thus creating the federal government. But today, how often I see you and the other governors, hat in hand, begging from the federal government. It is clear now who is in charge. How embarrassing. It doesn't have to be this way. It is possible to reverse the relentless seizure of power that the federal government has pursued for the last two hundred years. The one missing piece in the constitution was a mechanism for its interpretation. A few years after it was ratified, that job fell by default to the United States Supreme Court. What a strange thing: a part of the federal government gets to interpret on behalf of the states the relationship they may have with that very same federal government! It is like allowing one of your children to determine the nature of the relationship between you and your spouse. The fix is simple, however. The fifty states should create the Constitutionality Commission of the States of America (CCSA). Each state legislature's upper house will appoint two members to the commission to serve at their pleasure, men and women of wisdom and a deep knowledge of, and love for, the Constitution of the united States. The Commission's job will be to review and decide on the constitutionality of every act of the federal government. The states will make it clear that they will no longer recognize the opinions of the Supreme Court with regard to constitutionality. The interpretation of the federal constitution should always have been the province of the states. Take it back. Can you imagine how different the world could be if you did? At least I would not have to be embarrassed for you anymore. Dwight Johnson Cherry Hill, NJ

Subject: State Health Care Plan, Pension Plans, Payment of state taxes by state employees

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: Congratulations on your election and I wish you unparelled success in your new position. As a retiree of a large corporation, I offer the following suggestions as you work toward a balanced budget. First of all, do an overall staff reduction. This is the action taken by the private sector when things get tough. Can we (the citizens) hear your plans on reducing the size of N. C. government? Most corporations either do not have pension plans or have scaled them back substantially over the last 15 years or so. There are 820,000 people covered by the N. C. Retirement Systems or one in eight working North Carolinians. It is a long process to reduce or phase out retirement plans but I am asking you to start the process. I do not believe that government employees should be compensated in money or benefits significantly above the private sector. Corporations require employees to pay montly premiums for health insurance if they are fortunate enough to have a company-offered health plan. I understand that you are not in favor of state employees/retirees paying a monthly premium for Health Insurance and there will be a vote this Monday. How can you NOT be in favor of state employees paying similarly to other citizens? Most North Carolinians pay substantial state income tax but I just read that "state employees pay very little in state income tax." Let's level the playing field for all N. C. Citizens because it is the right thing to do and a balanced budget, without an income tax increase, will be the reward. As a citizen of N. C. I am asking you to support a monthly health care premium for state employees and work through my other recommendations to create a level playing field in this state. Government, at all levels, has grown beyond the capacity of the citizens to support everything that is "required" of us. N. C. can show real leadership to our nation by being The Leader in reducing the size of government. Sincerely, Patsy Payne March 14, 2009

Comment: I know you are not as stupid as you would obviously like us to think. Please help us like you were elected to do instead of trying to force us to re-elect you. If you did the right thing we would re-elect you anyway. Mmm new theory. Stop stealing from our children, both by the education lottery that you promised you would not do, and by supporting this so called stimulus bill. We all know that that is nothing more than a bunch of politicians trying to get money to pay back campaign promises and to grow government. Don't worry, I already have apologized to my children for you governor. If you think that the American people are going to sit back and let y'all ruin our nation you will not see another re-election. Think about the children please. They should not have to pay for your mistakes!!!!! Thank You, A true American Citizen, Kevin Connor

Subject: Marijuana

Comment: Hello, Let me first say I did not support you or your party due to the obvious socialist theme displayed by liberal politicians in the last election. It is because of that issue that I do not expect anything but an automated response in return for my statements. I am a libertarian who believes in the personal freedom to make his own choice. I would like to ask you where you stand on the industrialization of marijuana? To just legalize this could be hazardous but to do that and develope it into an industry would be beneficial. Another industry the size of tobbacco would be beneficial to rescuing our citezens and state from debt. This would provide jobs and product to be taxed. If the consumer could obtain marijuana cheaper legally than off the street there would be less gang orginization due to the loss of a major source of income. This also would be less of burden on the tax payer because the judicial system would no longer prosecute petty users and free up jail space as well. Not only would product be used to smoke but also for the many other beneficial uses, creating an explosion of wealth on the economic tree. Thank you for your time, Art Vandalay

Subject: Our Future

Comment: I have attached a copy of the letter I sent to the President in January. This past week I sent his office an email update, and I am patiently aaiting a reply from either. not long after I sent that letter the company I work for announced pay cuts, then hourly cuts, and now we are told all field personnel will lose their jobs over the next 3 months. I am trying to get into a local college before that happens but it will be difficult to support my family and take classes at the same time. I am willing but the future is is not looking so bright right now. President Obama: 31 January, 2009 I hope this letter finds you and your family doing well, and I wish you all the best in the months and years ahead. I know your work keeps you very busy; there is much to be done. I have received the call to action from David Plouffe on your Organizing for America project and I wanted to share my situation with you. I have included the cover letter from my resume, and a copy of the reply I received from President George W. Bush to a similar letter I sent in 2005. Things in America have drastically changed since that letter was sent and while I received no other response then; my dreams are the same today but with renewed hope. I had requested information on creating a new business and completing a book project I was working on. The book is titled “Simple Times-Simple Lives” and it ties in with the creation of my studio “ Greg Kohlmann Arts” and the website www.gregkohlannarts.com which is now online. For most Americans the recession began in early 2007 as we all watched our livelihoods moved overseas, but back in 2005 I saw the need to reach out to fellow Americans and through my book share the true nature of the American spirit with the world. This is more important today than ever before in our history, we must become the beacon of light and hope we once were or watch our way of life disappear forever. Freedom, Honesty, Integrity, Love and Hope cannot be allowed to die on our watch. Mr. President, I know you have made great strides towards rebuilding America already and many, many Americans like myself are behind you 100%. Not only do we need to restore confidence in big banks and big business, but we need to restore hope for small business and every American, these are the true test of any recovery. Please allow me to help restore confidence in our system, share our dreams and way of life with the World, and maybe along the way create something truly unique and special. Any suggestions, comments, or ideas you can share are greatly appreciated as is any help you can give to keep my hopes and dreams alive. I am sincere in offering my time and talents to you for the benefit of all men and women of our great country and the world. Thank you for your time- God Bless America, and our presidential family. Sincerely: Greg Kohlmann

Subject: AIG abuse

Comment: Dear Congressman, Senators, News Media Please read this AP story. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Insurance-giant-AIG-to-pay-apf-14643226.html This AP story about AIG giving away $220 Million in bonus money this week is unacceptable. AIG claims to have lost $61 Billion due to bad management of their business in late 2008. Our congress threw $170 Billion from tax payers at them to cover this loss with no accountability for the loan and no due diligence on the request. Now AIG is giving out $220 million in bonus compensation to the same staff that managed to loose $61 billion !! AIG claims their hands are tied and due to contract constraints they must award this ridiculous compensation amount. Now AIG is willing to curb $9 million in future compensation for top executives .( all of 5% of the $220) What is wrong with this story !! Does AIG have a board of directors and cast of attorneys that are as corrupt and there management .. .absolutely. Do I care that they have contracts to pay absurd compensation for poor performance ...NO Do I care that they are unaccountable for how they manage there current business when they have MY money .. YES This bail out money to AIG started a wave of fraudulent bookkeeping in banking so others could get money to pad their bad management but continue to enjoy a lavish lifestyle. I have yet to see any business management executives that are requesting bailout monies, that reflects the poverty level of there claims. I insist that AIG return the 170 billion dollar LOAN and then let them pay out what ever they want in compensation. The law suits they incur for not paying of contract bonus payout monies is far less in value than the $170 Billion they have of my money and its there problem not mine. The AIG board of directors, the management team and the corporate attorneys needs to deal with there problems not - John Doe - American Tax payer. The shell game of bogus book keeping, finger pointing of what caused any big business to flounder and the smoke and mirror presentations to congress for charity bail outs has to stop today. AIG needs to return to basic business damage control and sell off there assets to make up for there bad management. Please propose an immediate recall of the funds given to AIG under false pretense of their massive financial loss. Tom McAvoy Waynesville, NC

Subject: North Carolina Education Lottery Game Show

Comment: Gov. Perdue, Hello. My name is Greg Palmer. I'm a college student who loves game shows. One of my favorites growing up was "Illinois Instant Riches". It was meant for the state of Illinois, but was seen nationwide on WGN Superstation. When I heard that North Carolina was going to have a lottery, I was somewhat split on the issue. As a Mormon, I oppose gambling. But I also remembered growing up as a kid. If you'd like to see it, here it is on YT: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SpTrdVVMUE http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ejQ_LX6nM http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6zZlwgEEvQ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2rtWESrdfw It's practically a 30-minute state lottery commercial. Ms. Governor, I know you may be the wrong person to take this idea to, but what do you think about it? Will you please discuss it at your next meeting? Thank you for your time. I hope to hear from you soon. Sincerely, Greg

Comment: Most of the highway rest stops in NC are within a few miles (or much closer) to businesses that have public restrooms. Closing the rest areas would save the state a lot of money but wouldn't really inconvenience the traveling public. And it might even help boost sales at stores in close proximity to the highways.

Subject: E-Libraries

Comment: American works best when information can flow freely. In the digital age the fastest way to reach the most people is through the Internet. This is why digitizing our libraries will be a learning revolution. One can find information with relative ease on the Internet. You cannot always count on the accuracy of the facts you find. Libraries are still the most reliable sources for information. Those of us who work well past local libraries operating hours and those who live far from any library would benefit from easy online access to knowledge and books. Local libraries do not have the same catalogs. You may want a novel or book on a subject they just do not have. A digital library would remedy this. From your local library or home you could access a national database supplied by the Library of Congress. All of their massive collection could be instantly at your fingertips. Physical books will never disappear. A screen cannot replace the joy of having a tactile connection with a book. While there is still something special about having a text in your hands, digitizing library catalogs can fill the need when that is not possible. The digital revolution has not only arrived it is in full swing. We must set the standards for education innovation once more. Digitizing our libraries for the masses is an essential step in that direction.

Subject: Current AIG bonuses

Comment: The president told them to have restraint in the future. If he stopped the current bonuses those crooks would have to seek OUR money in court, let them, or I'm switching parties, to the Republicans.

Subject: No Cuts for Community Mental Health

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue: I am requesting that there be no cuts in community mental health. With reform, our citizens living with serious mental illness have been treated even more as though they don't matter. Now is the time to send a message that you are starting to put an end to this nightmare we've been experiencing with reform. No cuts please. Lives depend on the little we have out here in community mental health. Thank you. Karen Kincaid Dunn

Subject: AIG - and stolen taxpayers (bailout) money

Comment: Why can't we as Obama supporters, Americans and taxpayers - file a class action suit against AIG for it's lies and deception. I find it hard to believe there is no way out of our tax dollars being "stolen" against our wills. We are not in an aristocracy government. We are in a democracy - a government of the people by the people and for the people. There are a lot of the government's "people" including myself - who do NOT agree with just letting this go. I am sure something can be done. Millicent Bowie

Subject: Rising Tobacco Prices

Comment: Hello and good morning, there is not enough space in this box to say all the things I want to say. So I will keep this one brief. I am a Smoker I like smoking I am not trying to quit nor do I want to. I LOVE HAVING A CIGARETTE ok, I also knew the risk when I started smoking. And guess what I smoke a pack a day and still run FIVE MILES A DAY!!. North Carolina has somew of the unhealthiest people in the nation. And they all blame someone elses smoking for their problems like....BEing fat when they should run a couple laps on the track. Basically there are a lot of people who dont smoke who cant even run one mile. Now that is besides the point. The point is that in places like NewYourk, there are people who cannot put their own forks down so they begged the state to ban trans fat because they needed someone else to blame for the fact that they ordered a cheeseburger instead of the chicken salad. It is people like that and people like you who support them in allowing them to sue resturants and such for making them fat. It is people like you who allow people to sue cigarette companies even though they read the package warning like the rest of us. It is people like you who allow people to sue the cigarette companies saying they got cancer from second hand smoke (which still has not been linked to cancer).It is also people like you who dont let people who are victims of drunk drivers sue alcohol companies the same way.(Which I am sure has something to do with the fact that more people drink than smoke, which means there are more drunk drivers, which means conseuently that one out of every three people in a bar drives under the influence, that means when your little office and employees have there public gatherings at public resturant or pub when there are ten of you, at least three will drive home drunk and put multiple lives at risk... but I am sure that the victims families would never be allowed to push a lawsuit through against your offices or officers. Funny isn't it. The price of alcohol has not skyrocketed the way cigarettes have though drunk drivers take multile lives in this state every hour of everyday. If you don't believe, why don't you try reading the reports your office puts out every once in a while. You clai that by raising taxes on cigarettes it will help people stop smoking because you care about the citizens health. that is a load of TOSH!!! Because if you really gave a care you would A)Ban the production of Tobacco in the State. B) Intall smoikng facilities for the public to smoke in and not affect those around them(such as those being used now in Tokyo and other civilized countries) C) You would ban the sell of tobacco in the state) D) Allow business owners the right to freely decide to be smoking or not and if a non smoker goes into a smoking bar that is their decision and vice versa. But since from what I can tell this is a cabinet based on deception I am not too surprised. The reality is all you want is MONEY just MONEY, people health has no merit weighed against MONEY. Because if you ban smoking you LOSE money,North Carolina produces more tobacco than any other state, our tobacco production rivals that of some tobacco producing NATIONS. Which in turn also tobacco is one of the top 3 crops produced and one of the highest taxed, which means if you did what you were really saying you wanted to do you would lose revenue unimaginable which would be enough to nearly cripple the state economy.Plus it is people like you and your cabinet making these horrible decisions that make people import stuff so that you get no revenue. Because who are you to tell me what I can and cnnot do. It is my body and my life and you have no right to tell me whether I can smoke or not. My voice as a smoker counts just as much as a non smoker. Maybe more since I am now paying more taxes, which non smokers will still benefit from.That is how I feel you are treating people, I did not vote to raise taxes, I voted to have an equal voice, but it seems that no one is listening. I cannot tell you or anyone else what you can and cannot do with your life, it is yours to do as you decide. So why should you be allowed to do the same to me. I smoke and If I go to a place that is non smoking, I deal or go somewhere else. So explain to me why it should not be the same for non smokers.

Subject: Don't cut funding for MH/DD/SA

Comment: I have two young sons who both have autism. Their continued progress and development depends on services offered through the Mental Health department. Please do NOT reduce ANY funding to state budgets that serve people who struggle with mental illness, developmental delays or substance abuse issues. To cut funding is equivalent to cutting lifelines of support for thousands of North Carolinians who need and deserve state supported services in an effort to survive with a modicum of success in their communities. Cutting funds to these services is another statement of failure by the State of North Carolina to adequately provide for their most fragile citizens. In addition, please do NOT reduce funding to educational programs that provide services and supports to special needs children in North Carolina and find a way to INCREASE funding sources to these vital programs. I appreciate your time and effort on this very important issue. Sincerely, Kim Feller

Subject: AIG Bonuses

Comment: Dear Govenor Bev Purdue, I do not normally e-mail but the AIG bonuses are outrageous! Our tax dollars are going to pay for that! A lot of bank got us into this mess. When I have to cut back on food, clothing, and other items, it really upsets me. So far my husband still has a job but it looks as if this summer he may get laid off. Thank goodness I work in the medical field (CMA, in a piediatric office)I believe my job is safe. Bonuses are for jobs well done. Millions of dollars in bonuses and we had to bail them out?! Job NOT well done! Greed has run amuck in Gov. I make my bills on time, I have no credit card debt, I am not on any goverment assistance, and for all my hard work I feel as if I am getting screwed! I am the one of many keeping our country afloat. Please address this with your fellow Govenors! Sincerely and outraged, Andrea S. Aldridge

Comment: Dear Ms. Perdue, I am writing you to let you know how deeply outraged I am as a US citizen and taxpayer at the AIG bonuses paid with taxpayer bailout monies. It is unconscienable that these people would even think of lining their own pockets when so many are hurting and the economy continues to fall down a rabbit hole! This (and the other bonuses paid for with taxpayer bailout dollars) is ECONOMIC TERRORISM and I call on you as my governor to help put a stop to it! Put a stop to this corporate and personal greed that is literally destroying this country overnight - even as we speak. Are we going down without a fight? I don't think so. Call out the national guard if you need to but GET THE MONEY BACK AND PUT THOSE PEOPLE IN JAIL FOR CRIMES AGAINST THIS NATION AND ITS PEOPLE. - Sincerely C Schultz

Subject: Program for 1st time offenders "

Comment: The law states that whenever a person commits a crime, the incidence has to stay on their record for seven years. Some employers will not hire an individual with a misdemeanor or felony. They cannot enroll in the military or be eligible for financial assistance in order to obtain a skill. WSOC TV reported on January 21, 2009 the story of a non-profit organization that was trying to open a transitional home for 20 women near a church. The Pastor J. R. Farrington made the statement, “I’m all for what they’re doing….”, but he felt he would be putting the children who attend his church in danger. This is the attitude of a man of God who should be teaching forgiveness. What is a person going to do for seven years? They still have to eat, buy clothes, find a place to live and support their family. Should they be forgiven for the crime they committed, no, but society has to allow them to redeem themselves. Even after they pay their debt to society, they are still labeled criminals. I realize they needed to be punished and they were, but if we don’t allow them to take care of their basic needs, they will revert back to what they know, crime. I would like the Legal System to allow them to make restitution, obtain some type of skill and become productive citizens. The Task Force recognizes that solutions to some of the challenges of the Criminal Justice System are limited by legislative and statutory mandates. However, the Task Force believes that it is possible to work within these constraints to improve the system. Additionally, establishing performance metrics that create accountability to the public served by the system and to governmental bodies that fund the system could solve problems. The Task Force delivered this report with the hope that the recommendations and observations included would lead to positive changes in the Criminal Justice System and reduce crime. The findings in their report could reduce the crime rate in North Carolina since we would be giving them (the offenders) hope, which could possibly deter them from becoming a repeat offender. We have given them not just another chance, but a chance to become a productive citizen. I am calling on my representatives to help implement the findings of the Task Forces recommendation number 8 and 15 expeditiously: Recommendation 8: Implement Alternative Solutions To Incarceration Implement and expedite alternative solutions to incarceration for first-time offenders. Key Observations: Alternative solutions have proven to be effective in reducing incarceration. It is necessary to provide alternatives to incarceration by providing workable alternatives as early as possible Recommendation 15: Effectively Use Citations and Warning Tickets Encourage the appropriate use of citations and warning tickets to increase the efficiency of the system. Key Observations: More frequent use of warning tickets and citations can eliminate the use and need of jail beds. It appears that there is inconsistent use of citations and warning tickets. Several previous reports have recommended a focus on increased use of citations. The use of citations and warning tickets would be effective as long as the offenders can demonstrate to the legal system that they are moving in a positive direction prior to their court date. I am an advocate for the population between the ages of 17-21. At this age they can make positive decisions about their life as long as they have a good support group. Again, I am seeking your assistance with helping to implement the recommendations of the Task Force. Please contact me at 704-568-8168 or e-mail me at livey2@bellsouth.net so I can further discuss how our program will be able to assist you. Sincerely, Lucille K. Ivey Founder, “Your Destiny”

Subject: Health Insurance, Home Owners Insurance, Automobile Insurance

Comment: I am a 20 resident and educator in Dare County. Last week, I raised my automobile deductible to 1,000 for each vehicle in my family to off-set an increase that had something to do with uninsured motorist liability. This of course still puzzles me as I have insurance which now must go up because other people don't????? More concerning is the prospect of my homeowners insurance increasing 22%. Five years ago, my husband and I built a home. He served as his own contractor, did the site work himself, built a garage to hold all of his tools and then over the course of a year and a half completed it. Absolutely everything that we could do ourselves, we did. As he would say, we have a lot of "Sweat equity" in this home. Unfortunately, I am honestly not sure if we will be able to remain in what I thought would be my dream home. My husband is a carpenter/maintenance man and the economy has certainly taken its toll on his business. As an educator, my income is fixed. I have started working summer school and clean cottages with a friend when I can. But, there is a limit to how much time anyone person can work beyond the school week. Now, on top of all of this, I find out that one of the few benefits we get, affordable prescriptions, is now changing as well. I already pay over 400 a month for health and have an additional 200 taken out in the flex plan to cover everything that isn't covered along with the co pay. It is absolutely impossible to save anything and I have a daughter starting college in the next year. Last week, I was in charge of housing homeless people at my church. Once a month, I am also in charge of distributing food through a mobile food drop. It is no longer difficult to understand how people end up in these circumstances. I just hope I am not next. I would also like to add that I didn't realize that when I cast my vote for June Atkinson that it counted for nothing! I didn't vote for Bill Harrison. I am also opposed to pulling money out of the so-called Education Lottery to use for other budget shortfalls. Of course, we all knew that the term "education" wasn't real.

Subject: Our Kids Need to GO Healthy

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: Have you looked around our communities? Nearly one out of every three children and adolescents are overweight or obese, making childhood obesity one of our nation's leading health threats. NC ranks 5th nationally in childhood obesity according to the Trust for America's Health 2008 F as in Fat report. Researchers suggest that the childhood obesity epidemic is also the result of a decline in regular physical activity. Too many young people have fallen into a sedentary lifestyle of long hours spent in front of a television or computer. To make matters worse, many schools are cutting back on traditional physical education programs because of budgetary concerns and competition from other academic demands. Our kids need and deserve the opportunity to be active during the day. If children don't get adequate physical education at school, the obesity epidemic condition will worsen and our children will be at a greater risk for heart disease and diabetes. Physical education is one of the most cost-effective steps that we can take to keep our kids healthy. We send our children to school to learn. We must require quality physical education in our schools so that we can empower our children with the knowledge they need to lead a healthy life. Much like reading - learning how to be physically active is a skill they will need to use every single day of the rest of their lives. September is Go Healthy Month - a time for kids to step up the plate as leaders in their communities to empower and inspire each other and their families to go health by being more physically active and eating healthier foods. As a legislative leader in our state, I call on you to "Go Healthy" for our kids and support requiring quality physical education within minimum standards in North Carolina's schools.

Subject: Cost Saving Idea

Comment: I watched your State of the State speech on UNC-TV, and you very clearly made your point about the need to save money--wisely. I am suggesting a possible small savings. Though I think that UNC-TV is one this State's finest resources (its locally produced shows such as "North Carolina Now" and "Our State" are outstanding), I question, however, the need to run the system all night in these times of austerity. The network might realize some savings in electricity as well as wear and tear on transmission equipment if UNC-TV were to close down at midnight a few nights a week and return to air by, say, six in the morning. From what I understand of the technology, the system's new digital UHF transmitters are especially power hungry. And I'm sure that late night audiences are small. Perhaps some of the savings could be used to reduce the impact of budget cuts on the network's daytime operations. Clearly, you have a difficult job ahead of you. You are running the equivalent of small country. I wish you well. CAG

Comment: We need to reduce health costs from the top down and not from the bottom up. I would start by having expensive medical equipment be approved by a national review committee if it cost more than $1000. Reduce needless duplication of equipment in competing hospitals.

Subject: NCDOT Bike Safety Poster

Comment: " NCDOT will send out a press release early in the month to encourage the concept of sharing the road and reporting the seriousness of bicycle injury and fatality rates in NC." WOW! "...encourage the 'concept' of sharing the road..." So since it's just a "concept," as NCDOT reinforces in the motoring public's collective minds, it really gives motorists an option of NOT sharing the "concept" and hence, NOT sharing the road. Thanks NCDOT!! I feel so much safer now, not! Please don't forget to mention this "concept of sharing the road" to the numerous motorists who intentionally force cyclists off the road, harass cyclists, throw glass bottles at cyclists and kill and injure cyclists on the roads of NC. How many cyclists were killed and injured in NC last year? One more poster, one more sign, yeah...that should work. Hans

Since I have voted- i have watched you take from our lottery funds that are supposed to only be dedicated to our childrens education and now I see where you want to tax only certain people. When I say certain people let me be more precise- The smokers and drinkers. I do not smoke and I drink very little but right is right and wrong is wrong- Why not tax only people who drive lexus cars....or BMW's.... how is that any different than JUST SMOKERS AND DRINKERs- these are freedom choices people make that I fought 16 years serving the Navy for... If it is a health issue- then why not tax ALL DRIVERS- The emissions cars put off are just as harmful... Please tell me your not playing the Lobbyist game with all the other crooks in washington. At 43 years old I am just so overwhelmed at how crooked government is- The AIG Bailout and I guess thats where all our money goes- the poor get taxed more and the wealthy- they go into politics... I can't believe our founders of this country meant for me to have to work 60 hours a week to pay 30 hours of that week in taxation.. Please Bev- Be Different- Make a Difference and BE FAIR- Smokers and Drinkers should not have to carry a STATE LOAD....thats just an easy way out that will not get you re-elected and there should be enough SMART EDUCATED people to think outside the box on saving- Not spending and getting our state back in fiscal shape.....

Subject: Mental Health Funding

Comment: I am a psychologist who lives in Harnett County and works in Fayetteville. Every day I see the increasing severity of effects of this economy on the mentally ill. Stress exacerbates existing psychological symptoms. If you choose to reduce mental health funding, the long term effects could be catastrophic. A priority of North Carolina's should be to maintain provisions of care to our mentally ill - they truly need it. Please consider the following requests: 1. Do NOT close or reduce funding to the Wright School or the Whitaker School . These programs and the services they provide to families in North Carolina are vital to essential behavior modification/re-training for youth who already struggle at home, in school and in their communities. Without such programs they will quickly become members of an invisible society in this state and another sad statistic of the failing mental health care system in North Carolina ; 2. Do NOT reduce ANY funding to state budgets that serve people who struggle with mental illness, developmental delays or substance abuse issues. To cut funding is equivalent to cutting lifelines of support for thousands of North Carolinians who need and deserve state supported services in an effort to survive with a modicum of success in their communities. Cutting funds to these services is another statement of failure by the State of North Carolina to adequately provide for their most fragile citizens; 3. Do NOT reduce funding to educational programs that provide services and supports to special needs children in North Carolina and to find a way to INCREASE funding sources to these vital programs.” Thank you, Margaret S. Mitchell
