Dear Chance Taylor,



I am responding to a message you sent to the Governors Office regarding hydropower. 



North Carolina (NC) will need a variety of renewable energy sources to build a sustainable energy mix for the future.  Hydropower is certainly one option but almost all of the best hydropower sites have already been developed in NC leaving many smaller sites.  These smaller sites can provide power but if NC wants to tap large amounts of renewable energy sources options like wind, solar, and biomass will also need to be developed.  All power development has some environmental impact.  Hydropower environmental issues include: submerging land and the loss of those ecosystems, downstream impact on water levels and sedimentation, and impact on plants and animals living along the waterway upstream and downstream of proposed dams.  In addition, hydropower energy is dependent on rainfall and stream levels so hydropower energy production is not constant.  Likewise wind, solar, and biomass sources all have their positive and negative points.



NC has no supplies of conventional fuels but we do have access to an array of renewable energy sources that are largely untapped like wind, solar power, biomass, and hyrdropower energy sources.  In addition, there are significant opportunities to utilize conservation technologies to use existing fuels more efficiently.  The State Energy Office has developed a State Energy Plan (see the link at <http://www.energync.net/epc/docs/Energy%20Plan%202005.pdf>http://www.energync.net/epc/docs/Energy%20Plan%202005.pdf ) that explains the current situation and describes strategic options NC can use to become more efficient and make use of renewable energy technologies. 



Thank you for your comments; it is indeed important that NC adopt sustainable energy strategies like hydropower to insure a productive, competitive future.   



Sincerely,



Bob Leker

Dear Governor Easley,

My name is Chance Taylor. I am writing this letter for extra credit in my science class. I am writing this letter about dams, if I want more or less dams in our state, also what kind of dam. I would like more hydroelectric dams. I think hydroelectric power is better than wind power because when the wind stops, it does not give us electricity. The good thing is that water does not stop.

Thank you and please respond.

Jill,



I spoke with Mr. Gerry Poulin, father of Liz Poulin, today. I explained the purpose of the NC State Government Internship Program residency requirement. Mr. Poulin informed me that their entire family relocated to NC in June of 2008 and although his daughter is attending a university outside NC, she is paying out-of-state tuition.

Given this information, I asked Mr. Poulin to submit a short explanation of why his daughter should be considered a NC resident and informed him that I would forward her application and his letter onto the NC State Government Internship Council for their review and consideration. Mr. Poulin appeared satisfied with this outcome and agreed to send me a brief explanation by January 21, 2009.  



Please contact me if you have any questions. I can be reached by phone at 919-789-5889 or by e-mail at <mailto:Stephanie.Nantz@doa.nc.gov>Stephanie.Nantz@doa.nc.gov.

Subject: Governor Perdue

Comment: I moved to NC just last July from NH. I'm writing to first congratulate you on your election. It wasn't that long ago that NH elected Jeanne Shaheen to office. I've been impressed with the tone that the governor's office has taken, and am expecting great things even in these difficult economic times. I also write in regards to my soon-to-be 21 year old daughter. She is currently in London in an internship with Parliament, and she truly gets "stoked" when one talks to her about government. She applied for an internship in NC, but was told that they only took permanent residents and that she was ineligible. I've requested that they explain why she is ineligible, since she moved with us back in July and has since gone back to college. So I write to you in hopes that somewhere in the governors office you would have a position she could hold this summer when she returns from the UK. You'll find that Liz is a well-spoken, thoughtful young lady, and would be an asset to any office. She truly loves her government studies and wants to pursue a career in that field. If you should need a copy of her curricula vitae or resume, please feel free to contact me. She can also be reached at her college address EP1200@messiah.edu a small liberal arts college outside of Harrisburg PA. Congratulations on your win, and know that we are watching and hopeful of your administration. Kind regards, Gerry Poulin

Dear Ms. Wood,



I am responding to you from the State Energy Office, North Carolina Department of Administration regarding a message you sent to the Governor’s Office about making North Carolina more sustainable. 



It is clear that energy and environmental issues are becoming more important as prices for fuels and power generation get more expensive and issues like climate change become more apparent.  North Carolina (NC) has no supplies of conventional fuels but we do have access to an array of renewable energy sources that are largely untapped like wind, solar power, and biomass energy sources.  In addition, there are significant opportunities to utilize conservation technologies to use existing fuels more efficiently.  The State Energy Office has developed a State Energy Plan (see the following link at <http://www.energync.net/epc/docs/Energy%20Plan%202005.pdf>http://www.energync.net/epc/docs/Energy%20Plan%202005.pdf  - this plan is currently being revised and updated) that explains the current situation and describes strategic options NC can use to become more efficient and make use of renewable energy technologies. 



Wind mapping completed for our state does show that there are significant wind resources in the mountains and at the coast. The State Energy Office has been actively engaged working with wind developers, environmental organizations, local governments, our university partners, and the U.S. Department of Energy to understand the NC wind resource, how to identify good wind sites, and environmental impacts from wind farms.  Additional information about coastal wind energy can be found at the following website  <http://www.ncsc.ncsu.edu/programs/The_Coastal_Wind_Initiative.cfm>http://www.ncsc.ncsu.edu/programs/The_Coastal_Wind_Initiative.cfm  and information about mountain wind energy in NC can be found at <http://www.wind.appstate.edu/index.php>http://www.wind.appstate.edu/index.php .  In addition, solar generated electricity can be utilized in many locations including residential rooftops, commercial rooftops, and ground mounted installations like those at the RBC Center in Raleigh or at the NC Zoo in Asheboro.   



NC also has an active alternative transportation program and information about program initiatives in the transportation sector can be found at the following website <http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/ncsc/transportation/>http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/ncsc/transportation/



Thank you for your comments regarding making NC more sustainable.  It is indeed important that NC adopt sustainable energy strategies to insure a productive, competitive future.

Mr. Tolbert:
Your email to the Governor was referred to me for reply. The Governor’s authority to lower flags is limited to state facilities but is offered as a recommendation to municipalities and citizens. Most North Carolina flags fly in tandem with the U.S. flag on state facilities, so in most cases both have been lowered (with the U.S. flag always above the state flag). Others may choose to lower flags to honor Governor Scott as they see fit.

Subject: Reducing state expenses in these difficult times

Comment: I cannot help but notice all the state owned/registered vehicles running around at all hours and obviously not on state business. I see people with children in the vehicle at shopping malls, restaurants etc. Now I wouldn't care if it wasn't part of my tax dollar that was paying for this. It seems to me that state owned/registered vehicles ought to be only used for state business and then in these times of hardship, only when absolutely necessary. I bet a review and tightening up in this area would net a sizable savings. As long as I am at it why not generate some more revenue by having the town police, county deputies and state patrol actually enforce the traffic and parking laws equally for everyone. Seems that fire lanes are frequently used as quick parking for those too lazy to actually park a vehicle.

Dear Ms. Turner,



I am responding to a message you sent to the Governors Office regarding developing a solar farm on your property.



At this timer there are no grants or “front end” funding available through North Carolina funds.  However, there are a variety of both state and federal tax incentives available for solar electric projects.  All these incentives are described at the following website  <http://www.dsireusa.org/library/includes/map2.cfm?CurrentPageID=1&State=NC>http://www.dsireusa.org/library/includes/map2.cfm?CurrentPageID=1&State=NC



You may qualify for limited grant and/or loan funding through the US Department of Agriculture REAP program (rural energy assistance program).  The following website has information about this program  <http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/busp/9006loan.htm>http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/busp/9006loan.htm



Some of the factors that may determine whether your project is feasible include: access to electrical transmission lines, clear solar access (no shading all day), and topography of the land.  For initial feasibility consultation contact the NC Solar Center at 1-800-336-2786.



Thank you for your inquiry.



Bob Leker

Dear Mr. Clarke,



I am responding to a message you sent to the Governors Office regarding solar incentives and installers. 



In North Carolina, there is a renewable energy tax credit of 35% up to $10,500 for the installation of a solar electric system at your house.  There is also a federal tax credit of 30% - using both reduces the total value of the credits somewhat depending on your tax situation.  Specific information about the both the NC energy tax credits and federal tax credits and other incentives can be found at   <http://www.dsireusa.org/library/includes/map2.cfm?CurrentPageID=1&State=NC>http://www.dsireusa.org/library/includes/map2.cfm?CurrentPageID=1&State=NC



The NC Solar Center maintains a list of renewable energy installers.  This list is similar to a “yellow pages” type of list.  You can access the list at <http://www.greenprofessionals.org/site/profd/public/browse.cfm>http://www.greenprofessionals.org/site/profd/public/browse.cfm  The search parameters can be specified by selecting the type of technology, profession type, location, etc.



Thank you for your inquiry on solar energy.  



Sincerely,



Bob Leker

No one is even asking them what really went on under the direction of Leann Hanson-Niver.

Ms. Chilton, Thank You for your prompt response.  However, for your information, I followed Options' policy and procedure in reporting issues relating to discrimination, harassment, and breach of confidentiality to Lee anne Hanson.  First, I went to her in person, and was "brushed off", second I went to Vivian Visco who was concerned enough to act, Third, I had to rewrite my grievance to satisfy Dr. Delma Blinson.   Fourth, I was intimidated and harassed by Dr. Blinson via email in regards to my grievances and finally told by him that I must have an attorney; Dr. Blinson will no longer communicate with me at all, saying that he will only talk to my attorney. 

Per your suggestions, it has been a waste of time in reporting to the ESC or NCDOL as they to don't appear to care about these violations and furthermore view the employer's justifications as the truth!   If your agency requires that Options have policy and procedures and you do not care if they are enforced then again, I ask you, which state agency does care as this appears to be a serious double-standard.

I will not be "bullied" into backing down as my complaints are legitimate.   Any dedicated professional should realize that these violations are serious and could negatively effect client services as well.    If you allow agencies to disregard policy and procedures; then you can only be "setting the stage" for serious program liabilities to occur, as well, wasting tax payer's money in agencies having to write and distribute these policies.  

Best Wishes,

Brandy Bishop


PS  So, if the NCCFW/DVC would not be the appropriate agency to air my personnel issues, which agency does a tax paying citizen report Options' non-compliance to policy and procedures to?    And, thus it would appear that you are telling me that per the last investigation of Options in relation to me, was a violation of your agency policy?

Visitor: Ms. Melisa Miles

Address: PO Box 1392, Wilmington, NC 28402

Email: milesmd@students.lmc.edu

Subject: Family Issues/Domestic Violence

Comment: My mother is a domestic violence survivor. When I was a little girl, I saw her get slapped, beat, and almost choked to death. Her abuser abused my brother and I also with anything he could get his hands on. Any little thing would make him mad. One day she had the courage to save herself, my brother and me - she took us to a domestic violence shelter who helped build her self esteem and build her own independence. Now she works for the University of North Carolina of Wilmington in the IT Division and getting another degree in film studies. She also does community plays. I never wanted to walk down the path my mother went through. Spring of 2008, I met a man significantly older than myself (22 years my senior). I never told my mother about him. At the time I was attending the four year Lees McRae College in the mountains of NC. He was charming at first. Everything a man would do to have a perfect relationship but I started to notice subtle differences - never thought anything of them really. I found out I was pregnant, unexpectedly and started seeing a counselor in July to help me cope with the issue. She told me, "I know you wanted to finish school and you still can, you're just going a different path that's all". By that time I wanted to end the relationship: it got to a point where I felt smothered, controlled. People would tell me "Lisa, he sounds obsessed". He's used my toothbrush, studied my clothes, went through my personal pictures and documents, used my perfume and deodorant, he even studied my razor. I'm pretty sure he knows everything about. He always knows what's my next move going to be. I had told him I do not want to talk anymore, simple as that. But it's like he can't comprehend leave me alone. So through my pregnancy I kept telling him to leave me alone. I finally got him to leave me alone when I shut my phone off. Moiralena (our daughter) was born November 11, 2008. I called him to come to the hospital. He wanted a DNA test. He assumed paternity before the results came back. During my second trimester he had expressed he didn't want to co-parent and that was fine by me. But then while I was in the hospital (I had Moiralena by c-section), he kept calling me and saying "you need to move in with me" or "we're a family now, let's make this work" or "don't let other people make decisions for you". The thought of a two parent family was attractive to me because I didn't grow up in a two parent home - my mother had divorced and then came her abuser. Since she left him, she's been a single parent ever since. So I moved in with him. My mother was outraged, she told me, "Lisa, you don't see the signs. He's abusive, he's controlling and manipulative". And I just thought my mother was crazy for saying that. But his whole attitude changed. He became someone different than who I originally met. When I first met him, he put off he was a college man who just moved into Wilmington (where I'm from, where this takes place) with a career. But I later found out he'd never been to college, not a career man, and already had been living in Wilmington. He became more controlling in the house. I wasn't allowed out without his permission. He had to know everything - where I was going, who I was with, what time I'm coming home. He wanted me to look a certain way, act a certain way, be a certain way. He even went as far as telling me that I must take a shower before getting in bed. So what I would do to avoid laying in bed with him was to go in the living room and not take a shower. But there'd be times he'd order me to take a shower and go to bed. We argued everyday. I know that arguing is not healthy for a child. I've experienced that when my mother argued with her abuser. He always asks, "are you going to get fat" or "you're not going to get fat on me, right". So he controlled whatever I ate. I'm at a healthy weight for my height - I take dance. I took dance at Lees McRae College for an elective. He even controlled what I could or could not do with our daughter Moiralena. I had to ask permission to take her for a stroll around the park. He can't even pronounce her name right - he misspells it everywhere he goes. Moiralena is just a thing to him, someone who he can call his. Only time he'd really let me out was for doctor appointments. He always threatens to hit me or slap me in the mouth. He's even threatened, "if you ever leave me, I'll fuck your mind up so bad, you have no idea where I'm coming from." He likes to come behind me and scare me to death - he finds that hilarious. I'm absolutely scared of him. I get even more scared of him when he drinks. He turns red all over. I'm terrified for Moiralena because he's threatened, "turn her over to me at two because imma beat her ass - that's the terrible twos and after that there's no more to be done". Every morning when he wakes up, he would start touching me. I'd either pull away or grab his hand so he'll stop but he's stronger than me so I'd just lay there. His favorite spot to touch was my c-section stomach, I'd tell him that's uncomfortable and to not touch but he didn't care, he'd do it anyways. He put his hands on me one night in the beginning of January after I had told him (indirectly) I can't live like that anymore and that I was going to take Moiralena and leave. He shoved me out of the house with no shoes or jacket and without Moiralena. In his mind, he thought I would bang on the door pleading to let me back in (to let him think he has that control over me). But I told myself that, "that was the first time he put his hands on me and that is the last time he puts his hands on me". I called my friend from across the street at a neighbors house. I didn't realize that he had snuck out of the house and heard everything I had said. He screamed across the yard and said, "you want to wait in the house for the cops to come". I didn't say anything, I was not going back in that house. The house where I couldn't leave, where I felt trapped. My friend came and picked me up and my next move was to get Moiralena out of there and file a restraining order. It was granted to me 3 days later (the incident happened on a weekend). DSS went to remove Moiralena but claimed they could not find me after I had told the sheriff's office that I was at the domestic violence shelter, I have moved back in with my mother now. So as of right now she's in their custody but they placed her with the paternal grandparents. I know she's safe there for now and I'm sure that while she's there, he comes over (which he's not suppose to do), his parents are there so he won't harm her. Now, I vowed to never go over there again. He knows that he lost control when I stepped outside and waited for my friend to come. But he does know how to regain control of me and that is to ask a judge for full custody and keep her from me, knowing Moiralena is my heart. He'll do anything to keep her from me, hurting my heart, controlling my emotions. I've pleaded to the judge for the year long restraining order because even though we are connected through our child, he will NOT leave me alone. The judge dismissed the case which was shock to my self but also to the spectators who gasped. Even the bailiff was shocked, the bailiff escorted us out making sure we were safe and also told us to call the sheriffs office to do regular drive bys of where I currently live. In that domestic violence court, he kept making outbursts, the judge would have to tell him off. The judge even had to stop the proceeding to tell his father off and yelled at him for having a toothpick in his mouth. The judge seen his demeanor, I just don't understand why he dismissed it. The judge told him in a firm voice before my court advocate and I left, "leave her alone, she doesn't want to deal with you anymore. If I found out you are texting her or calling her or making threats, then you will have to deal with me". He could avoid all that by signing the year long order of protection. I wish I would have done a background check on Mr. William Crawford Green, Jr. My aunt who does international law found 87 arrests and charges. My mother has found also he's been incarcerated. If I would have know, I would have never been involved. But I'm glad I got out of that relationship because it would have escalated to the point where he would hit me or start choking me and I feel lucky for getting out sooner than later. But now I have to prove to people who will not listen to me but to a convicted criminal that he is not "proper and fit" to raise Moiralena. Because of me being naive, I don't want Moiralena to suffer. She shouldn't have to, she's only 10 weeks old, a baby. It sounds like to me the Wilmington DSS want to wait until marks show up on her body to say, he's not a fit parent. But we can avoid all of that hurt. I went through being abused myself, walking on eggshells, getting hit because I don't like eating oatmeal from my mother's abuser. Moiralena is my heart, I'll do anything to get her back and in a safe and loving environment. I DO NOT want my daughter to ever walk down the path my mother and I have walked down. In 8 years, I will have my masters in psychology and a house in 10 years. I'm doing this not only for myself but for Moiralena who deserves everything I never had. But it's getting to that point where I might have to leave the country because I know once DSS gives me custody, he will stop at nothing to find me and control me once again. I just need help on what to do about not getting heard by DSS or a domestic violence judge. What can I do to get my daughter back where she'll be loved forever and not abused by a man who's been convicted and served prison time. I just want my child to be safe.

Ms. Lucas,

I am requesting a copy of the letter from Ms. Chilton (the CFW) to Options (Delma Blinson, Lee Ann Hanson-Niver, or their BOD) as indicated in the article in the Beaufort Observer on February 18 and any and all correspondence (including emails) from the CFW (Mel Chilton, Robin Colbert, June Michaux or Leslie Parker) to Options ( Lee Ann Hanson-Niver, Delma Blinson, Trent Tetterton or any BOD members) and correspondence (including emails) from Options (including all listed above) to the CFW (including all listed above) since August 1, 2007. 

Also I am requesting all Budget Proposals (including the minutes of the BOD approving the Budget), Applications for DV/SA/DH funds, Projected Income Statements, Monthly Reports, Reports of Explanation, Budget Transfer Requests, Semi-Annual Financial Status Reports, Grantee Inventory Lists, and any supporting documents concerning the finances of Options for DV grants, SA grants and DH grants from January 1, 2008 to the date you send me the information.

All of the above I am requesting under the Governors Executive Order #4, the Sunshine Law, and the Freedom of Information Act. 

I am very disturbed that since February 11, we have been led to believe that no action has been taken and no
determinations were made concerning refunding Options and we had to learn the results of the review (despite my requests for this information under the Governors Executive Order #4, the Sunshine Law and the Freedom of Information Act) in an article by Jay Niver (husband of Lee Ann Hanson-Niver) in the Beaufort Observer.  Obviously, this has been decided prior to my emails listed below some time before the release of the article in the Beaufort Observer on February 18 shown below. According to the article, Ms.Chilton wrote Tuesday that one quarter of the money would be released.   Well, Tuesday was February 17 and I received an email on February 18 that "Nothing has changed". 

 (Read the emails from the bottom up......)

	State resumes funding of Options
<http://beaufortobserver.net/1editorialtablebody.lasso?-token.searchtype=authorroutine&-token.lpsearchstring=Jay%20Niver/Editor>Jay Niver/Editor
February 18, 2009
The N.C. agency withholding grant money that would keep a locally based, five-county domestic-violence agency alive said Tuesday it is "committed to helping Options re-establish its funding, staff, training ... (and) internal controls to operate the organization effectively and efficiently."

"We look forward to working with you in the future," Council for Women/Domestic Violence Commission Executive Director Mel Chilton wrote to Options Board President Delma Blinson.

Chilton said her staff "stands ready to offer our assistance to your organization."

Negotiations between CFW and Options have spanned months, and Options has had no funding from the state since last June.

Chilton wrote Tuesday that one quarter's money would be released, enough to keep Options breathing through March, provided that Options proceeds with plans to hire a new director and fill out its board with members from each of the counties it serves.

"I think this is good progress, that CFW is committed to freeing some of the funds," Blinson said, adding that Options' Board of Directors would have to approve any agreement with CFW. He said a board meeting would be called "as soon as possible."

Still, Blinson expressed reservations about Options' ability to hire a director with no assurance of funding past March.

"Who's going to come to work somewhere when there's no guarantee that he or she will be paid? How are we supposed to recruit anybody, let alone a top-flight administrator?"

Blinson said key staff have been working for months for reduced or no pay to keep Options functioning: "The loyal staff that has continued to work should be paid what they are owed, and I believe that is one of our board's highest priorities."

"Releasing funds for the current quarter does nothing to address the issue of getting our people caught up on what's due them," said Blinson. "If we're not permitted to use current funding to pay back debts, it will be hard to meet the conditions" CFW has set.

"I wonder how many of the people in Raleigh would go to work every day, and do it for months, not knowing if they would be paid," Blinson added.

News of Options' growing plight, and the departure of Executive Director Lee anne Hanson, prompted some women to do fundraising on their own. Last week, a slow but steady stream of benefactors visited the agency's office to bring personal checks and even small amounts of cash.

Hanson had told the media earlier that she was unsure if there was enough money "left to pay the light bill."

Said Blinson, "Hopefully, with the Council for Women behind us again, this kind of hand-to-mouth existence can be ended. The real tragedy in all this is that some in Raleigh seem to not be concerned about our victims of domestic violence. If they were, we wouldn't have gone eight months without funding."

I have contacted Britt Cobb, McKinley Wooten, and June Michaux, no one will answer. I sent them an e-mail several months ago and asked that they respond if any information in the e-mail was false. This issue is pertaining to over $100k in taxpayers dollars, well worth an answer. I feel my e-mails have been deleted before being read. I have placed a request with Jill Lucas of the Dept of Administration to see if there is any record of my communications. I know you're busy, but at least acknowledge that you recieved this.

I am inquiring as to when Options to Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, Inc. in Washington, NC will be posting an ad for a replacement Executive Director as it is my understanding that Lee Anne Hanson-Niver

has resigned.    I hope Options will not be able to continue their previous policy of hiring friends and associates in order to continue the power and control within this agency as conflicts of interest already exist in this agency.  I would hope that the GCC, CFW, OSA and the Governor's Office  would be interested in sending to Options a very strong suggestion that they advertise widely, possibly through the NCCADV, for the most qualified person for this position.  Please advise me on your position concerning this matter.



I am also requesting information concerning an "ongoing review" by the CFW concerning this agency as to whether the CFW will continue contracting with and funding this agency and if the issues indicated in the review by the OSA have been resolved and if the funds in question in the OSA review will be required to be

repaid to the State.  (This request is made under the Governor's Executive Order #4, the Sunshine Law, and the Freedom of Information Act.)



Sincerely,

Here is another article in a newspaper about the refunding of Options.  (I previously sent an article from the Beaufort Observer with copies of emails from the state that there was "no change" in the determination of refunding Options.)  Again I have not heard any word from state officials about the "review" being conducted by the CFW after repeated requests for the results of the review under the Freedom of Information Act, Sunshine Law, and the Governors Executive Order #4.  Obviously, I have been denied information that has been available but not afforded to me.  I am very disturbed at this avoidance tactic.

State agency reinstates funding for Options

Support group may have money by next week

By TED STRONG

Staff Writer

A key state agency has reinstated funding to a local domestic-violence support group.

The state sent a contract for renewed funding to Options to Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, which its board accepted unanimously Thursday, said spokesman Trent Tetterton.

The funding will allow Options to stay open through the end of March, he said. The group hopes to have a check by the middle of next week.

â€œThis a long-standing matter, and there have been discussions with the board and with counsel and staff, and weâ€™re making every effort to resolve this matter,â€ said Jill Lucas, spokeswoman for the N.C. Department of Administration, which controls state funding for Options.

Options â€” which is based in Washington â€” had for years provided advocacy and shelter services for battered women in Beaufort, Hyde, Martin, Tyrrell and Washington counties.

But after a long fight with the state over grant funding, the organization ran out of funds, and other groups have been getting money to serve the area.

â€œWe are out of funding, period,â€ Tetterton said. â€œActually, just today (Thursday) weâ€™ve had to turn down our first victim, because the shelter is not staffed at this point because of lack of funding.â€

The group lost its funding after the Governorâ€™s Crime Commission determined it owed almost $52,000 in grant funds that either werenâ€™t spent or were spent on items not covered by the grants.

With some funding restored, the shelter will begin working to restaff, Tetterton said.

Since Options funding was revoked, authority for grant funding has been split between two entities. The crime commission controls federal money, which it has been redistributing to other nearby groups, and the Department of Administration controls state grants.

The decision on whether to restore funding was delayed while the Office of the State Auditor reviewed Optionsâ€™ finances. That review found funds had been poorly accounted for and spent on unapproved items, but not stolen.

Options board member Darwin Woolard said the funding is essential to the well-being of women in the five-county area.

â€œOptions has got to be saved,â€ he said. â€œWeâ€™ve got to do what is right to make sure that the women in all five counties that we serve have the help that they need.â€

He added later, â€œIâ€™m not comparing them, but if we must (at the stateâ€™s behest) have an animal shelter in every county, I donâ€™t see why we should not have ample care for battered women and for children in all five of these counties.â€

Woolard said Options is trying to turn over a new leaf with the state. The group has already found a new financial officer and is looking for a new executive director, he said.

â€œWeâ€™re hoping to find someone that will be able to be strong and put other programs in place to make that program even stronger,â€ he said.

An executive director search committee has been formed: Its members are Tetterton; Carol Williams, the groupâ€™s new finance officer; and group Attorney Wayland J. Sermons Jr.

Hiring a new executive director is one of the contractâ€™s stipulations, Tetterton said. He noted the contract also requires Options to find board members from each of the counties it serves. Options has identified potential board members, but has waited to bring them on board until funding was secured, Tetterton said.

Seth Edwards, district attorney for the prosecution district that includes Beaufort County, will serve on the board, Tetterton said. Options is seeking members from Hyde, Tyrrell and Washington counties, he added.

Lucas said the state is still waiting for the contract to be returned with signatures.

â€œWeâ€™ll certainly take appropriate action when we receive it,â€ she said.

Ann:

Good morning. Your inquiry to the Governor’s Office was referred to me for reply. We’ll check on our end why your email to June Michaux did not go through – you have her correct address and I assure you that you are not being blocked. You have an old email address, however, for Secretary Cobb, which might explain why his bounced back. His correct address is <mailto:britt.cobb@doa.nc.gov>britt.cobb@doa.nc.gov.

Regardless, you know that you can always contact me when you need information. We understand that the Options board has approved the revised contract, so an update regarding the Council for Women/Domestic Violence Commission’s relationship with the organization should be available as soon as we receive the signed document.

To Whom It May Concern: 


February 21, 2009

This letter is in reference to the North Carolina Department of Administration/North Carolina Council for Women's recent reimbursement of funding to Options to Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault, Inc. in Washington, NC.   Taxpayers of Beaufort, Hyde, Washington, Tyrrell and Martin counties should be afforded the truth and justification in this funding disbursement as Options' has many outstanding complaints against its administrative team.



In an email to me, Brandy Bishop;  Mel Chilton, Executive Director writes:

As a former employee of a nonprofit, Options, a grievance policy was in place to voice your concerns with the Board President, Delma Blinson. Your grievance must be filed with Dr. Blinson.  Additionally, you have the right to file a claim with the Employment Security Commission if you feel you have been mistreated in the workplace.  The Council for Women/Domestic Violence Commission is responsible for the fiscal oversight of the program and services to the clients. We do not have authority over the personnel issues within the organization.     

NCCFW/DVC would not be the appropriate agency to air your personnel issues.

Best wishes,

Mel

Mel L. Chilton

Executive Director

NC Council for Women/ Domestic Violence Commission

I, Brandy Bishop Replied:  

Ms. Chilton, Thank You for your prompt response.  However, for your information, I followed Options' policy and procedure in reporting issues relating to discrimination, harassment, and breach of confidentiality to Lee anne Hanson.  First, I went to her in person, and was "brushed off", second I went to Vivian Visco who was concerned enough to act, Third, I had to rewrite my grievance to satisfy Dr. Delma Blinson.   Fourth, I was intimidated and harassed by Dr. Blinson via email in regards to my grievances and finally told by him that I must have an attorney; Dr. Blinson will no longer communicate with me at all, saying that he will only talk to my attorney. 

Per your suggestions, it has been a waste of time in reporting to the ESC or NCDOL as they to don't appear to care about these violations and furthermore view the employer's justifications as the truth!   If your agency requires that Options have policy and procedures and you do not care if they are enforced then again, I ask you, which state agency does care as this appears to be a serious double-standard.

I will not be "bullied" into backing down as my complaints are legitimate.   Any dedicated professional should realize that these violations are serious and could negatively effect client services as well.    If you allow agencies to disregard policy and procedures; then you can only be "setting the stage" for serious program liabilities to occur, as well, wasting tax payer's money in agencies having to write and distribute these policies.  

Best Wishes,

Brandy Bishop


PS  So, if the NCCFW/DVC would not be the appropriate agency to air my personnel issues, which agency does a tax paying citizen report Options' non-compliance to policy and procedures to?    And, thus it would appear that you are telling me that per the last investigation of Options in relation to me, was a violation of your agency policy? 



















**********************************************************

Please note that to date, Ms. Chilton has not responded to the questions that I  have asked.    Also, Ms. Chilton's agency requires Options to have internal controls which relate directly to personnel issues.   But it appears that Ms. Chilton's agency has no obligation to see that these policies are adhered to.    Hence, why is the state wasting taxpayers dollars in demanding that funded agencies have these policies as it takes a vast amount of time and effort on agencies parts to write and submit these policies to the state on a much-requested basis ?  And why have what is not enforceable - this is a double standard that needs to be addressed ASAP. 

It appears that with funding being restored to Options by Ms. Chilton's agency that she has written a letter to Delma Blinson as reported in the Beaufort Observer today that her agency is "COMMITTED TO HELPING OPTIONS REESTABLISH ITS FUNDING, STAFF, INTERNAL CONTROLS TO OPERATE THE ORGANIZATION EFFECTIVELY AND SUFFICIENTLY.'    Now, her agency has done nothing to help the scores of employees alleging abuse by Options, and it appears that under Ms. Chilton's care that Options' can do whatever they please including disregarding policy and procedures or internal controls.   Please correct me if I am wrong.

Don't you think that taxpaying citizens have the right to know about this double - standard and don't you think that many would be outraged that an agency such as Options can do as it pleases, so to speak!   Yet above Ms. Chilton states in her letter she is committed to staff.  

As of today I still have 3 grievances pending plus a termination appeal - Options' policy states that grievances are to be heard within 30 days and mine have been outstanding since July - but again, Options' appears to be allowed to abuse its policy and procedures. 

I would appreciate a response - Brandy

Governor’s Crime Commission is part of the NC Department of Crime Control and Public Safety and we do not speak on their behalf. You can contact Julia Jarema regarding GCC issues at <mailto:jjarema@nccrimecontrol.org>jjarema@nccrimecontrol.org.

We are in the process of collecting the emails you requested. Please note that McKinley Wooten is no longer with the NC Department of Administration, so it may take some time to collect emails from his old address. June Michaux indicated that her email contact with you is limited to the two emails you’ve sent to her in the past week – including the one below.

The Council for Women/Domestic Violence Commission has not yet received the signed contract from the Options board, so no funding has been released at present.

Here is another article in a newspaper about the refunding of Options.  (I previously sent an article from the Beaufort Observer with copies of emails from the state that there was "no change" in the determination of refunding Options.)  Again I have not heard any word from state officials about the "review" being conducted by the CFW after repeated requests for the results of the review under the Freedom of Information Act, Sunshine Law, and the Governors Executive Order #4.  Obviously, I have been denied information that has been available but not afforded to me.  I am very disturbed at this avoidance tactic.

State agency reinstates funding for Options

Support group may have money by next week

By TED STRONG

Staff Writer

A key state agency has reinstated funding to a local domestic-violence support group.

The state sent a contract for renewed funding to Options to Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, which its board accepted unanimously Thursday, said spokesman Trent Tetterton.

The funding will allow Options to stay open through the end of March, he said. The group hopes to have a check by the middle of next week.

“This a long-standing matter, and there have been discussions with the board and with counsel and staff, and we’re making every effort to resolve this matter,” said Jill Lucas, spokeswoman for the N.C. Department of Administration, which controls state funding for Options.

Options — which is based in Washington — had for years provided advocacy and shelter services for battered women in Beaufort, Hyde, Martin, Tyrrell and Washington counties.

But after a long fight with the state over grant funding, the organization ran out of funds, and other groups have been getting money to serve the area.

“We are out of funding, period,” Tetterton said. “Actually, just today (Thursday) we’ve had to turn down our first victim, because the shelter is not staffed at this point because of lack of funding.”

The group lost its funding after the Governor’s Crime Commission determined it owed almost $52,000 in grant funds that either weren’t spent or were spent on items not covered by the grants.

With some funding restored, the shelter will begin working to restaff, Tetterton said.

Since Options funding was revoked, authority for grant funding has been split between two entities. The crime commission controls federal money, which it has been redistributing to other nearby groups, and the Department of Administration controls state grants.

The decision on whether to restore funding was delayed while the Office of the State Auditor reviewed Options’ finances. That review found funds had been poorly accounted for and spent on unapproved items, but not stolen.

Options board member Darwin Woolard said the funding is essential to the well-being of women in the five-county area.

“Options has got to be saved,” he said. “We’ve got to do what is right to make sure that the women in all five counties that we serve have the help that they need.”

He added later, “I’m not comparing them, but if we must (at the state’s behest) have an animal shelter in every county, I don’t see why we should not have ample care for battered women and for children in all five of these counties.”

Woolard said Options is trying to turn over a new leaf with the state. The group has already found a new financial officer and is looking for a new executive director, he said.

“We’re hoping to find someone that will be able to be strong and put other programs in place to make that program even stronger,” he said.

An executive director search committee has been formed: Its members are Tetterton; Carol Williams, the group’s new finance officer; and group Attorney Wayland J. Sermons Jr.

Lucas said the state is still waiting for the contract to be returned with signatures.

“We’ll certainly take appropriate action when we receive it,” she said.

I am inquiring as to when Options to Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, Inc. in Washington, NC will be posting an ad for a replacement Executive Director as it is my understanding that Lee Anne Hanson-Niver

has resigned.    I hope Options will not be able to continue their previous policy of hiring friends and associates in order to continue the power and control within this agency as conflicts of interest already exist in this agency.  I would hope that the GCC, CFW, OSA and the Governor's Office  would be interested in sending to Options a very strong suggestion that they advertise widely, possibly through the NCCADV, for the most qualified person for this position.  Please advise me on your position concerning this matter.



I am also requesting information concerning an "ongoing review" by the CFW concerning this agency as to whether the CFW will continue contracting with and funding this agency and if the issues indicated in the review by the OSA have been resolved and if the funds in question in the OSA review will be required to be

repaid to the State.  (This request is made under the Governor's Executive Order #4, the Sunshine Law, and the Freedom of Information Act.)



Sincerely,

Subject: Family Issues/Domestic Violence

Comment: My mother is a domestic violence survivor. When I was a little girl, I saw her get slapped, beat, and almost choked to death. Her abuser abused my brother and I also with anything he could get his hands on. Any little thing would make him mad. One day she had the courage to save herself, my brother and me - she took us to a domestic violence shelter who helped build her self esteem and build her own independence. Now she works for the University of North Carolina of Wilmington in the IT Division and getting another degree in film studies. She also does community plays. I never wanted to walk down the path my mother went through. Spring of 2008, I met a man significantly older than myself (22 years my senior). I never told my mother about him. At the time I was attending the four year Lees McRae College in the mountains of NC. He was charming at first. Everything a man would do to have a perfect relationship but I started to notice subtle differences - never thought anything of them really. I found out I was pregnant, unexpectedly and started seeing a counselor in July to help me cope with the issue. She told me, "I know you wanted to finish school and you still can, you're just going a different path that's all". By that time I wanted to end the relationship: it got to a point where I felt smothered, controlled. People would tell me "Lisa, he sounds obsessed". He's used my toothbrush, studied my clothes, went through my personal pictures and documents, used my perfume and deodorant, he even studied my razor. I'm pretty sure he knows everything about. He always knows what's my next move going to be. I had told him I do not want to talk anymore, simple as that. But it's like he can't comprehend leave me alone. So through my pregnancy I kept telling him to leave me alone. I finally got him to leave me alone when I shut my phone off. Moiralena (our daughter) was born November 11, 2008. I called him to come to the hospital. He wanted a DNA test. He assumed paternity before the results came back. During my second trimester he had expressed he didn't want to co-parent and that was fine by me. But then while I was in the hospital (I had Moiralena by c-section), he kept calling me and saying "you need to move in with me" or "we're a family now, let's make this work" or "don't let other people make decisions for you". The thought of a two parent family was attractive to me because I didn't grow up in a two parent home - my mother had divorced and then came her abuser. Since she left him, she's been a single parent ever since. So I moved in with him. My mother was outraged, she told me, "Lisa, you don't see the signs. He's abusive, he's controlling and manipulative". And I just thought my mother was crazy for saying that. But his whole attitude changed. He became someone different than who I originally met. When I first met him, he put off he was a college man who just moved into Wilmington (where I'm from, where this takes place) with a career. But I later found out he'd never been to college, not a career man, and already had been living in Wilmington. He became more controlling in the house. I wasn't allowed out without his permission. He had to know everything - where I was going, who I was with, what time I'm coming home. He wanted me to look a certain way, act a certain way, be a certain way. He even went as far as telling me that I must take a shower before getting in bed. So what I would do to avoid laying in bed with him was to go in the living room and not take a shower. But there'd be times he'd order me to take a shower and go to bed. We argued everyday. I know that arguing is not healthy for a child. I've experienced that when my mother argued with her abuser. He always asks, "are you going to get fat" or "you're not going to get fat on me, right". So he controlled whatever I ate. I'm at a healthy weight for my height - I take dance. I took dance at Lees McRae College for an elective. He even controlled what I could or could not do with our daughter Moiralena. I had to ask permission to take her for a stroll around the park. He can't even pronounce her name right - he misspells it everywhere he goes. Moiralena is just a thing to him, someone who he can call his. Only time he'd really let me out was for doctor appointments. He always threatens to hit me or slap me in the mouth. He's even threatened, "if you ever leave me, I'll fuck your mind up so bad, you have no idea where I'm coming from." He likes to come behind me and scare me to death - he finds that hilarious. I'm absolutely scared of him. I get even more scared of him when he drinks. He turns red all over. I'm terrified for Moiralena because he's threatened, "turn her over to me at two because imma beat her ass - that's the terrible twos and after that there's no more to be done". Every morning when he wakes up, he would start touching me. I'd either pull away or grab his hand so he'll stop but he's stronger than me so I'd just lay there. His favorite spot to touch was my c-section stomach, I'd tell him that's uncomfortable and to not touch but he didn't care, he'd do it anyways. He put his hands on me one night in the beginning of January after I had told him (indirectly) I can't live like that anymore and that I was going to take Moiralena and leave. He shoved me out of the house with no shoes or jacket and without Moiralena. In his mind, he thought I would bang on the door pleading to let me back in (to let him think he has that control over me). But I told myself that, "that was the first time he put his hands on me and that is the last time he puts his hands on me". I called my friend from across the street at a neighbors house. I didn't realize that he had snuck out of the house and heard everything I had said. He screamed across the yard and said, "you want to wait in the house for the cops to come". I didn't say anything, I was not going back in that house. The house where I couldn't leave, where I felt trapped. My friend came and picked me up and my next move was to get Moiralena out of there and file a restraining order. It was granted to me 3 days later (the incident happened on a weekend). DSS went to remove Moiralena but claimed they could not find me after I had told the sheriff's office that I was at the domestic violence shelter, I have moved back in with my mother now. So as of right now she's in their custody but they placed her with the paternal grandparents. I know she's safe there for now and I'm sure that while she's there, he comes over (which he's not suppose to do), his parents are there so he won't harm her. Now, I vowed to never go over there again. He knows that he lost control when I stepped outside and waited for my friend to come. But he does know how to regain control of me and that is to ask a judge for full custody and keep her from me, knowing Moiralena is my heart. He'll do anything to keep her from me, hurting my heart, controlling my emotions. I've pleaded to the judge for the year long restraining order because even though we are connected through our child, he will NOT leave me alone. The judge dismissed the case which was shock to my self but also to the spectators who gasped. Even the bailiff was shocked, the bailiff escorted us out making sure we were safe and also told us to call the sheriffs office to do regular drive bys of where I currently live. In that domestic violence court, he kept making outbursts, the judge would have to tell him off. The judge even had to stop the proceeding to tell his father off and yelled at him for having a toothpick in his mouth. The judge seen his demeanor, I just don't understand why he dismissed it. The judge told him in a firm voice before my court advocate and I left, "leave her alone, she doesn't want to deal with you anymore. If I found out you are texting her or calling her or making threats, then you will have to deal with me". He could avoid all that by signing the year long order of protection. I wish I would have done a background check on Mr. William Crawford Green, Jr. My aunt who does international law found 87 arrests and charges. My mother has found also he's been incarcerated. If I would have know, I would have never been involved. But I'm glad I got out of that relationship because it would have escalated to the point where he would hit me or start choking me and I feel lucky for getting out sooner than later. But now I have to prove to people who will not listen to me but to a convicted criminal that he is not "proper and fit" to raise Moiralena. Because of me being naive, I don't want Moiralena to suffer. She shouldn't have to, she's only 10 weeks old, a baby. It sounds like to me the Wilmington DSS want to wait until marks show up on her body to say, he's not a fit parent. But we can avoid all of that hurt. I went through being abused myself, walking on eggshells, getting hit because I don't like eating oatmeal from my mother's abuser. Moiralena is my heart, I'll do anything to get her back and in a safe and loving environment. I DO NOT want my daughter to ever walk down the path my mother and I have walked down. In 8 years, I will have my masters in psychology and a house in 10 years. I'm doing this not only for myself but for Moiralena who deserves everything I never had. But it's getting to that point where I might have to leave the country because I know once DSS gives me custody, he will stop at nothing to find me and control me once again. I just need help on what to do about not getting heard by DSS or a domestic violence judge. What can I do to get my daughter back where she'll be loved forever and not abused by a man who's been convicted and served prison time. I just want my child to be safe.

Ms. Michaux,

I am a domestic violence advocate and activist.  For two years I have been working with advocates in the eastern part of our State to bring accountability and justice to victims of domestic violence and to the advocates who serve them.  We have gathered boxes and file cabinets full of information concerning Options to Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, Inc. in Washington, NC.  We have researched information and "feed" the State with emails full of abuses of victims and abuses of 35 plus employees who have resigned or been fired from this program.  Emails and phone call have been made to inform the NC Office of State Auditor, the Council for Women, the Department of Administration, the Governor's Office, and the Governor's Crime Commission.  The advocates have worked tirelessly for 2 years to insure the accountability of tax payers dollars...to ensure that victims are not "managed" in a way to further victimize them and to ensure that the advocates who serve them were supported and treated with respect and dignity.  The GCC has determined that Options owes to the State $51,000 plus in monies that were not properly used and that
there was management that was far less than effective and certainly abusive and are now holding  the federal funds.  The OSA has determined that $12,000 plus was improperly used in a "review" and yet a full audit has not been done.  Now the CFW has determined that they will give Options another chance and offer to refund them "with conditions".  This is extremely disturbing to these brave advocates who have stood strong and tall to "blow the whistle" on the management and board of directors of this program.  Now 35 plus of these advocates have lost their jobs only to have Options fight many of them at every turn in their efforts to draw unemployment in hearings where they were falsely accused and degraded.  They now face the reality that they will never be able to do the work they love so well....to advocate for and assist victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.   The president of Options Board of Directors, Delma Blinson ( a contributing editor to the Beaufort Observer) has disparaged these employees and the husband of the Executive Director, Jay Niver, (editor of the Beaufort Observer) has threatened some of them personally and disparaged them in the Beaufort Observer.  (We have copies of his articles and emails)  There are serious issues as to conflicts of interest in board members and some months ago a list of board members resigned after finding issues that were not being addressed.  After all this...the CFW is giving Options "a second chance" rather than thinking outside the box on what changes would best serve the victims in the five county area that Options was supposed to serve....example, individual programs for each county.  We have worked on a possible solution for this problem and would be happy to share it with you, if you are interested.

Now that the GCC now controls the federal funds and the CFW controls the state funds, there is not even a small glimmer of light of any kind of collaborative effort by the CFW with the GCC to stand firm and work together on alternative possibilities for these five counties.  Ms. Michaux, many of us are not college educated as some of the state funders are, but even we can see that the path that the CFW is now taking is a hard slap in the face to the victims and to the advocates.  The vision and understanding of what is needed in these five counties is very clear to us.  We have now formed an organization to continue our goal of bringing accountability not only to Options but to all victims and advocates across our state and will share this information with the media in order for the advocates and victims to be aware of its existence.  The CFW has disregarded our 2 years of work but I want to make it clear that "Advocates for Accountability" will move forward.  We are in the process of creating a web site and newsletter to give advocates and victims a voice...a confidential voice...so that the advocates will not be in jeopardy of losing their jobs as so many Options advocates did and that the victims do not suffer threats of retribution.  We will be requesting more information from the Department of Administration and the GCC as to the status and accountability of Options but also we will be addressing the needs and problems of all victims and advocates across our state. 

Our mission and hope is that we can make a difference in the lives of victims and insure that the State will no longer stand by and allow dedicated and well trained advocates to be treated with disrespect and abused
and that victims are not further abused by programs that have no calling to insure a "grassroots" approach to help them.  We need to see that the State protects the advocates and supports them in their work to stop domestic violence and sexual assault and that the State assures tax paying citizens that their tax dollars are being used as intended. Below is a list of abuses that have occurred by this agency.  I have removed the names of the contributors since some of them are former victims.  We would be happy to meet with you and bring the information we have gather over this 2 year period.

Staff persons suffering ton of outrage from Lee anne to the advocates which included yelling, stomping of feet, in your face, throwing papers on the floor, and threats to have Jay write articles in the paper that would keep an advocate from ever working again in Beaufort County.

"Few are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their society.  Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence.  Yet it is the one essential, vital quality for those who seek to change a world that yields most painfully to change. Each time a person stands up for an idea, or acts to improve the lot of  others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance."   --Robert F.

They’ll just need to monitor bids to see if the state needs workers for a job in which they might qualify. Since he is registered, he should already know that.

                        A user with email address of floproductsinc@bellsouth.net submitted the following question. 



                        Dear Governor Perdue,



As our economy slows and we are all looking for ways to cut expenses and I hear your advertisement about the hole in our budget, Flo-Products, Inc. would like to help the State of North Carolina save money.  Flo-Products, Inc. is an industrial valve repair service located in Greensboro, NC.  We are registered with the NC Eprocurement system.  We can actually repair a valve for 1/2 the cost of a new one, which is an immediate 50% savings to the State of North Carolina.    Repaired valves are as good or better than new in most cases.  Where are valves in the State of North Carolina?  There are valves in the state supported universities, the prisons, some of the State buildings that have boiler systems, just to name a few.  I have sent our information to all of the universities, and prisons in the past.  I need your help in changing "mind sets".  Employees tend to do "what is easiest", like buying new.  Let's instill the idea of saving the State of North Carolina money by "repairing" vs. "buying new".  I will be glad to come and sit down and discuss our services with the folks that would make these major decisions and/or refer me to the powers that be. I invite you to visit our website, www.flo-productsinc.com for more detailed information about our service.  I can be reached at the numbers or e-mail below.



Thank you for your consideration in this matter and I look forward to hearing from you.



Respectfully,



Nancy Munday

Flo-Products, Inc.

Now that the GCC now controls the federal funds and the CFW controls the state funds, there is not even a small glimmer of light of any kind of collaborative effort by the CFW with the GCC to stand firm and work together on alternative possibilities for these five counties.  Ms. Michaux, many of us are not college educated as some of the state funders are, but even we can see that the path that the CFW is now taking is a hard slap in the face to the victims and to the advocates.  The vision and understanding of what is needed in these five counties is very clear to us.  We have now formed an organization to continue our goal of bringing accountability not only to Options but to all victims and advocates across our state and will share this information with the media in order for the advocates and victims to be aware of its existence.  The CFW has disregarded our 2 years of work but I want to make it clear that "Advocates for Accountability" will move forward.  We are in the process of creating a web site and newsletter to give advocates and victims a voice...a confidential voice...so that the advocates will not be in jeopardy of losing their jobs as so many Options advocates did and that the victims do not suffer threats of retribution.  We will be requesting more information from the Department of Administration and the GCC as to the status and accountability of Options but also we will be addressing the needs and problems of all victims and advocates across our state. 



Our mission and hope is that we can make a difference in the lives of victims and insure that the State will no longer stand by and allow dedicated and well trained advocates to be treated with disrespect and abused

and that victims are not further abused by programs that have no calling to insure a "grassroots" approach to help them.  We need to see that the State protects the advocates and supports them in their work to stop domestic violence and sexual assault and that the State assures tax paying citizens that their tax dollars are being used as intended. Below is a list of abuses that have occurred by this agency.  I have removed the names of the contributors since some of them are former victims.  We would be happy to meet with you and bring the information we have gather over this 2 year period.

Fran:

Good morning. As you know, we have been dedicated to resolving the NC Council for Women/Domestic Violence Commission’s grant relationship with Options for a very long time. After Options has been reorganized, a process that is ongoing, some of the issues you reference may be addressed. We hope to have a contract fully executed soon, and I will be glad to provide a copy of it to you.

You need to address any concerns you have regarding the Governor’s Crime Commission with the GCC.

                        A user with email address of floproductsinc@bellsouth.net submitted the following question. 



                        Dear Governor Perdue,



As our economy slows and we are all looking for ways to cut expenses and I hear your advertisement about the hole in our budget, Flo-Products, Inc. would like to help the State of North Carolina save money.  Flo-Products, Inc. is an industrial valve repair service located in Greensboro, NC.  We are registered with the NC Eprocurement system.  We can actually repair a valve for 1/2 the cost of a new one, which is an immediate 50% savings to the State of North Carolina.    Repaired valves are as good or better than new in most cases.  Where are valves in the State of North Carolina?  There are valves in the state supported universities, the prisons, some of the State buildings that have boiler systems, just to name a few.  I have sent our information to all of the universities, and prisons in the past.  I need your help in changing "mind sets".  Employees tend to do "what is easiest", like buying new.  Let's instill the idea of saving the State of North Carolina money by "repairing" vs. "buying new".  I will be glad to come and sit down and discuss our services with the folks that would make these major decisions and/or refer me to the powers that be. I invite you to visit our website, www.flo-productsinc.com for more detailed information about our service.  I can be reached at the numbers or e-mail below.



Thank you for your consideration in this matter and I look forward to hearing from you.



Respectfully,



Nancy Munday

Ms. Lucas,

Yet again I find myself being informed about issues concerning the funding of Options in the local news paper.  I am very upset that the DOA is not forthcoming with this information...even when it was promised to me in your email below.  (see in red).  I frankly do not understand the DOA's position on releasing information when it has been requested time and again.  The letter you sent to Mr. Midyette from Ms. Chilton to Delma Blinson was dated February 6, 2009 and yet you indicated to me in emails as late as February 11 that nothing had changed.  This lack of attention to the Sunshine Act and Freedom of Information Act gives one pause to wonder why this information is being withheld. (Below is the article from the Washington Daily News...quoting you.)

Sincerely,
Fran Bumgarner

Contract is
good through
end of March
By TED STRONG
Staff Writer
A state agency has resumed
funding an organization that
helps battered women.
Options to Domestic Violence
and Sexual Assault
agreed to a contract that
allows it to receive a little
more than $62,000 to allow it
to operate through the end of
March.
â€œItâ€™s very good news for all
concerned that the funding
will be available to help the
local organization provide
vital services to victims in
the five-county area,â€ said Jill
Lucas, spokeswoman for the
N.C. Department of Administration,
which released the
funding.
Options serves Beaufort,
Hyde, Martin, Tyrrell and
Washington counties. It
shelters abused women and
provides court-advocacy services,
among other things. Its
funding had been suspended
because the state said it had to
pay back more than $50,000 in
grant funds from the previous
fiscal year.
To get state funds again,
Options agreed to several
conditions. Among them is a
requirement for Options to
implement a repayment plan
for about $12,000 in questionable
expenses found by the
Office of the State Auditor.
Repaying the $50,000 that
the N.C. Governorâ€™s Crime
Commission, which supervised
state-provided funding
in the past fiscal year,
says Options owes the state
wasnâ€™t a requirement. But
that doesnâ€™t mean the GCC is
letting go of its claim on that
money.funds are still owed to the
state,â€ said Jon Williams, acting
executive director of the
commission.
Options must find a new
executive director, board
members from each county
the group serves and establish
better internal financial controls,
which Options is doing.
Options hired Carol Williams,
a former city of Washington
finance director, as its
finance director.
â€œWe want to see a strong
management team in place to
address the problems â€¦ the
auditorâ€™s office found,â€ said
Jon Williams, who didnâ€™t rule
out his commission providing
funds for Options in the
future.
A large federal grant that
initially went to Options was
discontinued while its state
funding was suspended.
Optionsâ€™ funding problems
forced surrounding and
similar battered-womenâ€™s
advocacy groups to provide
services and programs in the
five-county area served by
Options.
Trent Tetterton, Optionsâ€™
spokesman, couldnâ€™t be
reached Wednesday afternoo

"Few are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their society.  Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence.  Yet it is the one essential, vital quality for those who seek to change a world that yields most painfully to change. Each time a person stands up for an idea, or acts to improve the lot of  others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance."   --Robert F. Kennedy, South Africa, 1966

> I am a domestic violence advocate and activist.  For two years I have been working with advocates in the eastern part of our State to bring accountability and justice to victims of domestic violence and to the advocates who serve them.  We have gathered boxes and file cabinets full of information concerning Options to Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, Inc. in Washington, NC.  We have researched information and "feed" the State with emails full of abuses of victims and abuses of 35 plus employees who have resigned or been fired from this program.  Emails and phone call have been made to inform the NC Office of State Auditor, the Council for Women, the Department of Administration, the Governor's Office, and the Governor's Crime Commission.  The advocates have worked tirelessly for 2 years to insure the accountability of tax payers dollars...to ensure that victims are not "managed" in a way to further victimize them and to ensure that the advocates who serve them were supported and treated with respect and dignity.  The GCC has determined that Options owes to the State $51,000 plus in monies that were not properly used and that

> there was management that was far less than effective and certainly abusive and are now holding  the federal funds.  The OSA has determined that $12,000 plus was improperly used in a "review" and yet a full audit has not been done.  Now the CFW has determined that they will give Options another chance and offer to refund them "with conditions".  This is extremely disturbing to these brave advocates who have stood strong and tall to "blow the whistle" on the management and board of directors of this program.  Now 35 plus of these advocates have lost their jobs only to have Options fight many of them at every turn in their efforts to draw unemployment in hearings where they were falsely accused and degraded.  They now face the reality that they will never be able to do the work they love so well....to advocate for and assist victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.   The president of Options Board of Directors, Delma Blinson ( a contributing editor to the Beaufort Observer) has disparaged these employees and the husband of the Executive Director, Jay Niver, (editor of the Beaufort Observer) has threatened some of them personally and disparaged them in the Beaufort Observer.  (We have copies of his articles and emails)  There are serious issues as to conflicts of interest in board members and some months ago a list of board members resigned after finding issues that were not being addressed.  After all this...the CFW is giving Options "a second chance" rather than thinking outside the box on what changes would best serve the victims in the five county area that Options was supposed to serve....example, individual programs for each county.  We have worked on a possible solution for this problem and would be happy to share it with you, if you are interested.

>  

> Now that the GCC now controls the federal funds and the CFW controls the state funds, there is not even a small glimmer of light of any kind of collaborative effort by the CFW with the GCC to stand firm and work together on alternative possibilities for these five counties.  Ms. Michaux, many of us are not college educated as some of the state funders are, but even we can see that the path that the CFW is now taking is a hard slap in the face to the victims and to the advocates.  The vision and understanding of what is needed in these five counties is very clear to us.  We have now formed an organization to continue our goal of bringing accountability not only to Options but to all victims and advocates across our state and will share this information with the media in order for the advocates and victims to be aware of its existence.  The CFW has disregarded our 2 years of work but I want to make it clear that "Advocates for Accountability" will move forward.  We are in the process of creating a web site and newsletter to give advocates and victims a voice...a confidential voice...so that the advocates will not be in jeopardy of losing their jobs as so many Options advocates did and that the victims do not suffer threats of retribution.  We will be requesting more information from the Department of Administration and the GCC as to the status and accountability of Options but also we will be addressing the needs and problems of all victims and advocates across our state.

Ms. Lucas,



Yet again I find myself being informed about issues concerning the funding of Options in the local news paper.  I am very upset that the DOA is not forthcoming with this information...even when it was promised to me in your email below.  (see in red).  I frankly do not understand the DOA's position on releasing information when it has been requested time and again.  The letter you sent to Mr. Midyette from Ms. Chilton to Delma Blinson was dated February 6, 2009 and yet you indicated to me in emails as late as February 11 that nothing had changed.  This lack of attention to the Sunshine Act and Freedom of Information Act gives one pause to wonder why this information is being withheld. (Below is the article from the Washington Daily News...quoting you.)



Sincerely,

Fran Bumgarner

Contract is
good through
end of March
By TED STRONG
Staff Writer
A state agency has resumed
funding an organization that
helps battered women.
Options to Domestic Violence
and Sexual Assault
agreed to a contract that
allows it to receive a little
more than $62,000 to allow it
to operate through the end of
March.
“It’s very good news for all
concerned that the funding
will be available to help the
local organization provide
vital services to victims in
the five-county area,” said Jill
Lucas, spokeswoman for the
N.C. Department of Administration,
which released the
funding.
Options serves Beaufort,
Hyde, Martin, Tyrrell and
Washington counties. It
shelters abused women and
provides court-advocacy services,
among other things. Its
funding had been suspended
because the state said it had to
pay back more than $50,000 in
grant funds from the previous
fiscal year.
To get state funds again,
Options agreed to several
conditions. Among them is a
requirement for Options to
implement a repayment plan
for about $12,000 in questionable
expenses found by the
Office of the State Auditor.
Repaying the $50,000 that
the N.C. Governor’s Crime
Commission, which supervised
state-provided funding
in the past fiscal year,
says Options owes the state
wasn’t a requirement. But
that doesn’t mean the GCC is
letting go of its claim on that
money.funds are still owed to the
state,” said Jon Williams, acting
executive director of the
commission.
Options must find a new
executive director, board
members from each county
the group serves and establish
better internal financial controls,
which Options is doing.
Options hired Carol Williams,
a former city of Washington
finance director, as its
finance director.
“We want to see a strong
management team in place to
address the problems … the
auditor’s office found,” said
Jon Williams, who didn’t rule
out his commission providing
funds for Options in the
future.
A large federal grant that
initially went to Options was
discontinued while its state
funding was suspended.
Options’ funding problems
forced surrounding and
similar battered-women’s
advocacy groups to provide
services and programs in the
five-county area served by
Options.
Trent Tetterton, Options’
spokesman, couldn’t be
reached Wednesday afternoo

Please note my responses to Answers that I requested from Jill Lucas are in RED  ! Jill's responses to my questions are in Blue.
I appreciate Jill's prompt responses but feel that the CFW has ignored serious issues and outstanding compliants that not only effect those making the allegations but may interfere with victim services as well.  - Thank you for your consideration in these matters - Ann
Ann:
Sorry for the delay. Note responses to your questions below.

Note that my email was changed a few months ago to <mailto:jill.lucas@doa.nc.gov>jill.lucas@doa.nc.gov. You might want to update your address book as the “ncmail” address will stop working at some point.




1)  Mel Chilton has advised Options to hire new Executive Director - Does the Executive Director have to be in place before the $62,112.96 allocated is paid Options?

---
An Interim Director is working at Options now. A search committee has been formed and the position will be advertised.    Does the DOA/ CFW find it reasonable to hire an Executive Director by the end of this new contract, March 31, 2009 ?   I am well aware that the $62,112.96 has been allocated with no regard to Options' continuing to be in violation of its policies and procedures !   Additionally what experience does the interim director have in managing a DV/SA agency ?   Tax paying citizens have every right to information concerning such violations ! 

2) Will Options be required to adhere to Grant Budget Line Items in the spending of this $62,112.96 ?

Yes. A contract has been executed and 3rd quarter funds have been provided.

I have reviewed the budgets that have been submitted by Options and find no justification descriptions on the budgeted line items. I also noted that Options' submitted outdated by-laws and an incomplete Board Listing as no emails were provided for Board Members. I also noted that the SA grant submittal budgeted over $4,000 for the Executive Director (1 month period) but the job description attached was for a Sexual Assault Response & Prevention Coordinator.   I also noted that shelter staff were not included in any of the submitted budgets. 

3) Will Options be allowed to pay late/overdue bills with this $62,112.96 ?

You will need to contact Options about this. We currently are working with 3rd quarter funding only. Grant Guidelines stipulate that debt payments, fines and penalties are unallowable.The $62,112.96 is allocated from your agency and it is your agency's responsibility to see that guidelines are adhered to.   (Either you will allow them to use this money for late/overdue bills or you won't)

4)  Will Options be allowed to pay back unpaid wages with this $62,112.96 ?

Again, you need to contact Options. You might want to try Wayland Sermons or Dr. Delma Blinson.

5)  Will Options' be allowed to to pay unpaid thrift store personnel wages with this $62,112.96 ?


The budget is worked out to pay existing staff. Contact Options for details. Budget stipulations that salary must relate directly to the execution of proposed services.  Thrift Store Workers do not provide basic/direct services to victims and are not trained to do so.   2 thrift store workers are budgeted in each of the DV grants that have been submitted to you.  Adhering to grant guidelines and how these funds are dispersed should be the CFW's responsibility.   Furthermore it is a well known fact that Options' will not respond to me at all as I have several outstanding grievances with them that have yet to be heard. 

6) Mel Chilton advised that Options have legal representation as this is not required in grant grant guidelines; what is the purpose behind this requirement ?


It was a requirement in order to restore funding.  Wayland Sermons is Options' long-time Attorney and is now listed as a Board Member.   Mr. Sermons was in place prior to funding cuts as Options' Attorney. I doubt that Mr. Sermons will correspond with me and  Dr. Delma Blinson refuses to speak with me at all.   I have submitted several requests to Mr. Sermons in regards to my final paycheck from Options' being held since August 2008 and have yet to receive any response form him.



7) Per Grant Guidelines the Displaced Homemaker Position is limited in job responsibility duties; Is this position being
or will this position be monitored to ensure that the Displaced Homemaker is providing direct services to this population only
and not sharing other positions within Options such as supervising thrift stores, helping manage the shelter, answering the phones and etc. ?
The position currently is not filled but duties will be defined and monitored by Options’ director.

It was noted that Marisol Barr was Options' Displaced Coordinator although I have not been informed as to Options' receiving funding for this program as of yet.   


8)  Please include justification of the requirement for Options to establish internal controls, review by-laws and policy and

procedures when the Audit REVIEW clearly stated that Options' policies were fine but that THEY (Options) JUST NEEDED TO FOLLOW THEM .


OSA cited Options for lack of internal controls. The new contract addresses this matter specifically.   OSA cited that Options' policies were fine - that Options' just needed to follow them.   Grant Agreement Stipulates Compliance with Applicable Laws - "The Grantee shall comply with all laws, ordinances, codes, rules, regulations, and licensing requirements that are applicable to the conduct of its business, including those of federal, state, and local agencies having jurisdiction and/or authority".

9) Mel Chilton has advised Options to set a repayment plan for the unallowable cost in noted in the OSA review whereas the State Auditor requested that the funding agencies should carefully review the findings in Table 1 to determine whether any of the questioned expenditures have been reimbursed Options and whet er they should be recouped by the funding agency.  This needs clarification as to exactly how much of the unallowable costs in Table 1 of the Audit Review were charged to CFW funds and how much of the unallowable costs were charged to the GCC funds.   In other words, the entire questionable amount in Table 1 of the Audit Review may not be owed entirely to the CFW.  Just how much is owed CFW ?

Options has agreed to a repayment plan, however the details are not yet final. We are working together to determine the exact amount of funds to be repaid.   And to whom as some of the findings in Table 1 were probably charged to DV money and the GCC was in charge of this money.

Ms. Chilton, Thank You for your prompt response.  However, for your information, I followed Options' policy and procedure in reporting issues relating to discrimination, harassment, and breach of confidentiality to Lee anne Hanson.  First, I went to her in person, and was "brushed off", second I went to Vivian Visco who was concerned enough to act, Third, I had to rewrite my grievance to satisfy Dr. Delma Blinson.   Fourth, I was intimidated and harassed by Dr. Blinson via email in regards to my grievances and finally told by him that I must have an attorney; Dr. Blinson will no longer communicate with me at all, saying that he will only talk to my attorney. 

Per your suggestions, it has been a waste of time in reporting to the ESC or NCDOL as they to don't appear to care about these violations and furthermore view the employer's justifications as the truth!   If your agency requires that Options have policy and procedures and you do not care if they are enforced then again, I ask you, which state agency does care as this appears to be a serious double-standard.

I will not be "bullied" into backing down as my complaints are legitimate.   Any dedicated professional should realize that these violations are serious and could negatively effect client services as well.    If you allow agencies to disregard policy and procedures; then you can only be "setting the stage" for serious program liabilities to occur, as well, wasting tax payer's money in agencies having to write and distribute these policies.  

Best Wishes,

Brandy Bishop


PS  So, if the NCCFW/DVC would not be the appropriate agency to air my personnel issues, which agency does a tax paying citizen report Options' non-compliance to policy and procedures to?    And, thus it would appear that you are telling me that per the last investigation of Options in relation to me, was a violation of your agency policy?

Address: 15 Winter Woods Drive, Louisburg, NC 27549

Email: rodcague@hotmail.com

Subject: Suggestion to save money

Comment: I would hope one of your areas you are looking to cut spending is the use of State owned vehicles. I have seen a high abuse of State vehicles at local restaurants in the Raleigh and Wake Forest area around my residence and local travels. These cars appear to be used to go to second jobs or personal running of errands. If you would like I will provide tag numbers of the vehicles in the future. With the State trying to save as much money as possible I think most of the fleet could be left in a DOT lot and employees can use their own vehicles to get to and from work like the rest of us have to and if these vehicle are needed to go home I would hope that the employee is charged for the mileage from home to the first visit of the day and from the last visit back to their home. These should fall under the same policy that all other sales people have to follow for mileage reimbursements from their employers and allowed by the Government. Thank you for your time

	Mrs. Lucas.  You're right, I have questioned the CFW repetitively concerning the Hyde county office location, and repetitively I have been ignored and have yet to receive an answer. You are also wrong about my question being addressed by Options. They are spending the grant money, not supplying it. My concerns lie with the funding and tracking of these funds. I have the grant applications and expense reports for the past two years. I know for a fact that the CFW funded Options for the Hyde county office when in fact they had no office. The office location was a requirement for grant funding. No office, no funding. Simple as that. Why is it that the CFW funded this office knowing there was no office at this location? If you think I'm irritated about this then you're right. The lack of oversight of grant funding has cost me nearly $5000.00. I know you couldn't care less. I know not one soul within the Dept. of Administration gives a damn either. That's a problem. You're spending my tax dollars without regard to accountability. Mrs. Chilton has had opportunity to answer my questions but chose not to back in Aug. '08. I'm not going to waste my time and money on a trip to Raleigh when I know the outcome already. Here's what I'm going to do. I'll give you the answers to the questions I've been asking. (1) What was the location of the Hyde county Options office from 12/06 through 11/07? Answer: The office was located at 34830 US HWY 264 Engelhard NC. Residence of Andy Midyette. Violation of grant guidelines, (a residence cannot be considered an office)(2) Where was the office located from 12/07 through 5/08? Answer: No Hyde county office for this period. Previous Options office 51 Main St. Swan Quarter was rented for a couple of weeks during 5/08 but was not used. (Violation of grant guidelines. SHALL have an office location) (3) Where is the office located at present? You figure it out. I'ts YOUR JOB. Over $100k in funding for an office that didn't exist. It was easy to answer these questions because I took the time to look into it. Something the CFW or DOA is not capable of doing. I will continue to request information concerning the funding of this location. I have a right as a citizen and a taxpayer to know how my tax dollars are accounted for. YOU have an obligation to the taxpayers to provide information they ask for concerning tax dollar accountability. When Options monthly cost reports arrive at the CFW I will be looking for copies shortly thereafter in the mail. Please advise if you have no intention of honoring my public records request. Thank you for you time. Andy Midyette

Ms.Lucas,

Thank you for your letter in your email of March 17, 2009.  I am responding to this letter and email by this email and by copy which will be forwarded by U.S. Mail. 

First of all, some members of the Advocates for Accountability have been requesting information from the State of North Carolina for 24 months now....not 12 months.  Our requests for information and information we have provided have been directed to Mel Chilton, Robin Colbert, Britt Cobb, McKinley Wooten, June Michaux, David Jones, Barry Bryant, Julia Jarema, the OSA by way of the OSA Hotline and staff, Senator Marc Basnight, the Governor's Office (to Gov. Easley and now to Gov. Perdue), the Washington Daily News in Washington, NC, WNCT in Greenville, NC, WITN in Washington, NC, the News and Observer in Raleigh, NC and, of course to you.  I personally met with Ms. Chilton and Ms. Colbert over a year ago and some of the members of the Advocates for Accountability met with Ms. Chilton, Mr. Wooten, Ms. Parker, Mr. Jones, Mr. Bryant, and Mr. Walters in August, 2008.  We have sent literally "mountains" of information about abuses of victims, abuses of funding, and abuses of advocates to all persons mentioned above.  We now have boxes and boxes of information we have gathered over this two year period and emails we have sent and received regarding information to and from all these State offices and media entities.   During this 2 year period, we have worked tirelessly to inform the State of misuse of taxpayer dollars, complete and flagrant disregard for grant guidelines, terrible atrocities of treatment of domestic violence victims, and the worst record of the treatment and retention of dedicated advocates I have ever heard of in my years of advocacy.  My personal agenda has been and will continue to be to see that the victims of domestic violence and sexual assault in our state receive the best help there is available to allow them to rebuild their lives without fear or abuse and for the advocates that serve them to be treated with the respect and dignity they so very much deserve. It is not just Options that is my main focus...Option is simply symptomatic of the failure of the system that is unwilling to hear the problems of the victims and of the advocates and a system that is not willing to stand up for substantial accountability for services and the use of the citizens dollars.  In my opinion, Options certainly qualifies for a category of the "worst possible kind" and there lies my determination that the State become aware that they must begin to listen to the victims, the advocates, and the citizens of NC to take action and to think outside the box on how to assure accountability for the funding of this very important issue. 

As far as your willingness to continue to provide all public records we request, we assert that this is our right as citizens of NC and will continue to request information that we deem pertinent to our agenda.  In your letter you indicate that you will be unable to respond to questions which you deem to be repetitive and redundant.  It is my understand that under the Freedom of Information Act, Sunshine Law and the Governor's Executive Order #4 that all government business and records will be available to the citizens of NC.  If some of our requests seem repetitive to you, it is because we have not received a direct and complete answer to our questions and are continually referred to Options for a response.  You also indicate in your letter that we should address these questions to Options or other entities.  First of all, our questions are not directed to Options but to the CFW and their requirements and agenda concerning funding accountability.   Secondly, you indicated that we might address these questions to "other entities"...what other entities within the NC government do you suggest we direct them to?  In order to get direct and full disclosure to our inquiries, we would be happy to contact these other entities you refer to.  We learned about the availability of information under the Freedom of Information Act by the release of a substantial amount of our information to Jay Niver, husband of Leanne Hanson-Niver and editor of the Beaufort Observer well over a year ago.  We fought long and hard to have the State to keep this information confidential but to no avail and now our inquiries are being labeled repetitive and redundant.   It is thanks to Mr. Niver that we became aware of our right to information concerning government business and requirements.  Without his inquiry, we would have never been educated to our rights as to the availability of all information. 

As far as meeting with Ms. Chilton on March 30th, we have already met with her, Ms. Lucas, and Mr. Wooten with no substantial result.  Unless Ms. Chilton is willing to provide answers to questions that we have already submitted, I see no reason for the advocates living in the eastern part of our state to make a trip to Raleigh for an hour meeting without the assurance that the questions we have posed to Ms. Chilton and the other CFW officials will be fully answered as requested.  Also we want the answers to these question, however redundant or repetitive, to be answered in writing. 

In my email to you dated 3/13/09 (which I am also sending in the letter by U.S. Mail), I have asked questions which to date have not been responded to.  If these questions are the ones which you consider redundant and repetitive, are you indicating that neither you nor the CFW will be able to respond?   Again, these questions are directed to the CFW, not to Options, and how the CFW will oversee funding (taxpayer dollars)  they determined that the State will provide to Options and the requirements for the funding.  See the questions in my email to you below:

I hope that further inquiries made by the Advocates for Accountability will not be met with any reluctance for full and complete disclosure of the CFW's requirements for strong accountability of State funds. 

Sincerely,

Fran Bumgarner
Domestic Violence Advocate and Activist

_________________________________________________________________________________________

Ms. Lucas:

I have the following questions under the Freedom of Information Act and Sunshine Law:

What is the CFW basing the refunding of Options on?  Is it based on a new application or on the application submitted in the spring of 2008?

Has Options submitted a new list of Board Members, a list of present staff, and documentation of the training of present staff?   If so, I would like to have a copy of this information.

Will Options be required to adhere to Grant Budget Line Items and will the CFW be monitoring the spending of the $62,112.96?  Specifically, who will be monitoring the spending by Options of the $62,112.96?

Will Options be allowed to pay late/overdue bills with the $62,112.96?  Will the CFW not have any input into how these funds will be used and will Options have to submit monthly reports with proof of payment to justify the use of the $62,112.96? 

Why would we have to contact Options ( Wayland Sermons or Delma Blinson) as to the question if the funds would be allowed for unpaid back wages?   Again, does the CFW have no say as to how these funds will be used?
Do the grants allow for paying unpaid wages for services which may or may not have been provided.  Does Options have to submit monthly reports of services provided in order to justify the use of the $62,112.96 for back wages and are they going to be allowed to pay unpaid thrift store personnel wages?  I am disturbed as to the CFWs position that we need to contact Options for how these funds will be used.  Are you saying that the CFW doesn't know or is not going to monitor how the $62,112.96 is going to be used and you are going to...again...allow them to use state funds as they see fit?

Is it a requirement for all programs to have legal representation or is the requirement by the CFW for Options to obtain representation a stipulation for Options only?   Why did the CFW determine that it should be a requirement for Options?

My question is this....will the CFW fund full time positions for advocates for each county and for the DH position, a shelter manager or will the CFW allowed these positions to be covered by one person?

Please advise of the amount of the repayment to the CFW, the source of the funds and documentation of the misuse of the funds.  Has the OSA been informed about a specific review of the determination of the questioned expenditures?  Is the OSA going to be responsible for the review or will the CFW?

Ms. Davis,
You said that she was already on the waiting list (see pasted message below from October 2008,) and we were told by Mr. Smith to get her FL2 updated and submitted quickly - now it is going to expire again in few days. I want you all know that I have been on the phone with our Repetitive Howard Coble's office this morning, I have calls into Repetitive Brad Miller's office, Governor Purdue's office as well as a local attorney.

Individuals that I have already spoken to agree that 17 months is much too long to have been waiting (17 months in Salisbury and 6 months in Fayetteville. This has been a very long 17 months of submitting information over and over, and communication issues.

Good Afternoon Ms. Parker,

I have received Ms. Parker's updated FL2, and have placed her on the waiting list for a female bed.   At present we do not have any scheduled female discharges, but I will let you know in the event one should be scheduled.

Thank you,

Ms. Parker,

I have ben in contact with Mr. Smith in regards to your mother-in-law's need for skilled placement.  Her current FL2 does appear to be at a skilled level, which would qualify her for care here as soon as a bed becomes available.  I will contact you as soon as I anticipate an opening.

One item I will need to complete her file at this facility, is a copy of her military discharge.   A copy of the discharge can be faxed to 910-822-0979.

Thank you for your assistance.

Ms.Lucas,



Thank you for your letter in your email of March 17, 2009.  I am responding to this letter and email by this email and by copy which will be forwarded by U.S. Mail. 



First of all, some members of the Advocates for Accountability have been requesting information from the State of North Carolina for 24 months now....not 12 months.  Our requests for information and information we have provided have been directed to Mel Chilton, Robin Colbert, Britt Cobb, McKinley Wooten, June Michaux, David Jones, Barry Bryant, Julia Jarema, the OSA by way of the OSA Hotline and staff, Senator Marc Basnight, the Governor's Office (to Gov. Easley and now to Gov. Perdue), the Washington Daily News in Washington, NC, WNCT in Greenville, NC, WITN in Washington, NC, the News and Observer in Raleigh, NC and, of course to you.  I personally met with Ms. Chilton and Ms. Colbert over a year ago and some of the members of the Advocates for Accountability met with Ms. Chilton, Mr. Wooten, Ms. Parker, Mr. Jones, Mr. Bryant, and Mr. Walters in August, 2008.  We have sent literally "mountains" of information about abuses of victims, abuses of funding, and abuses of advocates to all persons mentioned above.  We now have boxes and boxes of information we have gathered over this two year period and emails we have sent and received regarding information to and from all these State offices and media entities.   During this 2 year period, we have worked tirelessly to inform the State of misuse of taxpayer dollars, complete and flagrant disregard for grant guidelines, terrible atrocities of treatment of domestic violence victims, and the worst record of the treatment and retention of dedicated advocates I have ever heard of in my years of advocacy.  My personal agenda has been and will continue to be to see that the victims of domestic violence and sexual assault in our state receive the best help there is available to allow them to rebuild their lives without fear or abuse and for the advocates that serve them to be treated with the respect and dignity they so very much deserve. It is not just Options that is my main focus...Option is simply symptomatic of the failure of the system that is unwilling to hear the problems of the victims and of the advocates and a system that is not willing to stand up for substantial accountability for services and the use of the citizens dollars.  In my opinion, Options certainly qualifies for a category of the "worst possible kind" and there lies my determination that the State become aware that they must begin to listen to the victims, the advocates, and the citizens of NC to take action and to think outside the box on how to assure accountability for the funding of this very important issue. 



As far as your willingness to continue to provide all public records we request, we assert that this is our right as citizens of NC and will continue to request information that we deem pertinent to our agenda.  In your letter you indicate that you will be unable to respond to questions which you deem to be repetitive and redundant.  It is my understand that under the Freedom of Information Act, Sunshine Law and the Governor's Executive Order #4 that all government business and records will be available to the citizens of NC.  If some of our requests seem repetitive to you, it is because we have not received a direct and complete answer to our questions and are continually referred to Options for a response.  You also indicate in your letter that we should address these questions to Options or other entities.  First of all, our questions are not directed to Options but to the CFW and their requirements and agenda concerning funding accountability.   Secondly, you indicated that we might address these questions to "other entities"...what other entities within the NC government do you suggest we direct them to?  In order to get direct and full disclosure to our inquiries, we would be happy to contact these other entities you refer to.  We learned about the availability of information under the Freedom of Information Act by the release of a substantial amount of our information to Jay Niver, husband of Leanne Hanson-Niver and editor of the Beaufort Observer well over a year ago.  We fought long and hard to have the State to keep this information confidential but to no avail and now our inquiries are being labeled repetitive and redundant.   It is thanks to Mr. Niver that we became aware of our right to information concerning government business and requirements.  Without his inquiry, we would have never been educated to our rights as to the availability of all information. 



As far as meeting with Ms. Chilton on March 30th, we have already met with her, Ms. Lucas, and Mr. Wooten with no substantial result.  Unless Ms. Chilton is willing to provide answers to questions that we have already submitted, I see no reason for the advocates living in the eastern part of our state to make a trip to Raleigh for an hour meeting without the assurance that the questions we have posed to Ms. Chilton and the other CFW officials will be fully answered as requested.  Also we want the answers to these question, however redundant or repetitive, to be answered in writing. 



In my email to you dated 3/13/09 (which I am also sending in the letter by U.S. Mail), I have asked questions which to date have not been responded to.  If these questions are the ones which you consider redundant and repetitive, are you indicating that neither you nor the CFW will be able to respond?   Again, these questions are directed to the CFW, not to Options, and how the CFW will oversee funding (taxpayer dollars)  they determined that the State will provide to Options and the requirements for the funding.  See the questions in my email to you below:



I hope that further inquiries made by the Advocates for Accountability will not be met with any reluctance for full and complete disclosure of the CFW's requirements for strong accountability of State funds. 



Sincerely,



Fran Bumgarner

Domestic Violence Advocate and Activist



_________________________________________________________________________________________



Ms. Lucas:



I have the following questions under the Freedom of Information Act and Sunshine Law:



What is the CFW basing the refunding of Options on?  Is it based on a new application or on the application submitted in the spring of 2008?



Has Options submitted a new list of Board Members, a list of present staff, and documentation of the training of present staff?   If so, I would like to have a copy of this information.



Will Options be required to adhere to Grant Budget Line Items and will the CFW be monitoring the spending of the $62,112.96?  Specifically, who will be monitoring the spending by Options of the $62,112.96?



Will Options be allowed to pay late/overdue bills with the $62,112.96?  Will the CFW not have any input into how these funds will be used and will Options have to submit monthly reports with proof of payment to justify the use of the $62,112.96? 



Why would we have to contact Options ( Wayland Sermons or Delma Blinson) as to the question if the funds would be allowed for unpaid back wages?   Again, does the CFW have no say as to how these funds will be used?

Do the grants allow for paying unpaid wages for services which may or may not have been provided.  Does Options have to submit monthly reports of services provided in order to justify the use of the $62,112.96 for back wages and are they going to be allowed to pay unpaid thrift store personnel wages?  I am disturbed as to the CFWs position that we need to contact Options for how these funds will be used.  Are you saying that the CFW doesn't know or is not going to monitor how the $62,112.96 is going to be used and you are going to...again...allow them to use state funds as they see fit?

Is it a requirement for all programs to have legal representation or is the requirement by the CFW for Options to obtain representation a stipulation for Options only?   Why did the CFW determine that it should be a requirement for Options?

My question is this....will the CFW fund full time positions for advocates for each county and for the DH position, a shelter manager or will the CFW allowed these positions to be covered by one person?

Please advise of the amount of the repayment to the CFW, the source of the funds and documentation of the misuse of the funds.  Has the OSA been informed about a specific review of the determination of the questioned expenditures?  Is the OSA going to be responsible for the review or will the CFW?

"Few are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their society.  Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence.  Yet it is the one essential, vital quality for those who seek to change a world that yields most painfully to change. Each time a person stands up for an idea, or acts to improve the lot of  others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance."   --Robert F.

Mrs. Lucas.  You're right, I have questioned the CFW repetitively concerning the Hyde county office location, and repetitively I have been ignored and have yet to receive an answer. You are also wrong about my question being addressed by Options. They are spending the grant money, not supplying it. My concerns lie with the funding and tracking of these funds. I have the grant applications and expense reports for the past two years. I know for a fact that the CFW funded Options for the Hyde county office when in fact they had no office. The office location was a requirement for grant funding. No office, no funding. Simple as that. Why is it that the CFW funded this office knowing there was no office at this location? If you think I'm irritated about this then you're right. The lack of oversight of grant funding has cost me nearly $5000.00. I know you couldn't care less. I know not one soul within the Dept. of Administration gives a damn either. That's a problem. You're spending my tax dollars without regard to accountability. Mrs. Chilton has had opportunity to answer my questions but chose not to back in Aug. '08. I'm not going to waste my time and money on a trip to Raleigh when I know the outcome already. Here's what I'm going to do. I'll give you the answers to the questions I've been asking. (1) What was the location of the Hyde county Options office from 12/06 through 11/07? Answer: The office was located at 34830 US HWY 264 Engelhard NC. Residence of Andy Midyette. Violation of grant guidelines, (a residence cannot be considered an office)(2) Where was the office located from 12/07 through 5/08? Answer: No Hyde county office for this period. Previous Options office 51 Main St. Swan Quarter was rented for a couple of weeks during 5/08 but was not used. (Violation of grant guidelines. SHALL have an office location) (3) Where is the office located at present? You figure it out. I'ts YOUR JOB. Over $100k in funding for an office that didn't exist. It was easy to answer these questions because I took the time to look into it. Something the CFW or DOA is not capable of doing. I will continue to request information concerning the funding of this location. I have a right as a citizen and a taxpayer to know how my tax dollars are accounted for. YOU have an obligation to the taxpayers to provide information they ask for concerning tax dollar accountability. When Options monthly cost reports arrive at the CFW I will be looking for copies shortly thereafter in the mail. Please advise if you have no intention of honoring my public records request. Thank you for you time. Andy Midyette

Mrs. Lucas, I appreciate your giving me the opportunity to join a conferrence call with Mel Chilton. As you stated earlier, I have asked the same questions over and over again for a year or more concerning the funding of the Hyde county Options office. I have sent letters to Britt Cobb, Mel Chilton, Orace Pollard, Tim Hoegemeyer, McKinley Wooten, Leslie Parker, Jacqueline Jordan, David Jones and Barry Bryant. The only satisfactory response came from Mr. Jones and Mr. Bryant of the GCC. They listened to our complaints and found reason to with-hold funding. Of all the state agencies who have been involved with this funding situation the members of the GCC have been the only ones to take a stand. The auditors office review of Options found over $12,000.00 in mis-appropriations but were unwilling to do a full audit based on their findings. Wooten and Cobb totally ignored the situation. Parker, Chilton and Colbert dodged the issues. Now what do you think is going to be accomplished with a phone conferrence over an hour or so that hasn't already been addressed? If the officials named above could not give a straight answer for nearly 2 years, what's changed? My interest lie with the expenditures of my tax dollars and how those dollars are accounted for. It's clear to me that the DOA, CFW, and Auditors office want to sweep all this under the rug and move on. It's not that simple. I will continue to track the grant money going to Options. I have that right. I also have the right to make my findings known to the public. You (CFW/DOA) have the responsibility to furnish the information I request. If the governor was genuine in her statements of open government this will not be a problem. NC GS 132 gives the citizens a right to public information. I would think grant expenditures and supporting record would be considered public record since it's our tax dollars doing the funding. I cannot understand one thing however. The GCC with-held funding to Options due to the fact that over $52,000.00 was owed to the state. Doesn't the DOA and CFW work for the same state? If so, how can funding an agency already in arrears to the state be in good judgement?  Any way, I choose not to join in the conferrence call with Chilton as it will be a waste of my time. These issues have already cost me well more than it's been worth. I will be continuing to gather information on on the grant funding of Options. Your cooperation in complying will be appreciated. Someone needs to track tax dollar expenditures by this agency. The economy is too fragile for the state to issue grand funds and to not account for them. Andy Midyette

Over $100k in funding for an office that didn't exist. It was easy to answer these questions because I took the time to look into it. Something the CFW or DOA is not capable of doing. I will continue to request information concerning the funding of this location. I have a right as a citizen and a taxpayer to know how my tax dollars are accounted for. YOU have an obligation to the taxpayers to provide information they ask for concerning tax dollar accountability. When Options monthly cost reports arrive at the CFW I will be looking for copies shortly thereafter in the mail. Please advise if you have no intention of honoring my public records request. Thank you for you time. Andy Midyette
