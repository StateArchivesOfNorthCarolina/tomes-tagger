Subject: Save NC money and embarrassment

Comment: hundreds of thousands of dollars are being wasted in Department of Commerce. with the possibility of over $1 million by the end of this year. Some of these cost includes criminal actions taken against employees making complaints. Some of the criminal actions involve members of the Attorney General's office. Some employees may release evidence of bribes paid over the past 8 years for large incentives. The documents are hidden in state government servers. Here is a sample, businesses are required to make a "contribution" that is split in percentages. The Assisant Secretary of Administration works the financial magic through contracts and with the help of the CFO while the CIO and Deputy CIO covers the tracks (along with contractors and "trusted" employees) of electronic communications. Anyone putting the pieces together is then setup and fired. Then AG staff takes care of making sure the employee is no longer credible. Check all the former employees over the past 8 years who had "inappropriate" materials (porn etc.) on their computer etc. Then have Michael King give up other peoples' backup emails documents he has been keeping to protect himself (against Denise Sessoms orders). Last known to be in his bottom desk drawer on CD-Roms and DVD. I will make myself public if I lose my job or they are arrested.

Subject: FAIRNESS IN GOVERNMENT

Comment: 2009-01-11 Gov Purdue, May I get some help with this unfair decision? Thanks, John Radford, LSC //////////////////////////////////////////// STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS COUNTY OF JOHNSTON 06 EDC 1841 JOHN M. RADFORD, JR., Petitioner, v.NORTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, Respondent, )))))))) DECISION THIS MATTER came on for hearing before the undersigned, Joe L. Webster, Administrative Law Judge, on April 19, 2007, in Raleigh, North Carolina. APPEARANCES For Petitioner: Bradley N. Schulz Mast, Schulz, Mast, Johnson & Wells, P.A. Post Office Box 119 Smithfield, North Carolina 27577 For Respondent: Laura E. Crumpler Assistant Attorney General North Carolina Department of Justice P.O. Box 629 Raleigh, North Carolina 27602 ISSUE Whether the Respondent wrongfully denied Petitioner’s request for salary credit for “non-teaching” experience based upon his prior experience as a Revenue Officer I with the North Carolina Department of Revenue. APPLICABLE STATUTES AND RULES Official notice is taken of the following statutes and rules applicable to this case: N.C. Gen Stat. § 150B-23 N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-296 State Board of Education Policy QP-A-006 WITNESS FOR PETITIONER John M. Radford Robbie B. McLamb Lisa Beth Corser WITNESSES FOR RESPONDENT Sheila White Charles David Bennett Ellen Greaves EXHIBITS RECEIVED INTO EVIDENCE Petitioner Exhibits 1-7 were received into evidence. Respondent Exhibits 1-12 were received into evidence. BASED UPON careful consideration of the sworn testimony presented at the hearing and the entire record in this proceeding, the undersigned makes the following: FINDINGS OF FACT 1. Respondent, North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (“DPI”), is charged with the responsibility of licensing professional educators in North Carolina. 2. Teachers in North Carolina are paid on a salary schedule based upon experience level, meaning that a teacher receives a salary increase as his/her experience level increases. The salary schedule incremental increases are based upon both degree level and experience level. 3. Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-295, all teachers employed in the public schools of North Carolina must be certified, or licensed, to teach. North Carolina General Statute §115C-296(a) provides, in pertinent part, as follows: The State Board of Education shall have entire control of certifying all applicants for teaching positions in all public elementary and high schools of North Carolina; and it shall prescribe the rules and regulations for the renewal and extension of all certificates and shall determine and fix the salary for each grade and type of certificate which it authorizes. . . . N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-296(a). 4. Pursuant to its statutory authority to “determine and fix the salary for each grade and type of certificate which it authorizes,” the State Board of Education (hereinafter the “SBE”) has adopted a policy, QP-A-006, entitled “Policies related to Experience/Degree Credit for Salary Purposes.” 5. The policy recognizes that educators employed in the public schools may be awarded salary credit for past employment experience as well as for certain graduate degrees. Generally, the salary credit falls into three main categories: (1) prior experience as a teacher; (2) prior work experience that is non-teaching in nature; and (3) possession of a graduate degree. 6. Respondent employs licensure specialists to evaluate license applications and also to evaluate requests for non-teaching work experience for salary schedule purposes. 7. Licensure specialists are given a three-page policy guide and a general information guide, both of which list North Carolina State Board of Education’s policy on granting experience/degree credit for salary purposes. The documents state how salaries are calculated and who is eligible for the experience/degree credit. 8. In order to be eligible to receive credit for prior “non-teaching” work experience, the prior work experience must meet several criteria. The critical factor for deciding whether to award “non-teaching” work experience credit, however, is whether that prior work experience is “directly related” to an individual’s area of licensure and work assignment. 9. Specifically, QP-A-006 provides, in pertinent part, as follows: Non-teaching work experience shall be defined as professional work experience in public or private sectors that is directly related to an individual’s area of licensure and work assignment. State Board of Education Policy QP-A-006, section 6.20 (emphasis added). 10. Petitioner is currently employed by the Wayne County Public Schools as a Guidance Counselor under a provisional license, and only has four more courses to complete. 11. After beginning employment as a Guidance Counselor in 2005, Petitioner requested credit for past non-teaching work experience. The Local Education Authority recommended that Petitioner receive credit for 16 years. 12. Petitioner’s request for credit was initially denied by members of licensure staff at the Department of Public Instruction. The denial was based upon the Department’s determination that the prior experience was not “directly related” to Petitioner’s area of licensure and teaching assignment. 13. Following this initial denial, and pursuant to SBE Policy QP-A-006, Petitioner’s employer, Wayne County Schools, requested a review by the Experience Credit Appeals Panel. 14. The school system and Petitioner submitted further documentation in support of his request for non-teaching experience credit, including official job descriptions from his Revenue Officer I position, official job description of a school guidance counselor, and Petitioner’s own comparison of his previous job duties with the job duties of school guidance counselor. 15. According to the official job description of the Revenue Officer I, the person in that position: is responsible for resolving complex, high liability delinquent tax cases. The Revenue Officer I must possess comprehensive knowledge of all tax schedules in order to determine tax liability, secure delinquent tax returns, conduct tax investigations, and assist taxpayers with filing delinquent returns. The Revenue Officer I position plays a key role in the Department’s enforcement efforts to enhance taxpayer compliance by educating the public and collecting the State’s General Fund Revenues. 16. The job description divides the duties of the Revenue Officer I into two categories: (1) Research and Enforcement; and (2) Administration of the North Carolina Revenue Laws. 17. Research and Enforcement comprises about 90% of the duties and includes various investigative duties. Petitioner admitted on the stand that, consistent with the job description, he frequently dealt with the Department of Motor Vehicles, with lawyers and clerks of the court, with banks and bank records, and with the Employment Security Commission. Petitioner had to review court tax records and the grantor-grantee indexes in the courthouse. He stated he had to have a working knowledge of accounting concepts, business law and tax schedules. 18. In fact, Petitioner’s prior experience was deemed to be creditable towards his other license area of “business education” and “middle grades business.” The Licensure Section determined that Petitioner’s work as a Revenue Officer I was “directly related” to the area of business education, and awarded him the full 16 years’ experience credit. However, his prior experience as a Revenue Officer I, while related to business, was not related to guidance counseling and was not transferable under the State Board Policy. (“Credit for non-teaching work experience is not transferable to other licensure areas for which the experience is not relevant.” SBE Policy QP-A-006, section 6.20). 19. The purpose of the school guidance counselor, as set forth in the job description, is to “promote student success, provide preventative services, and respond to identified student needs by implementing a comprehensive school counseling program that addresses academic career, and personal/social development for all students.” 20. The school guidance counselor is responsible for interpreting student test data; assisting students in developing academic and career goals; working with parents, the community and students concerning identified concerns and needs; providing individual and group counseling; interacting and communicating with teachers, administrators, and other school personnel; adhering to relevant laws, policies, and procedures; monitoring student academic performance, behavior and attendance; and assists with appropriate intervention. 21. All of the information submitted by Petitioner in support of his request was presented to the Appeals Panel at its September 26, 2006, meeting. The Panel reviewed the material and compared the official job responsibilities of the prior work experience with the Standard Course of Study and job expectations of the position of school guidance counselor. 22. The Panel consists of professional educators, none of whom is employed by the State Board of Education or the Department of Public Instruction. The Panel was created to give another level of review in the process and specifically to permit teachers another opportunity to present information in an objective forum. The Panel is inclined to give the benefit of a doubt to teachers but nevertheless seek to award credit only within the strict letter of the State Board’s policy and to ensure consistency in the process statewide. 23. The Panel here thoroughly reviewed and considered the information submitted, and after deliberating, voted unanimously to deny Petitioner’s request. 24. Two members of the Panel testified at the hearing of this matter. Both stated that, in their opinion, the job duties of the Revenue Officer I were not sufficiently related to the job duties of school guidance counselor to award salary credit. The role of a school guidance counselor involves assessing student test data, dealing with the student’s future plans, working with parents, and assisting students with interpersonal skills. 25. While Petitioner described some job duties that involved working with taxpayers on a personal level, as Respondent’s witnesses pointed out, most employees, especially those in professional capacities, engage in some counseling. 26. Petitioner admitted on the stand that he did not deal with adolescents, did not deal with class schedules, did not deal with testing or scholarships, did not deal with teachers or principals, and was not familiar with school laws. 27. The term “directly related” as used in the State Board Policy at issue here, and as applied by DPI staff and the Panel members, is a term of art that is understood by the licensure staff, by members of the Panel, and by personnel administrators in the local school systems. 28. Licensure staff is trained on the job for six to nine months prior to being permitted to apply the policy without oversight by supervisors. The Panel members worked closely with the policy in earlier attempts to revise portions of it and have had substantial experience in applying it to real situations. The term “directly related,” sometimes used interchangeably with “directly relevant,” describes the process of comparing “what the person was doing in a verifiable way in their [sic] past . . . with the specific responsibilities and knowledge and skills that would be required to fulfill the position in public education.” 29. As stated by Dr. Ellen Greaves, a licensed attorney and educator and member of the Panel, there is no precise formula for determining whether the prior experience is “directly related” to one’s area of licensure and teaching assignment. It is a “situationally contextual understanding.” In this case, the direct relationship did not exist and the Panel voted unanimously to deny the credit. BASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact, the undersigned makes the following: CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 1. The parties are properly before the Office of Administrative Hearings. 2. Petitioner bears the burden of proving the claims alleged in the Petition by a preponderance of evidence. Peace v. Employment Sec. Comm’n., 349 N.C. 315, 507 S.E.2d 272 (1998). 3. The State Board of Education has the constitutional power “to supervise and administer the free public school system and the educational funds provided for its support.” N.C. Const. art IX, § 5. This power includes the power to “regulate the grade [and] salary . . . of teachers.” Guthrie v. Taylor, 279 N.C. 703, 709, 185 S.E.2d 193, 198 (1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 920, 32 L.Ed.2d 119 (1972). The State Board has the specific duty “to certify and regulate the grade and salary of teachers and other school employees.” N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-12(9)a; Guthrie at 711. 4. Finally, the State Board has the statutory authority to “determine and fix the salary for each grade and type of certificate which it authorizes . . . .” N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-296(a). 5. While Petitioner’s duties as a Revenue Officer I were directly related to or relevant to his former position as a business teacher, his duties as a Revenue I Officer were not directly related to or relevant to his new duties as a school Guidance Counselor. 6. In reaching this determination the court relies upon the testimony of individuals with years of experience in applying the policy and the uninterrupted interpretation of that policy over the years. This court may rely upon consistent interpretation by a State Agency of its own statutes and policies in reaching a conclusion with regard to the application of a particular policy to a given set of facts. See State v. Jones, 358 N.C. 473, 598 S.E.2d 125 (2004); Frye Regional Medical Center, Inc. v. Hunt, 350 N.C. 39, 510 S.E.2d 159 (1999). Moreover, the agency’s interpretation of its own policies is controlling unless it is plainly erroneous. Morrell v. Flaherty, 338 NC 230, 237, 449 S.E.2d 175, 179-80 (1994). 7. Petitioner has not met his burden of demonstrating that Respondent has deprived him of property or has otherwise substantially prejudiced his rights and that Respondent has: (1) Exceeded its authority; (2) Acted erroneously; (3) Failed to use proper procedure; (4) Acted arbitrarily or capriciously; or (5) Failed to act as required by law or rule. DECISION The undersigned recommends that the State Board of Education affirm the decision of the Department to deny the Petitioner the relief requested. ORDER AND NOTICE The Agency that will make the final decision in this contested case is the North Carolina State Board of Education. The Agency is required to give each party an opportunity to file exceptions to the recommended decision and to present written arguments to those in the Agency who will make the final decision. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 150-36(a). The Agency is required by N.C. Gen. Stat. § 150B-36(b) to serve a copy of the final decision on all parties and to furnish a copy to the parties’ attorney of record and to the Office of Administrative Hearings. In accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. § 150B-36 the Agency shall adopt each finding of fact contained in the Administrative Law Judge’s decision unless the finding is clearly contrary to the preponderance of the admissible evidence. For each finding of fact not adopted by the agency, the agency shall set forth separately and in detail the reasons for not adopting the finding of fact and the evidence in the record relied upon by the agency in not adopting the finding of fact. For each new finding of fact made by the agency that is not contained in the Administrative Law Judge’s decision, the agency shall set forth separately and in detail the evidence in the record relied upon by the agency in making the finding of fact.

Subject: Independent contrctors

Comment: ****IMPORTANT:**** I expect strict confidence in this matter due to possible reprecussions. I meet every afternoon for coffee and drinks with a group of 10-15 local business men. Of course, we solve all political problems on a daily basis. We discuss national, state and local news and give our opinions. We have, for the past several months been discussing deficit spending and the problems our economies are having. We have one person that boasts he is paid $400 a day as a contractor under contract with the NC State Medicare program. He is a programmer. It bothers me because he also boosts that he mostly does word puzzles and plays computer games most of his working time. He says there is nothing for him to do since the state has been trying to decide who was to get the Medicare bid. Wednesday he boasted he changed vendors and asked how much the previous vendor was paid for his services. He was shocked when he was given that dollar amount. He asked for a raise with the new vendor and was given a $12 an hour raise to over $60 and hour. ****Again, I do not want my name brought up in this matter and will refuse any questioning.**** I simply think, with the current economy, this payment to a contractor is rediculious. I am sure he isn't the only contractor making this kind of money. I can't blame him for asking this kind of money but I can blame the State of NC for paying this kind of money for a vendor/contractor when there are hundreds of out of work citizen programmers who would love to have a job with the State making, say $25/hr or $52,000 as opposed to paying a contractor $62/hr or $128,960 a year to play computer games. He also boosts that he and some of his programmer friends will probably be hired for even more money by the company who just got the Medicare contract. When asked if he doesn't owe the State his loyalty and stay on with the State he laughts and says "that's their loss".

Subject: help Stop Companies Bankrupt Disabled People

Comment: I need help! I am a 60year-old male that has been disabled since Jan. 2002.When I became disabled I worked for Federal Mogul (FM) an automotive supplier. I was the Manager of Design Engineering. I asked FM everal times for a copy of the company disability policies and procedures. After 3years they gave me a copy finally at the same time they told me that they that they had over paid me $66,497.00 this was on Jan 27,2005.They said that they were stopping all my benifits until I paid this money back. The reason that they said I was over paid this time was because I did not inform them of my Soc.Sec. acceptance letter. (I have documentation that shows I did exactly what I was directed to do.)I had to get a lawyer to get them to agree to take only half of my disability pay so that I would not loose everything. The only reason they agreed was because they knew that they should have given me my disability policy within 90days of my becomeing disabled. (NOT 3 YEARS).FM sent me and my attorney a spread sheet that stated the overpayment would be paid off in Dec. 2008. This was not the first time they told me that I was overpaid. On Feb.18,2003 they stopped my benifits until I paid them back $2,184.44. Which they said was because they paid me 65% of my pay and I was only supposed to get 60%. (I have several letters from FM that states I was to get 65%, and besides how was I to know they would not give me a copy of the policies!!) On July 6, 2005 Metlife insurance co. (in 2005 FM turned my case over to MetLife to manage) sent me a letter that stated that they had over paid me $443.56 because they thought I was to get 65% of my income. I had to pay this back to resume my one half benifit. I received a letter from Metlife that stated the overpayment would be paid off in Feb. 2009 not Dec. 2008. I started questioning this in Sep 2008 because I didn't understand why. I have paid 4.04 years as stated in the spread sheet. Then metlife said it would not be paid off until July 2009. they could not tell me why so I continued to question metlife for 4 months. They sent me from one department to another. Finally in Nov. 2008 they told me that I was paid up and would start getting my full benifit starting Nov 2008. When I didn't get my full benifit I called again. They told me Now they are going ALL THE WAY BACK TO 2002 AND TAKING ALL OF MY COST OF LIVING INCREASE THAT I HAD RECIEVED FROM SOC. SEC. and that they will continue to take out as much as they deam appropriate!! I have talked to several attorneys and they all say the the law is on the side of the large companies and it will cost me a lot of money to fight it! How Can this be allowed? I am almost bankrupt because of this. I have had to barrow money from my children to buy food and pay my bills. I have sent a 5 page letter to President Obama, I have sent letters in the past to my congressman with no responce and a letter to Senator Dole and she sent it to the Labor Board who said that they could not help. I am getting desprate and have sent it to some of the News Papers with no responce. It seems that no one cares about the disabled in this country. HOW CAN THIS INJUSTICE BE ALLOWED? PLEASE HELP ME and I know if they are doing this to me they have to be doing it to others. P.S. Ihave documentation to back up everything I am telling you. Hope to hear from you soon. Paul Goad

Subject: disable veteran

Comment: Dear Sir/ Mam, Hello my mane is Milton Cummings Jr. I am a retired disable combat veteran. I was writing because I experienced something in my life last week that other people and myself felt that was wrong. I was put into Hoke County Jail on January 12, 2009 thru January 15, 2009, because of a social worker from Hoke County Department of Social Services not doing her job. I filed a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy on June 27, 2008 witch is a consolidation of all your dept. My attorney John T. Orcutt sent the Hoke County DSS the paper work on June 29, 2008 to fill out for my back child support to get the money from my trustee. Instead of filling out the paper work Hoke County DSS took out an Order For Arrest in September 2008. Hoke County tried to make it look like I was not trying to get it caught up and not trying to pay it, but I did everything in my power to fix this. My attorney contacted Hoke County DSS numbers of times and they still never fixed it. I had to spend a week of my life in jail and lose a week of my life away from my wife, kids and I will never get it back. I suffer from PTSD, Seizure Disorder, Mood Swings, Depression, and Lumbar Spinal Condition. I take medications for all my disorders, but while I was in Hoke County Jail the nurse would not give me any of my medication she told me I had to be seen by her. With my disorders I don't like being around other people and don't like talking to new people either. The Hoke County Jail didn't listen to anything I had to say and they refused to give me my medications. I was not able to eat or drink anything the whole time I was in jail because the way my body felt without my medication my Veterans Affairs doctors have gave me. Because of me having PTSD and everything that comes with it they made me take off all my clothes and put on like a safety dress and I was not allowed socks or under ware. The first night I didn't even have a blanket it took one of the other in-mates getting a blanket for me. After that I was not given the chance to brush my teeth, to take a shower, and was not even given toilet paper to use the bathroom. Hoke County Jail also had a camera watching my 24 hours a day. By the end of my stay at Hoke County Jail my wife was calling and doing everything she could do to get this fixed but no one would listen to her either. I even took all of my paper work with me to jail to show them what action we took to fix this. On the 15th January 2009 a LT came to my sail and said I should have never been put in jail because of my Chapter 13 and in less then 10 min. he had me out of the door. He knew they were wrong for what they had done and I don't want this to happen to another veteran like it did to me. I don't thank anyone should have to stay in jail because of someone else not wanting to do there job. Thank you, Milton Cummings Jr. Retired Disable Combat Veteran

Subject: MILITARY BENIFITS

Comment: I have copied and pasted an e-mail I recieved and am trying to confirm if it is true. It is under Chapter 9, Option 96. They are trying to screw us even more. Give us a raise and take it away with the other hand. Looks like our future pres is about to put the screws to the military retirees. The veterans will be next, then the active duty military. Heads Up, The Fight For Our TriCare Heath Care... is on the front burner to be cut... We all need to get involved with this, if we don't we all will be at fault. Please read everything below. Thank you Dean and others that send me items to pass on to all of the rest of the MilVets that are on this list. Subject: FW: TriCare for Life's Future Date: Thu, 8 Jan 2009 09:14:10 -0800 To All, This is for real. The heavy assault has begun on Veterans'/Retirees' benefits to pay for other programs. The word on the street is that these indeed are a high priority of the Obama administration. The one most of interest to Retired Military is in Article 189. If approved by Congress the first assault wave would hit the beaches in 2011 and would hit hard. It would initiate cost sharing to require retirees to pay the first $525 of medical cost and 50% of the next $4,725 for a first year cost of $2,888 per person. It would be indexed to increase with inflation. A reason given for this action (for PR effect) is "overuse" by Retirees. Clyde ________________________________ For those of you who are covered by TFL you will want to pay attention to what BG Bob Clements has surfaced about the future of TFL. If you know of anyone who is Retired Military, please forward this on to them. I don't know how many of you partake of the TriCare for Life program but here is a very interesting note on the subject. Seems as though our President Elect has placed a priority on cutting it out of the budget as a means to provide funding for those things he promised during the campaign. In any case, on page 189 of the Congressional Budget Office report, see the note below on how to get to that spot, there is a strong recommendation to eventually eliminate the program as it is too expensive. I would ask that you contact your elected officials and register your strong opposition to the elimination of this program. Just another move to slight those of us who dedicated much of our adult lives to the defense of our country. Thanks for listening.

Comment: In speaking for some members of the community of Harlowe, NC, we beg for assistance in dealing with the ever growing and overwhelming problem of illegal drug use. Our church community has been in discussion and we have a strong desire to "take back" our community. The truth be known, the drug problems in and around Harlowe are bigger than the local sheriffs departments of Carteret and Craven County. We have sent an e-mail to help@drugfreenc.org but we need as much attention to this situation as possible. Please advise.

Subject: Gang Activity in African American Communities

Comment: Hello Govenor, I know that you are getting settled in, and alot of issues are hitting you hard. Govenor Perdue my name is Michael Jones, and I am an African American residing in the Apex township of Wake County. Govenor it is time that a change comes to African American Community. This change has to start by focusing on getting young men out of and helping them to avoid getting caught up in gang activity. I never knew why I moved to this area, but the other day I was a victim of crime, by a gang member. He didn't hurt anyone but he stole precious goods from my family and I. How do I respond do I press charges and have him put in jail and this will cause him to be more angry or do I seek to make a difference seek to speak purpose and destiny into the lives of these young men. Govenor I need your help I'm willing to work if I get the assets. I know that we can work together to guarantee the safety of the people of this state, and the country. Please contact me about this issue it is time for a change in the African American community. If we seek peace and pursue I believe will find it.

Subject: THE LAW!

In light of the declaration by Chatham Co commissioners, are the breaking this law by not complying? GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF NORTH CAROLINA SESSION 2007 SESSION LAW 2007-494 SENATE BILL 229 AN ACT TO DETERMINE THE RESIDENCY STATUS OF PERSONS JAILED ON FELONY OR DRIVING WHILE IMPAIRED CHARGES. The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts: SECTION 1. Chapter 162 of the General Statutes is amended by adding a new section to read: "§ 162-62. Legal status of prisoners. (a) When any person charged with a felony or an impaired driving offense is confined for any period in a county jail, local confinement facility, district confinement facility, or satellite jail/work release unit, the administrator or other person in charge of the facility shall attempt to determine if the prisoner is a legal resident of the United States by an inquiry of the prisoner, or by examination of any relevant documents, or both. (b) If the administrator or other person in charge of the facility is unable to determine if that prisoner is a legal resident or citizen of the United States or its territories, the administrator or other person in charge of the facility holding the prisoner, where possible, shall make a query through the Division of Criminal Information (DCI) system to the Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC) of Immigration and Customs Enforcement of the United States Department of Homeland Security. If the LESC determines that the prisoner has not been lawfully admitted to the United States, the United States Department of Homeland Security will have been notified of the prisoner's status and confinement at the facility by its receipt of the DCI query from the facility. (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to deny bond to a prisoner or to prevent a prisoner from being released from confinement when that prisoner is otherwise eligible for release. (d) The administrator or other person in charge of the facility shall annually report the number of queries performed under subsection (b) of this section and the results of those queries to the Governor's Crime Commission of the Department of Crime Control and Public Safety. The Governor's Crime Commission shall make the reports available to the public." Page 2 Session Law 2007-494 SL2007-0494 SECTION 2. This act becomes effective January 1, 2008.

All he is asking why TRA can't pay his unemployment if he pays for ITT.They pay if you go to a comunity tech so what would be the differance ?they wouldn't be paying for his schooling like they pay for all those that go to comunity tech.That sounds like they are helping the comunities rather than people .

Subject: An Unimagineable Story

Comment: Dear Mrs. Purdue, My name is Mary Caldwell, a neighbor of the victim of an unbelievable accident. I am desperately trying to help Tanzea first with financial needs and as much emotional support as possible. Tanzea cannot imagine how her life is possible with her new disabilities. As you read her story it is unimaginable how much worse her situation has been made by such a broken medical/legal system. Please help me tell Tanzea's story. She is lying in her hospital bed in her sister's basement and cannot remember what day was the last time she was out of that bed for anything. How is this story possible in America. This accident happened here by a careless North Carolinian driver. How can North Carolina not help her? I would like to send a petition with a picture of georgous Tanzea is. I am circulating it for donations and volunteers to nominate her for Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. An account has been set up in her name for listener's donation's to get her an accessible van. Tanzea Mahbuba is a beautiful 26 year old young woman who had everything to live for until June 12, 2008. It was that day that she was a victim of a tragic accident and an even more tragic victim of a broken system. Tanzea was sleeping in her bed at her Windsong Court Apartment in Winston-Salem, when a pick-up truck crashed into her apartment striking her in her own bed. This accident left Tanzea a high level quadriplegic. Tanzea is paralyzed below her upper chest. She can move her arms but cannot move her hands. She was self-employed and had limited insurance and the driver was also poorly insured. Her insurance company required that she be discharged after only one month of rehabilitation. She does not have respite care or nursing support. Her mother had to leave her husband to move here from Bangladesh to care for Tanzea. She is living in her sister’s house which was already crowded with their family. Tanzea is trapped in the basement literally unable to get to the main level of the house. There is no bathroom on that level and Tanzea has not been able to take a shower or bath since the accident. She is only able to take sponge baths for which her mother is responsible. Tanzea is receiving limited occupational therapy but nothing else. She has a loaner power chair, but not one prescribed to her. She does not have an accessible van. This means that Tanzea has to call the Yvette van for each of her appointments. Not yet receiving Medicaid, the van cost $100.00 out of Tanzea’s pocket. She is canceling appointments due to the cost of getting to her appointments. She has a standard mattress on her hospital bed, not the specialized mattress that is designed for spinal cord injuries. Therefore, she has developed decubitus ulcers at her pressure points, commonly known as bed sores. Most of us believe that when you are a victim of such a horrific accident that at least you will be well compensated financially. This is NOT the case for Tanzea. Her lawyers have told her that likely the settlement will not exceed $35,000.00. The settlement will likely take four years to complete and fall very short of covering the costs that she has already incurred much less any future costs which are inevitable with a spinal cord injury. Tanzea is understandably extremely depressed. Despite that, it is her responsibility to learn this broken system and advocate for herself. How can this be? In the United States of America, an innocent person is victimized by a careless driver and then again by the broken medical/legal system. This is not how we should treat any human being in her situation. She was sleeping in her bed, how much more innocent can you be? She has lost everything, and no one is responsible and no one is assigned to help make it better. If this is not enough, Tanzea cannot receive Medicaid because she is not a US citizen. The only reason that she is not already a citizen is because she cannot get to Charlotte to complete the interview and recite the oath due to her injury and severe disability. Please help her by donating money to help cover the cost of a used handicapped accessible van. A relief fund has been set up in her name at Wachovia. I will also be nominating her for an Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. I will be circulating the attached petition to show your support for Tanzea and sign up also to be a volunteer if you would like to participate in the construction of a home for her should she be chosen for the show. Tanzea is an ultimate victim and we should not turn away from her. She desperately needs everyone’s help. I believe that the only reason that she is in this situation is because our community does not know her story. I know that if everyone knew that they can help her, they would.

Subject: Upset Citizen

Comment: I wanted to voice my total disappointment in the legal system of this state. Not only have I been totally victimize by it but the people that are breaking the laws of this state are getting away with it and it severely upsets me. I rented a place in Nash county back in August 2007, did what I was supposed to do and paid my security deposit and rent. I ran into tough times like we all have and my landlord was nice enough to understand when the rent wasn't paid on time, but it was always paid and all late fees were paid. In fact I even went further and paid an additional $100.00 for the trouble that we had been. Later I found a better job, but not one close to home and with the rising gas prices I decided it was better if I found something closer to my job. I did everything by the letter of the law, I gave her 30 day notice, I paid the partial rent for the 6 days into the month since my 30 days notice would put me 6 days into the next month. I even spent an entire day on my hands and knees making sure the place I was leaving was in better condition than when I first moved into it. I wait 30 days and nothing from my previous landlord. I wait 3 more days since I gave her the keys on the 3rd of the month but paid until the 6th of the month. I got nothing from my previous landlord, so I sent a letter by email and certified mail stated I wanted the return of my security deposit. Only then did I receive a letter 3 days later that was backdated stating a list of damages on the residence. Shocked at this I looked up state law and found that she lost all rights to the deposit after 30 days so I proceeded to explain how if she didn't return my deposit I would be forced to take it to small claims court. Her response to this was filing bankruptcy. Now here I am a mother of two girls whose father fails to pay his child support and not only does North Carolina do nothing about it but Virginia, where he resides, does nothing about it. I live on a limited income and even had to borrow that security deposit from my mother to be able to acquire the place. Now I have a previous landlord that not only broke the state law by not putting it in a savings, trust or escrow (obviously since she doesn't have it), but she also fails to return it and then has it cleared by filing bankruptcy. So why should I have any faith in the justice system of this state at all? Beth Harrison

It had great potential for development as a secured research, learning, health and environmental study 'campus' with the potential for long-term residents. I saw it while living in NC in 2007. I was born in NC, and I literally cringed at the loss of such magnificient 21st century potential. All I saw were 'demolition' notices - I would have 'moved in' in a minute if the 'living quarters' had been habitable. Why didn't anyone think of going solar for those small living quarters already outfitted with in-floor hot water heat? Why didn't anyone think of keeping them small and going to a unique 21st century leading health opportunity?

Subject: NC Constitution

Comment: Article VI, Sec. 8 of the North Carolina State Constitution states: The following persons shall be disqualified for office: First, any person who shall deny the being of Almighty God. I, as well as many others, find this to be blatant discrimination against anyone that does not fall into a particular religion. Please explain how someone that denies “Almighty God” is any less qualified to hold office. This should be fixed to represent all North Carolinians regardless of religious affiliation. Brian Waite

Dear Governor:
As a follow up to my request, I'd like to share with you a bit more in detail about what is going on here in Southport, NC.

Take a look at this link to the front page story showing US Representative Mike McIntyre's recent visit to Southport, and his quote.

<http://www.stateportpilot.com/pages/home.html>http://www.stateportpilot.com/pages/home.html?<http://www.stateportpilot.com/pages/home.html>

The headlines quotes him as stating "Small business is what drives this country".... yet if you turn in the same addition of the newspaper to page 12A, you will find an article clearly reported that states if this proposed annexation takes place in Southport, that several small businesses will be forced to close down, incomes will be lost, elderly and veterans on fixed incomes will be displaced, and yet the decision is scheduled for today.

<http://ee.stateportpilot.com/edition/edition/?haspdf=1>http://ee.stateportpilot.com/edition/edition/?haspdf=1

Please read this article... and let us know what can be done to stop this.

Violation of State Law (47F & 55A) , Articles, Declaration, Bylaws, Rules of Order, Civil and Constitutional Rights In A Public Meeting.

Dear Governor Purdue:



Just as government legislators failed to regulate companies that benefited from sub-prime mortgages; the absence of a regulatory agency in our State is allowing home owner associations, their management companies, and police to abuse home owners and trample over their civil and constitutional rights.



Every since February 15, 2007 I wanted to know what my home owner’s association dues were being spent on and see proof in the form of receipts or invoices.  I wanted to see proof because budgets approved and actual expenditures reported were questionable.  I didn’t think it was unreasonable especially since I lived in the community, was a member of the association, and paid dues.  I would never see that information regardless of how much the following State laws and Association rules gave me a right to access it:     



· State of North Carolina General Statute - Chapter 47F - North Carolina Planned Community Act § 47F‑3‑118 (a)  “…shall be made reasonably available….”



· GS Article 16 - Chapter § 55A‑16‑02. Inspection of records by members.  “…A member is entitled to inspect and copy….”



· Stillwood Property Owner Association’s (POA) Declaration - Section K of Article 15 General Provisions.  “The Association shall make available for inspection upon request… Documents and the books, records and financial statements ofAssociation to Residential Owners.”



* Stillwood POA’s Bylaws § 11.1 “…which shall be open to inspection by Members…Such records shall include but not be limited to: (i) a record of all receipts and expenditures….” 


I have requested but not seen or been given access to invoices and receipts.  My request have been repeatedly ignored even though State Law, our Covenant, and Bylaws make it clear that I must be given access to it.



What board members and the associations’ management company did do is become hostile, generate false police incident reports, instruct the police to harass (witnessed);  and violate my civil and constitutional rights, even though I abided by and made requests in accordance with State Law, Covenants, By-laws, and Rules of Order. 



The main report and its attachments provide details relating to how it was done, and clearly presents in detail why we need to prevent this from happening on a larger more abusive scale, especially during a period when nationally and internationally, people are facing difficult economic times; as a result of legislators failing to regulate the people and companies that benefited from sub-prime mortgage investment tools. 



Attorneys will not represent you in such matters, especially if you don’t have money to pay up-front, at the tune of $250.00 per hour!  Further, how many people have the time to take off work, to go to court, when they’re struggling just trying to keep their job!  Under such circumstances it is the duty of State Legislators and the Federal Government to step up and protect citizens that don’t have the financial resources of a business entity.  It’s a call that needs to be heard and acted upon before it gets worst - home owners need help!

I am a concerned Anson County resident. On Wednesday, February 11th 2009, there were at least two incidences, that I am aware of, that occurred that afternoon. Two different people, at two different locations were bought into the police department for possible DWI’s. Neither one blew enough to be charged with DWI’s. Both drivers had passengers that were left on the side of the road. Also both vehicles were towed in by R&R Towing Services. The owner of this company was ugly to both of these individuals. To make this story short and to get to the point that I want the resident’s of Anson County to be aware of is this. When I asked one of the officer’s at the Police Department where to recover the vehicle, he gave me directions and made the statement that the vehicle would be okay because the owner of that company also worked for the Police Department. The owner is Robert Mims. Upon investigating this, I found out that he does currently work for the
 Wadesboro Police Department. Is it just me or is this not a conflict of interest? How many vehicles may have been towed in at the Police Department’s request that this individual/employee has benefited from. Neither one of these individuals asked for their vehicles to be towed and both had someone left on the side of the road that could have stayed with these vehicles until other arrangements were made. Furthermore, I know of incidences where people I know couldn’t get a county job because they were related to one of the employees. Now, please tell me how this is different? Is it fair for an  employee of the city/county to get its contract work?

Thanks,
Amy Whittington

Subject: Jobs and Money

Comment: My parents have raised five children and never have they had such difficult times as they have in the last 2 years. But now they are about to lose their home and there is not much I can do to help them. My dad has turned in 60-70 job applications. He was a self employed mason. A very very talented mason. But there is no work in that field now. But he can't even find any kind of job. What suggestions do you have to such a situation. A year from now will be to long to wait for our economy to strengthen. They will have nothing left in the next few months, if it continues in this mannner. What are other people doing? What is our government going to do for the lower class for those who are in poverty?

Subject: wrongly accused family members

Comment: Ms. Perdue, My name is Loretta Mayhew on Dec.27th 2008, my 2 nephews were made examples of by the Mooresville N.C. police department. The arrested my 2 nephews which by the way are brothers. They are my sisters 2 boys. One is 18 and the other is 19. They are wonderful boys.They have been charged with 14 crimes they did not commit. The family is distraught and we don't know what to do. So I decided to write you. They have been in custody for a total of 45 days. My 18 year old is missing school he is supposed to graduate this year. The 19 year old has a small child to care for he has not seen in 45 days. This is an injustice to me. They're bond is so high we, the family can not make it. We hired an attorney which cost us a total of 2500 dollars. He could'nt help them. Ms. Perdue I would ask that you would help us in this so we can get them home and start preparing for they're defense. They did not do what they are accused of doing and they should be innocent until proven guilty. The judge they stood before on Feb. 10th 2009. stated that very same thing before stating they are a danger to the community. They have never been incarcerated, and this is the first time they have been accused of something. I just don't understand, It's like they have commited murder or worst. They have been other cases that the state have allowed the accused to come home. Why not them ? Please Ms. Perdue help me bring them home.

Comment: Governor, I appreciate you reading my letter. I was wondering what you are personally doing for North Carolinians that are finacially struggling? My husband and I have 2 small children that we are trying very hard to support. It seems as though we are unable to get any assistance from the government. We continue to give our tax money to these big companies that do not forgive our debts. These big companies continue to charge late fees and raise the interest rates to an unbelievable amount. With the entire economy struggling, why are these companies not forced to be more forgiving since they are receiving our money? I am out of a job and my husbands hours have been cut in half. We are doing the best we can to provide the essentials for our children. The government has got to step in and help the middle class people out that have hit a financial disaster. Thank you for reading my letter. As a side note, I do not agree with abortion. I hope that this administration doesn't support it. Bless you, Heather Small

Comment: Why was office space leased in Charlotte? In this climate of economic turmoil and especially when NC (from the news reports anyway)is looking for ways to cut the budget, it seems like an unnecessary expense. In fact, it tells me that here we have another person in government who really does not care.

Subject: Public Assistance

Comment: Bev Perdue, I am a citizen of NC and have been most of my life. My husband and I have a small business and we require our employees to take a drug test before employment. Can you imagine the money our state could save if all the people on public assistance had to take a drug test before they received a check and food stamps from our tax dollars. The majority of this states recipients live in a nice home and drive Mercedes Benz. I see them at the grocery store and they eat better than the people that are working and struggling to keep their jobs and pay the bills. I would really like to know your oppoinion on this not one of your secretary', or staff members. Some of our employees have had their hours reduced and or laid off because of the economy. I feel like if they receive a check and help from our tax dollars than let them work for it, by cleaning our roadsides, our public buildings, anything that our tax dollars are having to pay for. Just imagine our state could save some serious money and maybe even get out of debt. Please respond to me and not one of your people. Thanks Linda Langley

Subject: Yadkin River and Alcoa license

Comment: Governor- I urge, I beg you and the State NOT to renew the license for Alcoa to manage the power systems of the Yadkin River. Even if they are found to have played no role in polluting Badin Lake, from a purely economic perspective, Alcoa no longer plays a role in providing jobs to North Carolina citizens which was the original intent of granting the license. Surely there must be some other company, Duke Energy or PSNC perhaps, that at least provides jobs to North Carolina citizens. Alcoa moved it's smelting facilities to Iceland and cost the jobs of many of our own residents. They should not be rewarded for such behavior, regardless of when it took place.

Subject: North Carolina Move Over Law

Comment: Governor Bev Perdue, I am writing to get your support for public education of the Move Over Law. On November 25, 2008 while working as a firefighter I was struck by a motorist who fail to follow the Move Over Law. I sustained major damage to my right knee, which will remove me from my normal job duties for at least nine months. After my accident three other firefighters were struck by another motorist who did not follow the Move Over Law. The public needs to be educated more about the importance of this law. I am asking for you assistance in obatining any grants that would cover such education. Also any other contacts you have that could help in this much needed project. Governor Perdue please take a moment to consider how many lives could be saved, and injuies prevented by getting the message out to the public. Thank you for your time and consideration.
