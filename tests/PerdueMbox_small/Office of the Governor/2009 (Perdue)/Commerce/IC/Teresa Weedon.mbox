Thank you Ms. Lovelace. ¬†I also received an email address for Information Specialist and I understand per the North Carolina Industrial Commission that the Defense Counsel must be advised. ¬†Accordingly I ask Information Specialists here to please ¬†advise what should happen when a first report of injury (Form 19) is filed and how I can get a copy of the form 19 on the subject.
Sincerely,
Teresa Sorella Weedon

According to your email, you received from us a copy of the information submitted electronically to the Industrial Commission‚Äîthe ‚ÄúIMAGING SYSTEM FORM 19 FOR ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED FORM 19s.‚Äù ¬†The electronic First Report of Injury (Form 19) is a series of numerical codes that is transmitted by a computer to the Industrial Commission database. ¬†After the electronic transmission is complete, the numerical codes are converted into text and the imaging system form is generated by our database and electronically placed into your file.¬† This is the only first report of injury information in your file.¬†¬†

Dear Ms. Lovelace:
¬†
I understand that the Form 19 in my case was electronically filed. ¬†Why have I not received a copy of the Form 19 submission? ¬†My understanding is that I should receive a copy based on the following taken directly from¬†the North Carolina Industrial Commission (NCIC) website:
¬†
IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR EMPLOYER
Employer must furnish a copy of this form, as completed, to the employee or the employee‚Äôs representative when submitted
to the Insurance Carrier or Claims Administrator for transmission to the Commission. Every question must be answered. This
Form 19 must be transmitted to the Commission through your insurance carrier/claims administrator, and is required by law
to be filed within 5 days after knowledge of accident. Employer must also give employee a blank Form 18.
¬†
¬†
Is my understanding correct? ¬†And if so, when will I receive the copy. ¬†I have not heard anything from the defense counsel on the subject.

Good morning, Ms. Weedon.



Deputy Commissioner Brad Houser has been assigned to hear your case in February 2009, and your case is now under his jurisdiction.† You may want to consider copying Deputy Commissioner Houser and his Legal Assistant, Debra Bell on your correspondence going forward rather than Deputy Commissioner Philip Baddour and his Legal Assistant, Sue Baird.† Deputy Commissioner Baddour is no longer involved in your case.†



In addition, I have forwarded Deputy Commissioner Houser a hard copy of your emails that I have been party to.



I hope this information is helpful.† If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.



Best regards,

Dear Ms. Weedon, I would ask that you please limit your e-mail copies to the parties involved in this case, it is inappropriate for you to continue to copy all of these folks that are not involved in the case at present, who may possibly become involved in the future.† This claims process should be as impartial as possible.† Additionally, as this case moves forward and we get into the details of the case, the only persons that should be copied on e-mails are the Deputy Commissioner (including his assistant, as permitted by the rules) and defense counsel.† If you choose to represent yourself in this matter, you are subject to the rules as any attorney would be.† Your case is presently scheduled for hearing on February 25th in front of Deputy Commissioner Brad Houser at the I.C.† I have decided to handle this case myself, you may contact me (919-716-6820) if you have any questions on your claim or on procedure in general.† With kind regards.† SPW

Dear Ms. Langdon:



Thank you for the package containing a copy of the file for I.C.

I would appreciate receiving a copy of the attached completed version of the Form 19 that NCIC assigned I.C. No. 593074 to and consolidated with my claim I.C. No.†853834.



Thank you.

Dear Ms. Patrick-Wilson:
Thank you for your email today and for the notification that you will be handling the case. ¬†It is good to have this resolved. ¬†I agree that the process should be as impartial as possible but as much as possible also not put someone without counsel at a disadvantage. ¬†I have been attempting to get information, and my understanding from the court is that I ought to copy the defense counsel, and that I may ask anyone at the North Carolina Industrial Commission for assistance (per Anne Brannen, Deputy Trial Administrator North Carolina Industrial Commission, "As far as who to copy on email correspondence, that is a matter of choice.¬† I will tell you that Deputy Commissioner Philip Baddour no longer has jurisdiction of this case, so there is no added value in continuing to copy Deputy Commissioner Baddour or his Legal Assistant, Sue Baird.¬† Much is the same with Deputy Commissioner John Schafer who manages the Industrial Commission‚Äôs mediation efforts.¬† However, this is solely your decision.").
Today is the first I hear of my case being rescheduled for hearing o n February 25th in front of Deputy Commissioner Houser. ¬†I will copy Deputy Commissioner Houser and his Legal Assistant, Debra Bell and remove Commissioner Baddour and his Legal Assistant, Sue Baird on future correspondence. ¬†However,¬†I am still missing key important information from Form 19 so if you or anyone on the distribution list can help me get this information I would appreciate it.
Sincerely,
Teresa Sorella Weedon

Thank you Ms. Lovelace. ¬†I also received an email address for Information Specialist and I understand per the North Carolina Industrial Commission that the Defense Counsel must be advised. ¬†Accordingly I ask Information Specialists here to please ¬†advise what should happen when a first report of injury (Form 19) is filed and how I can get a copy of the form 19 on the subject.

¬†
According to your email, you received from us a copy of the information submitted electronically to the Industrial Commission‚Äîthe ‚ÄúIMAGING SYSTEM FORM 19 FOR ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED FORM 19s.‚Äù ¬†The electronic First Report of Injury (Form 19) is a series of numerical codes that is transmitted by a computer to the Industrial Commission database. ¬†After the electronic transmission is complete, the numerical codes are converted into text and the imaging system form is generated by our database and electronically placed into your file.¬† This is the only first report of injury information in your file.¬†¬†
¬†
The North Carolina Industrial Commission has information specialists who are trained to give unrepresented employees, employers and carriers basic information about the¬†North Carolina¬†workers‚Äô compensation system.¬† From your emails, it appears that you are concerned that you have not received everything you should have received from defendants.¬† You may call our information specialists at 1-800-688-8349.¬† They can give you further information about what should happen when a first report of injury (Form 19) is filed and may be able to answer some of your other concerns.
¬†
Please also visit our website,¬†<http://www.comp.state.nc.us/>www.comp.state.nc.us. ¬†There are links to the North Carolina Workers‚Äô Compensation Act (WC Statute) and the Industrial Commission rules.¬†
¬†
Please contact me if you have any additional questions or concerns.

¬†
Dear Ms. Lovelace:
¬†
I understand that the Form 19 in my case was electronically filed. ¬†Why have I not received a copy of the Form 19 submission? ¬†My understanding is that I should receive a copy based on the following taken directly from¬†the North Carolina Industrial Commission (NCIC) website:
¬†
IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR EMPLOYER
Employer must furnish a copy of this form, as completed, to the employee or the employee‚Äôs representative when submitted
to the Insurance Carrier or Claims Administrator for transmission to the Commission. Every question must be answered. This
Form 19 must be transmitted to the Commission through your insurance carrier/claims administrator, and is required by law
to be filed within 5 days after knowledge of accident. Employer must also give employee a blank Form 18.
¬†
¬†
Is my understanding correct? ¬†And if so, when will I receive the copy. ¬†I have not heard anything from the defense counsel on the subject.
¬†
Sincerely,
¬†
Teresa Sorella Weedon

Ms. Weedon,
¬†
The Form 19 in your case was electronically filed, which is a permissible method of filing the First Report of Injury.¬† Forms 19 that are electronically filed appear differently than the Forms 19 available on our website.¬† Accordingly, a Form 19 similar to the Forms 19 found on the Industrial Commission website does not exist in your case.¬† Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.
