Ms. Smith,
I am sorry but the Division must follow Chapter 20 Laws when issuance is made.  Under General Statutes 20-7(f)(3) and 20-7(s) it explains that any individual requesting issuance must be able to show proof of legal residence or a document showing a legal extention to remain in the States.

Subject: Immigration

Comment: NCDMV has informed my husband that they will not renew his 10-YEAR-OLD drivers' license when it expires. The Federal government has not extended Section 245I of the Immigration law - the next step in the process for an immigrant who marries an American citizen. Although we have been married for over six years, THERE IS NO NEXT STEP IN THE PROCESS unless he travels to Costa Rica. And THERE IS NO GUARANTEE that he can return if he goes. In NC, we need to have ALL drivers licensed and insured. How are we safer with un-licensed, uninsured drivers on the road? NJ is considering legislation to change this. It won't make immigrants legal - that's a Federal law problem. But NC needs to know who's driving on our roads! I don't care if a drivers' license is just a photo ID with "UNDOCUMENTED" in bold red letters on it. At least we'd have SOMETHING to identify who's on our roads.

Cindy,
the customer was contacted and it was explained to her that she did have a lapse in coverage.  According to Progressive Insurance, she was cancelled on 10-16-08 due to non-payment.  Her new insurance carrier. Liberty Mutual advised that she started new business with them on 10-21-08 there by causing a 6 day lapse in coverage,  A letter was mailed to her informing her that she could pay the $50 civil penalty by 1-16-09 and maintain her plate.

I still believe that the State of North Carolina should review this type of situation.

The man has been married to an American citizen for over six years.
The man has paid Federal and NC income taxes.
The man could provide dozens of references from NC friends and customers.
The man has had a NC drivers license since 2000.
The man has an immigration attorney.
The man has all immigration approvals that exist at this time.

The only reason that he does not have complete documentation is because the
US Congress let Section 245I of the Immigration Law expire.

I still believe that we would be safer if ALL the drivers on NC roads were licensed and insured.

What was stated in the email is correct.  If you like, the customer can scan in color the immigration documents that they have to our Service Account at <mailto:CIV@ncdot.gov>CIV@ncdot.gov.  Tell them to add my name to the subject line along with the word Legal Presence, include contact information and the NCDL number.  I will review the documents and if there is adequate information to initiate a verification request through SAVE then I will do that.  At that point, I will be waiting for a response.  Once the response has been received, I will notify you all.  That’s the best that I can do at this time.

I still believe that the State of North Carolina should review this type of situation.

The man has been married to an American citizen for over six years.
The man has paid Federal and NC income taxes.
The man could provide dozens of references from NC friends and customers.
The man has had a NC drivers license since 2000.
The man has an immigration attorney.
The man has all immigration approvals that exist at this time.

The only reason that he does not have complete documentation is because the
US Congress let Section 245I of the Immigration Law expire.

I still believe that we would be safer if ALL the drivers on NC roads were licensed and insured.

Ms. Smith,
I am sorry but the Division must follow Chapter 20 Laws when issuance is made.  Under General Statutes 20-7(f)(3) and 20-7(s) it explains that any individual requesting issuance must be able to show proof of legal residence or a document showing a legal extention to remain in the States.

Visitor: Ms. Robin Smith

Address: 200 Brierridge Drive, Apex, NC 27502

Email: rsmithcpa@msn.com

Subject: Immigration

Comment: NCDMV has informed my husband that they will not renew his 10-YEAR-OLD drivers' license when it expires. The Federal government has not extended Section 245I of the Immigration law - the next step in the process for an immigrant who marries an American citizen. Although we have been married for over six years, THERE IS NO NEXT STEP IN THE PROCESS unless he travels to Costa Rica. And THERE IS NO GUARANTEE that he can return if he goes. In NC, we need to have ALL drivers licensed and insured. How are we safer with un-licensed, uninsured drivers on the road? NJ is considering legislation to change this. It won't make immigrants legal - that's a Federal law problem. But NC needs to know who's driving on our roads! I don't care if a drivers' license is just a photo ID with "UNDOCUMENTED" in bold red letters on it. At least we'd have SOMETHING to identify who's on our roads.

Good Afternoon all.  Have I have spoken with Mr. Frey regarding the restoration fee owed to NCDMV.  Of course he was not happy about having to pay the fine he stated he had paid it in 1995 when he cleared up the citation.  I explained to him that we did not have anything on file reflecting the fine had been paid and that the only way we could clear it up was if he had proof of a canceled check or a receipt. And unfortunately he stated he no longer had those documents.  So I assited him in contacting the Alford Business in taken care of the restoration fee and also assisted him in contacting the OHDMV to make sure they saw he was cleared with NC. I spoke with hiim last around 2:45 pm today and he was on his way to obtain his OH License.
Have a great weekend.

Hello,



Dr. Dale Frey is very angry and emotional that he had to pay $50.00 to get his driver’s license reinstated.



He has been yelling at me, but please keep in mind his wife is dying of a brain tumor and he is very emotional (so please be patient with him.)



Dr. Frey claims NC told him he had to pay in person, (hand deliver) his payment if he wanted his driver’s license reinstated.



Aren’t there any other options for payment?  Did he really need to fly to NC to get it resolved?



Anyways, he feels NC has extorted money from him.



He currently lives in OH, but his wife is receiving treatment in CA.



Dr. Dale Frey would like someone to call him at:



440-306-2338   or   440-341-3000



Thank you,





Mary Creech

After reviewing Mr. Rogers record his license was suspended on 1/25/02 until 01/25/03 for 1st offense DWI.  I also pulled the monitech report which reflected he had the device installed on 3/11/02 and deinstalled on 7/22/02.  The limited driving privilege was signed on 05/10/02.  So therefore he only got credit for the device starting on 5/10/02 until 7/22/02 which is 73 days. Based on G.S. 20-17.8(c)(1) must have device installed for 12 months.  If you have any further questions please feel free to contact me.

John Kevin Rogers

12/05/1979

Buncombe County



In 2001, at the age of 22, my fiancé John "Kevin" Rogers was cited for DUI as he was less than 2 miles from his home. His license was revoked and he was required to complete drug and alcohol abuse classes which he did in 2002.   

He then completed five of the twelve months with the interlocking device mandated by the courts, only to recently discover that the court mandated ignition interlock no longer meets the Monitech ignition interlock standard that is required by the NCDMV. 

The NCDMV is now requiring Kevin to complete the full 12 month breathalyzer 'sentence' again in order to reinstate his license. Unfortunately we are unable to afford the necessary breathalyzer equipment, so seven years later Kevin is still paying for his immature mistake. 

We are now the proud parents of a one year old son and are doing our best to live the American dream. Kevin has no prior traffic offenses and no criminal record. His inability to legally drive a vehicle is a daily struggle for our family, both practically and financially. We remain a single income family because the logistics of driving him to work and taking my son to daycare and picking them both back up again are simply impossible. Kevin is a wonderful stay at home dad, but we live in constant fear of an emergency that would require transportation. What if our son gets hurt and needs to go to the hospital while I am at work? Kevin would be unable to take him. I actually drove myself to the hospital in labor with our son because Kevin cannot legally get behind the wheel. 

We understand that nothing in life is free and that sometimes mistakes made at a young age can haunt a person for the rest of their lives. However Kevin has paid his debt to society and has complied with the court's orders to the best of his ability. All I ask is that you consider our situation and see that the punishment fits the crime.  Kevin has never once defied the law and chosen to drive despite his sentence.  We do not ask for Kevin to receive a clean slate, however we would like to have the ability for him to drive so our family may function normally. 

We appreciate any advice and assistance you can offer. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,

Sara O. Disher

Thank you for your response, I guess what I am really asking is, is there anyway to have the Monitech device option removed?  John "Kevin" Rogers has gone without getting behind the wheel of a car for over 5 years, which we find to be fulfillment of his sentence. 

I know that you probably don't want to hear a sob story, as I am assuming that everyone has one...but I really have exhausted every option that I have.  We are low income people, with a minor child, and I get so frustrated by the fact that I could provide you with stacks of proof of individuals who have had multiple DWI charges who are driving today, only because they paid to play...Is there anything else that we could do??

Also, I do not really understand the whole idea behind only giving him credit for 73 days when he had it for 143 days - and now I am being told by NC DMV that regardless of the number of days. or months he had it installed he would have to do a consecutive year....so all of the money that he paid was for nothing?  How in the world is this system supposed to rehabilitate anyone, when it hurts those who attempt to play by the rules.  How many individuals go out and hit the NC roads without a drivers license.  Kevin understand the severity of the charge, hence the reason he has not tempted fate and has voluntarily not driven. 

As a taxpayer, as a Native North Carolinian I can not stand back and what this injustice continue.  There has to be something that we are able to do!  Kevin lost a lucrative job as an Assistant Manager with Lowes, his employer for over 5 years when he turned in his Monitech - he literally is 30 years old and has nothing.  He can't go to the grocery store, or take his son to the park - we live in a rural area, and mass transit is not an option - especially with a two year old! 

I can't give up - there has to be something that can be done!  Please, any help that you can give me, or someone you can refer me to would be greatly appreciated.

>> In 2001, at the age of 22, my fiancé John "Kevin" Rogers was cited for DUI as he was less than 2 miles from his home. His license was revoked and he was required to complete drug and alcohol abuse classes which he did in 2002.   

>> He then completed five of the twelve months with the interlocking device mandated by the courts, only to recently discover that the court mandated ignition interlock no longer meets the Monitech ignition interlock standard that is required by the NCDMV. 

>> The NCDMV is now requiring Kevin to complete the full 12 month breathalyzer 'sentence' again in order to reinstate his license. Unfortunately we are unable to afford the necessary breathalyzer equipment, so seven years later Kevin is still paying for his immature mistake. 

>> We are now the proud parents of a one year old son and are doing our best to live the American dream. Kevin has no prior traffic offenses and no criminal record. His inability to legally drive a vehicle is a daily struggle for our family, both practically and financially. We remain a single income family because the logistics of driving him to work and taking my son to daycare and picking them both back up again are simply impossible. Kevin is a wonderful stay at home dad, but we live in constant fear of an emergency that would require transportation. What if our son gets hurt and needs to go to the hospital while I am at work? Kevin would be unable to take him. I actually drove myself to the hospital in labor with our son because Kevin cannot legally get behind the wheel. 

>> We understand that nothing in life is free and that sometimes mistakes made at a young age can haunt a person for the rest of their lives. However Kevin has paid his debt to society and has complied with the court's orders to the best of his ability. All I ask is that you consider our situation and see that the punishment fits the crime.  Kevin has never once defied the law and chosen to drive despite his sentence.  We do not ask for Kevin to receive a clean slate, however we would like to have the ability for him to drive so our family may function normally. 

>> We appreciate any advice and assistance you can offer. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Cindy,
the customer understands the decision that was made but he does not agree with it.  He knows he has to pay the fines, he just wants someone to know he does not agree with the current policies and procedures that are in place as it relates to Liability Insurance and the fines/penalties. 

Thanks

Following is the question just received:

Visitor: Mr. Charles Becker

Address: 1149 Sturdivant Dr., Cary, NC 27511

Email: cfbecker@yahoo.com

Subject: DMV

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue I wish to bring to your attention the situation we find ourselves in with regards to the Department of Motor Vehicles and liability insurance. On Oct. 7th of 2008 the insurance on my wife Kandi’s two cars lapsed due to a missed payment, on Oct. 14th 2008 it was reinstated (with additional costs) with a new policy when I realized what happen it has also been maintained since then. I was then informed by the DMV that I had to surrender the plates on both cars for 30 days and then pay additional fees for their return to again drive the cars. Being recent transplants we were unaware of these requirements. In as much as I am presently unemployed and need transportation for my job search and for doctor appointments due to the medical conditions of my wife (who is unable to work), son and daughter we cannot be without transportation. I contacted the DMV and requested a hearing to plead our case and was informed we would be contacted with a hearing date. We then received a letter stating that it was determined we were at fault but could avoid revocation by paying a 50 dollar fine per car. As I stated I am presently unemployed and receiving 178 dollars a week our home is in foreclosure and I was for a time in bankruptcy. I contacted the DMV again to plead hardship as the fine is more than two months insurance payments and we struggle to make those payments as is. Again my request was denied and I was ordered to pay the fines. Since I must keep the vehicles on the road I will have to pay these fines but it is quite literally taking food out of my family’s mouths. Given the economic situation the country finds itself in you need to address this situation, as I am sure I am not the only one to be in similar straits. I thank you in advance for your attention to this matter. Yours truly, Charles Becker

I talked to this customer and explained in detail the law and the division's position.  She was very unhappy with the response but understood the requirement.  We started from the beginning and talked through everything and why it is required.  I gave her an opportunity to explain everything she was going through and before we ended the call, she thanked me for taking the time to listen to her.  As I stated to the customer, there is nothing further we can do to assist.

Subject: Re: FW: FW: Rogers, John Kevin - Application for Pardon

Also, I do not really understand the whole idea behind only giving him credit for 73 days when he had it for 143 days - and now I am being told by NC DMV that regardless of the number of days. or months he had it installed he would have to do a consecutive year....so all of the money that he paid was for nothing?  How in the world is this system supposed to rehabilitate anyone, when it hurts those who attempt to play by the rules.  How many individuals go out and hit the NC roads without a drivers license.  Kevin understand the severity of the charge, hence the reason he has not tempted fate and has voluntarily not driven. 

As a taxpayer, as a Native North Carolinian I can not stand back and what this injustice continue.  There has to be something that we are able to do!  Kevin lost a lucrative job as an Assistant Manager with Lowes, his employer for over 5 years when he turned in his Monitech - he literally is 30 years old and has nothing.  He can't go to the grocery store, or take his son to the park - we live in a rural area, and mass transit is not an option - especially with a two year old! 

I can't give up - there has to be something that can be done!  Please, any help that you can give me, or someone you can refer me to would be greatly appreciated.

> Thank you for your response, I guess what I am really asking is, is there anyway to have the Monitech device option removed?  John "Kevin" Rogers has gone without getting behind the wheel of a car for over 5 years, which we find to be fulfillment of his sentence. 

I know that you probably don't want to hear a sob story, as I am assuming that everyone has one...but I really have exhausted every option that I have.  We are low income people, with a minor child, and I get so frustrated by the fact that I could provide you with stacks of proof of individuals who have had multiple DWI charges who are driving today, only because they paid to play...Is there anything else that we could do??

Good Morning everyone.  I spoke with Ms. Biagini this morning regarding her pending suspension.  She understand's that she will be going into a suspension due to the conviction of the speeding citation.  I did explain to her that she was eligible for a hearing on 3/11/09 and that she could do that hearing by mail.  I did make arrangements with her to handle her hearing and to hold her hearing on 3/11/09.  She does understand why the suspension is going to happen due to the rate of speed.
Have a great day.
Thanks,
J.S. Mitchell

Good Morning all.  I spoke with Mr. Charles Tague this morning regarding his driving record.  I explained to him that under G.S. 20-17.6  SAA&TE was required of anyone convicted of a DWI or Consuming Alcohol less thatn 21.  I also explained to him that a limited driving privilege for suspension of a dwi was only good for the time period the division suspended the license for.  I explained to him that there was no statue allowing him a privilege for any extended period the license was suspended for due not completed the SAA&TE. Mr. Tague was still not a very happy customer I continued the conversation with him for about 30 minutes trying to help him understand the laws, policy and procedure
Thanks,

If you don’t mind passing along to the DMV for response, I would greatly appreciate it!!

As always, we appreciate your service to North Carolinians!!

I would like to respond to Mrs Boyd's response.  As you can see, my lapses in insurance occurred when I had to make a choice between paying for groceries, heat, etc. Each time I was able, I immediately renewed my insurance and paid the penalty.  It is not my intention to drive without insurance, and each time my insurance lapsed, I drove only the places I absolutely had to. My lapse is so extensive this time because I am unemployed.  I am in the process of becoming a substitute teacher, but can't do so if I can't get to the schools!  I also knew there was a bounced check there that had to be taken care of, and I am in the process of sending a cashiers check for this.  If you check on my insurance before I moved to North Carolina, you will see that it was never a problem (of course I wasnt a single mom, and there were two incomes).  I moved to North Carolina to get a better education for myself and my children, not with the intention of breaking the motor vehicle laws.  I am not one who goes around breaking laws.  I am struggling to raise my children and get a better education.  I just need a break every once in a while.  If I need to turn that particular tag in, so be it, but I have to have a way to drive myself to job interviews, classes, and my children to doctor's appointments.  That's all I am saying....I just need that little bit of help.

Cindy,

Ms. Shepherd has a history since 2007 of lapsing her insurance coverage.
See History:
Lapse 1 - There was a lapse from 08/30/2007 to 10/29/2007; showing approx. 2 months lapse. File cleared by fee.
Lapse 2 - There was a lapse from 06/21/2008 to 08/14/2008; showing approx. 2 months lapse. File cleared by fee.
Lapse 3 - There was a cancellation of liability insurance by Progressive on 11/12/2008 with no reinstatement.

According to the petitioner, Darlene Shepherd, she currently has no liability coverage on her 2001 NISS.

G.S 20-309 states financial responsibility prerequisite to registration; must be maintained throughout registration period. 
A hearing is not permissible since there is no insurance being maintained on the vehicle nor can she retained plate #AUTOMKT2.

There is nothing the division can do to assist Ms. Shepherd as she continues to break the Motor Vehicle Law of knowingly driving a registered motor vehicle in the State of North Carolina without liability insurance.

Note: Darlene Shepherd also has a Bad Credit Stop for check #1025 in the amount of $62.09; written on 11/03/2008.

Subject: Single Mom

Comment: What is a single mom who is also a full time student, supposed to do. I was laid off work and let my car insurance lapse (along with other bills I have had to ignore so that I can feed my girls.) I am in the process of getting insurance back, but have to wait until I get my tax refund back. The DOT has said that I have to turn my tag in. How can I go to job interviews, doctors appointments, without my tag? I am doing everthing I can, but odds are stacked against me. I should have insurance by this Friday, but still have to get my tags back..but how do I do this.

This is the reply that Ms Charlotte Boyd, Hearing Officer replied to Ms. McCauley,

I spoke with Mrs. McCauley regarding this issue.  I asked her to verify her address to insure the address we have on file is correct and it was.  I asked her to explain the situation and she stated that her neighbor brought her the revocation letter yesterday and that is what prompted her to call.  We discussed her hearing and she stated that Officer Sanders asked her to fax the FS1 (proof of insurance) and explained to her she would receive a decision by mail.  She states she never received the decision letter but she did get the revocation letter.  She also stated that she was having issues with money.  This customer has had several lapses of coverage.  I advised her that if she was having issues receiving her mail, it would be necessary for her to contact her post master for documentation to assist in the decision to allow her to pay the overdue penalty.   She states she would contact the postmaster and have a letter faxed before a decision can be made.

Good Afternoon,

Currently, immigrants may continue to use a tax ID to obtain a duplicate license/ID card.  However, once the current document expires, the customer must prove citizenship or present legal presence documents for an issuance.  All new customers must present proof of citizenship or legal presence.

Cindy/Ms. Boyd

I have confirmation of the letter that I faxed to Ms. Boyd on the same afternoon which was 2/5/09.  Letting her know that the postmaster had gone for the day and I spoke to a Ted which stated that my regular carrier had been out for two weeks sick and that could be the problem.  He also stated that he could not fax a letter I would have to call back the next morning.  I called back the morning of the 2/6/09 and spoke to the postmaster and he said that he's aware of a problem now and he could not fax anything because he don't have anything saying that it was sent.  Where is the proof that it was sent.  I never got a response from Ms. Boyd from my fax, she only gave me a fax number to get in touch with her.  I called back to let her know what the post master said and spoke to a customer service rep.  The rep did know who Ms. Boyd was and said she didn't see in the system where it had went to a supervisor.  I need to be able to go to work.  Ms. Boyd stated that in the past I have had other lapse yes and I always paid a fine when I was told I had to pay one.  I also have a adjustable mortgage rate trying to keep my home and me and my husband also was paying $600.00 a month in gas trying to get to and from work at this time.  I don't know of too many people that's not having major problems not unless they are rich.

This is the reply that Ms Charlotte Boyd, Hearing Officer replied to Ms. McCauley,

I spoke with Mrs. McCauley regarding this issue.  I asked her to verify her address to insure the address we have on file is correct and it was.  I asked her to explain the situation and she stated that her neighbor brought her the revocation letter yesterday and that is what prompted her to call.  We discussed her hearing and she stated that Officer Sanders asked her to fax the FS1 (proof of insurance) and explained to her she would receive a decision by mail.  She states she never received the decision letter but she did get the revocation letter.  She also stated that she was having issues with money.  This customer has had several lapses of coverage.  I advised her that if she was having issues receiving her mail, it would be necessary for her to contact her post master for documentation to assist in the decision to allow her to pay the overdue penalty.   She states she would contact the postmaster and have a letter faxed before a decision can be made.

Good Afternoon,

Currently, immigrants may continue to use a tax ID to obtain a duplicate license/ID card.  However, once the current document expires, the customer must prove citizenship or present legal presence documents for an issuance.  All new customers must present proof of citizenship or legal presence.

Mrs. McCauley,
the letter you faxed on 2-5-09 is the same testimony you provided me when we spoke on 2-5-09 with the exception of the information regarding your call to the post office.  During our conversation on 2-5-09, I explained that given the vehicle record/history and the number of lapses on this record, it would be necessary for you to provide documentation from your post master indicating that you are having issues receiving your mail as the letter was not returned to DMV.  

Your letter stated that you spoke with Ted on 2-5-09 and he stated they would not generate a letter and that the carrier during this time was a " Substitute Carrier and was unfamiliar with your rout. 

Today I called the post office and spoke to the supervisor, Alicia Hood who explained that this was the first time this issue had been reported and that report was received on 2-5-09 by Ted, who is a mail clerk, not qualified to answer your questions.  Ms. Hood states that during the time the letter from DMV was mailed to you, your regular carrier was on the route and no issues had been brought to his attention.  She further states that the letter in question was not returned "undeliverable" and the substitute carrier is very familiar with that route.  She states that there is not way to document that you did not receive the letter.  After speaking with Ms. Hood, I checked with our mail room and the letter was not returned to DMV.  I was told that if the letter had been returned, it would be annotated in the system and it is not.  Based on our last conversation at 5:24pm today, I explained that given the history of this record and your inability to provide any documentation, the plate will remain revoked.  

I also explained that I would review this case one final time to insure we have taken everything into consideration and call you tomorrow.  At this time the plate is revoked for 30 days and upon relicensing, you will be required to pay all penalties and the required fees to relicense the vehicle. 

Respectfully submitted,

Ms. Boyd,

I have told you several times that I did not receive the letter and you are pretty much saying I did.  The only way that you can guarantee that something has been delivered is to send certified.  You can't tell me what happened between your mail room and a delivery no more than I can tell you what happened.  You stated that you just received my fax yesterday afternoon.  How I know if that's so, you have never responded until you get something from the governor's office.  Now I know why it took four month's to get a hearing.  You keep saying I have had problems in the past yes and it was years apart and I paid my fine.   Maybe you need to take a look at your new process.   To ask the post office for something in writing was way out there when I told you from the beginning if I received someone else's mail I would take it to them I had never complained every one might not do that.

Cindy,

I don't feel like I'm being treated fairly.   Would you please let me discuss this with the governor.  Right now I'm calling rental places and car lots trying to get something so me and my husband can get to work,  and we don't have money to do this.   This is ridiculous.  Ms. Boyd told me on the phone yesterday it's not her problem.  I'm not saying in no way at all this is not my fault for having a lapse.  I'm saying that the results was based on a letter that I did not receive.


Thanks,

Mrs. McCauley,
the information contained in this email is not quite accurate.  When we spoke late yesterday evening, I explained that I could not discuss your financial situation as that information is outside the realm of my expertise.  I further explained I did not feel it was my place to get into your personal affairs.  I stated that while I understood your frustration, I was following the guidelines set forth in the Motor Vehicle Laws.  You were granted a hearing, given the opportunity to pay the fines and and you failed to do so.  I also explained that this was a reoccurring issue and each time your insurance lapse, you were allowed to pay those civil penalties and maintain your plate. 

You stated you did not receive the correspondence sent to you by the division, that is why I verified your address with you.  The address you provided was the same address in our system.  When you explained that your neighbor had received your mail, I asked if you had contacted the post office regarding this issue and asked for any documentation that would support your claim.  You contacted the post office and they would not provide the documentation because according to Supervisor Hood, she had no knowledge of issues in your area and that this was the first she had heard of your issues with not receiving your mail. 

When I received the initial inquiry, I reviewed your record in great detail.  That takes a little time as your record is quite extensive and you have more than one vehicle registered in your name.  On this vehicle alone your lapse in coverage is as follows:
8-8-05 through 8-12-05 (4 days lapse)
11-14-06 through 12-01-06 (18 days lapse)
5-14-08 through 5-29-08 (15 days lapse). 

I contacted the insurance company to verify the information and these were true periods of lapse coverage.  This record reflects a continues pattern and each time,  the division has afforded you the opportunity to pay the civil penalties when you fail to maintain continuous coverage.  Mrs. McCauley, giving you the opportunity to pay those fines does not excuse you from the responsibility of maintaining valid insurance coverage on your vehicles.  This is not only for your safety but for the safety of the other drivers in our state.    

Before we ended our conversation, I explained that I would  review your record to insure everything had been considered in your case.  The important issues that must be conveyed to you is, it is your responsibility to maintain valid insurance on the vehicles that you operate to avoid penalties and additional fines.  That is the law.  DMV is required to enforced the laws set forth as it relates to insurance violations.  

The evidence provided in this case are:
1.  You are a repeat lapser
2.  You provided no documentation indicating that this was due to no fault of your own
3.  In this particular case, you were given the opportunity to pay the civil penalty and you failed to do so.

Your statement is you did not receive the letter but there is nothing to support your claim.  This information has been documented and your address verified by you.  All future correspondence will be mailed to that address and if this should occur in the future, documentation will be required!  This is the final opportunity to pay these penalties.  If you should have any other lapses in coverage or you fail to pay the fines by the given date and time, you will not be afforded another opportunity and that has been documented on your record.  To insure you understand thoroughly what is required, I have listed the details.

You are required to pay the $50 civil penalty for the 1999 Chrysler 300 (vin #2c3he66g2xh608771) and the cost to relicense the vehicle.  There is also a $50 civil penalty and the relicensing fee required on the 2001 Chevy Tahoe(vin #ignek13t81r139986) when you relicense that vehicle.  

These fines must be paid before 4:00 pm tomorrow, February 11, 2009 to avoid further action.

Ms. Boyd,

I have told you several times that I did not receive the letter and you are pretty much saying I did.  The only way that you can guarantee that something has been delivered is to send certified.  You can't tell me what happened between your mail room and a delivery no more than I can tell you what happened.  You stated that you just received my fax yesterday afternoon.  How I know if that's so, you have never responded until you get something from the governor's office.  Now I know why it took four month's to get a hearing.  You keep saying I have had problems in the past yes and it was years apart and I paid my fine.   Maybe you need to take a look at your new process.   To ask the post office for something in writing was way out there when I told you from the beginning if I received someone else's mail I would take it to them I had never complained every one might not do that.

Cindy,

I don't feel like I'm being treated fairly.   Would you please let me discuss this with the governor.  Right now I'm calling rental places and car lots trying to get something so me and my husband can get to work,  and we don't have money to do this.   This is ridiculous.  Ms. Boyd told me on the phone yesterday it's not her problem.  I'm not saying in no way at all this is not my fault for having a lapse.  I'm saying that the results was based on a letter that I did not receive.

Mrs. McCauley,
the letter you faxed on 2-5-09 is the same testimony you provided me when we spoke on 2-5-09 with the exception of the information regarding your call to the post office.  During our conversation on 2-5-09, I explained that given the vehicle record/history and the number of lapses on this record, it would be necessary for you to provide documentation from your post master indicating that you are having issues receiving your mail as the letter was not returned to DMV.  

Your letter stated that you spoke with Ted on 2-5-09 and he stated they would not generate a letter and that the carrier during this time was a " Substitute Carrier and was unfamiliar with your rout.  

Today I called the post office and spoke to the supervisor, Alicia Hood who explained that this was the first time this issue had been reported and that report was received on 2-5-09 by Ted, who is a mail clerk, not qualified to answer your questions.  Ms. Hood states that during the time the letter from DMV was mailed to you, your regular carrier was on the route and no issues had been brought to his attention.  She further states that the letter in question was not returned "undeliverable" and the substitute carrier is very familiar with that route.  She states that there is not way to document that you did not receive the letter.  After speaking with Ms. Hood, I checked with our mail room and the letter was not returned to DMV.  I was told that if the letter had been returned, it would be annotated in the system and it is not.  Based on our last conversation at 5:24pm today, I explained that given the history of this record and your inability to provide any documentation, the plate will remain revoked.  

I also explained that I would review this case one final time to insure we have taken everything into consideration and call you tomorrow.  At this time the plate is revoked for 30 days and upon relicensing, you will be required to pay all penalties and the required fees to relicense the vehicle.  

Respectfully submitted,

Cindy/Ms. Boyd

I have confirmation of the letter that I faxed to Ms. Boyd on the same afternoon which was 2/5/09.  Letting her know that the postmaster had gone for the day and I spoke to a Ted which stated that my regular carrier had been out for two weeks sick and that could be the problem.  He also stated that he could not fax a letter I would have to call back the next morning.  I called back the morning of the 2/6/09 and spoke to the postmaster and he said that he's aware of a problem now and he could not fax anything because he don't have anything saying that it was sent.  Where is the proof that it was sent.  I never got a response from Ms. Boyd from my fax, she only gave me a fax number to get in touch with her.  I called back to let her know what the post master said and spoke to a customer service rep.  The rep did know who Ms. Boyd was and said she didn't see in the system where it had went to a supervisor.  I need to be able to go to work.  Ms. Boyd stated that in the past I have had other lapse yes and I always paid a fine when I was told I had to pay one.  I also have a adjustable mortgage rate trying to keep my home and me and my husband also was paying $600.00 a month in gas trying to get to and from work at this time.  I don't know of too many people that's not having major problems not unless they are rich.

This is the reply that Ms Charlotte Boyd, Hearing Officer replied to Ms. McCauley,

I spoke with Mrs. McCauley regarding this issue.  I asked her to verify her address to insure the address we have on file is correct and it was.  I asked her to explain the situation and she stated that her neighbor brought her the revocation letter yesterday and that is what prompted her to call.  We discussed her hearing and she stated that Officer Sanders asked her to fax the FS1 (proof of insurance) and explained to her she would receive a decision by mail.  She states she never received the decision letter but she did get the revocation letter.  She also stated that she was having issues with money.  This customer has had several lapses of coverage.  I advised her that if she was having issues receiving her mail, it would be necessary for her to contact her post master for documentation to assist in the decision to allow her to pay the overdue penalty.   She states she would contact the postmaster and have a letter faxed before a decision can be made.

Mrs. Boyd,
First off, I would like to say that I believe that this entire incident was a break down of communication on both of our parts.  In reviewing all of the information I have and that has been provided to me by the DMV and yourself, there were several places where the ball was simply dropped.

With that being said, I would like to formally thank you for all of the reviewing and time that you have spent on my case.  I would not have taken this issue this far if I did not feel like I was being treated fairly.  In addition, I noticed that past lapse that I have had was brought up several times.  My husband and I do our very best to make sure that all of our business is in order, and with that, there may have been a time where our financial issues may have changed.  Even with those unexpected changes, we make a point to pay our fines/dues/fees when applicable.  In the future we will make it a point to try to take all provisions to hopefully not allow our insurance to lapse.

In reviewing the e-mail again, I noticed that you only provided information (and relicensing agreements) for 2 vehicles, those being the Chevy Tahoe and Chrysler 300.  There is another vehicle that was also a part of this initial case, which is a 1996 Ford F150 which is the vehicle I explained perviously that my husband uses.  I want to make sure that when I arrive at the DMV this morning to pay all fines/fees/dues that I will be making these payments for all 3 vehicles.  Can you please advise me on the 1996 Ford as well? I will await your response before I go to the DMV.

Again, I am extending a thank you to not only you but Ms. Watkins and the staff at the Governor Bev Perdue's office and the office of NC DMV.

Sincerely

These fines must be paid before 4:00 pm tomorrow, February 11, 2009 to avoid further action.

Cindy/Ms. Boyd

I have confirmation of the letter that I faxed to Ms. Boyd on the same afternoon which was 2/5/09.  Letting her know that the postmaster had gone for the day and I spoke to a Ted which stated that my regular carrier had been out for two weeks sick and that could be the problem.  He also stated that he could not fax a letter I would have to call back the next morning.  I called back the morning of the 2/6/09 and spoke to the postmaster and he said that he's aware of a problem now and he could not fax anything because he don't have anything saying that it was sent.  Where is the proof that it was sent.  I never got a response from Ms. Boyd from my fax, she only gave me a fax number to get in touch with her.  I called back to let her know what the post master said and spoke to a customer service rep.  The rep did know who Ms. Boyd was and said she didn't see in the system where it had went to a supervisor.  I need to be able to go to work.  Ms. Boyd stated that in the past I have had other lapse yes and I always paid a fine when I was told I had to pay one.  I also have a adjustable mortgage rate trying to keep my home and me and my husband also was paying $600.00 a month in gas trying to get to and from work at this time.  I don't know of too many people that's not having major problems not unless they are rich.

This is the reply that Ms Charlotte Boyd, Hearing Officer replied to Ms. McCauley,

I spoke with Mrs. McCauley regarding this issue.  I asked her to verify her address to insure the address we have on file is correct and it was.  I asked her to explain the situation and she stated that her neighbor brought her the revocation letter yesterday and that is what prompted her to call.  We discussed her hearing and she stated that Officer Sanders asked her to fax the FS1 (proof of insurance) and explained to her she would receive a decision by mail.  She states she never received the decision letter but she did get the revocation letter.  She also stated that she was having issues with money.  This customer has had several lapses of coverage.  I advised her that if she was having issues receiving her mail, it would be necessary for her to contact her post master for documentation to assist in the decision to allow her to pay the overdue penalty.   She states she would contact the postmaster and have a letter faxed before a decision can be made.

Thanks

Ms. Boyd,

I have went to DMV at North Gate Mall  twice today trying to pay my fine and systems are down due to verizon phone lines being down.  You have gave me a 2/11/09 before 4:00 dead line.  DMV employee said that all DMV systems were down.  Now what do I do.  Is it a way to pay on line and if it is, what site do I go to pay.  Will you be giving me another day if systems do not come?

Thanks,

Mrs. Boyd,
First off, I would like to say that I believe that this entire incident was a break down of communication on both of our parts.  In reviewing all of the information I have and that has been provided to me by the DMV and yourself, there were several places where the ball was simply dropped.

With that being said, I would like to formally thank you for all of the reviewing and time that you have spent on my case.  I would not have taken this issue this far if I did not feel like I was being treated fairly.  In addition, I noticed that past lapse that I have had was brought up several times.  My husband and I do our very best to make sure that all of our business is in order, and with that, there may have been a time where our financial issues may have changed.  Even with those unexpected changes, we make a point to pay our fines/dues/fees when applicable.  In the future we will make it a point to try to take all provisions to hopefully not allow our insurance to lapse.

In reviewing the e-mail again, I noticed that you only provided information (and relicensing agreements) for 2 vehicles, those being the Chevy Tahoe and Chrysler 300.  There is another vehicle that was also a part of this initial case, which is a 1996 Ford F150 which is the vehicle I explained perviously that my husband uses.  I want to make sure that when I arrive at the DMV this morning to pay all fines/fees/dues that I will be making these payments for all 3 vehicles.  Can you please advise me on the 1996 Ford as well? I will await your response before I go to the DMV.

Again, I am extending a thank you to not only you but Ms. Watkins and the staff at the Governor Bev Perdue's office and the office of NC DMV.

Sincerely

Shirley McCauley,

	RE: FW: McCauley, Shirley - Please help me




Mrs. McCauley,
the information contained in this email is not quite accurate.  When we spoke late yesterday evening, I explained that I could not discuss your financial situation as that information is outside the realm of my expertise.  I further explained I did not feel it was my place to get into your personal affairs.  I stated that while I understood your frustration, I was following the guidelines set forth in the Motor Vehicle Laws.  You were granted a hearing, given the opportunity to pay the fines and and you failed to do so.  I also explained that this was a reoccurring issue and each time your insurance lapse, you were allowed to pay those civil penalties and maintain your plate.  

You stated you did not receive the correspondence sent to you by the division, that is why I verified your address with you.  The address you provided was the same address in our system.  When you explained that your neighbor had received your mail, I asked if you had contacted the post office regarding this issue and asked for any documentation that would support your claim.  You contacted the post office and they would not provide the documentation because according to Supervisor Hood, she had no knowledge of issues in your area and that this was the first she had heard of your issues with not receiving your mail.  

When I received the initial inquiry, I reviewed your record in great detail.  That takes a little time as your record is quite extensive and you have more than one vehicle registered in your name.  On this vehicle alone your lapse in coverage is as follows:
8-8-05 through 8-12-05 (4 days lapse)
11-14-06 through 12-01-06 (18 days lapse)
5-14-08 through 5-29-08 (15 days lapse).  

I contacted the insurance company to verify the information and these were true periods of lapse coverage.  This record reflects a continues pattern and each time,  the division has afforded you the opportunity to pay the civil penalties when you fail to maintain continuous coverage.  Mrs. McCauley, giving you the opportunity to pay those fines does not excuse you from the responsibility of maintaining valid insurance coverage on your vehicles.  This is not only for your safety but for the safety of the other drivers in our state.    

Before we ended our conversation, I explained that I would  review your record to insure everything had been considered in your case.  The important issues that must be conveyed to you is, it is your responsibility to maintain valid insurance on the vehicles that you operate to avoid penalties and additional fines.  That is the law.  DMV is required to enforced the laws set forth as it relates to insurance violations.  

The evidence provided in this case are:
1.  You are a repeat lapser
2.  You provided no documentation indicating that this was due to no fault of your own
3.  In this particular case, you were given the opportunity to pay the civil penalty and you failed to do so.

Your statement is you did not receive the letter but there is nothing to support your claim.  This information has been documented and your address verified by you.  All future correspondence will be mailed to that address and if this should occur in the future, documentation will be required!  This is the final opportunity to pay these penalties.  If you should have any other lapses in coverage or you fail to pay the fines by the given date and time, you will not be afforded another opportunity and that has been documented on your record.  To insure you understand thoroughly what is required, I have listed the details.

You are required to pay the $50 civil penalty for the 1999 Chrysler 300 (vin #2c3he66g2xh608771) and the cost to relicense the vehicle.  There is also a $50 civil penalty and the relicensing fee required on the 2001 Chevy Tahoe(vin #ignek13t81r139986) when you relicense that vehicle.  

These fines must be paid before 4:00 pm tomorrow, February 11, 2009 to avoid further action.

Ms. Boyd,

I have told you several times that I did not receive the letter and you are pretty much saying I did.  The only way that you can guarantee that something has been delivered is to send certified.  You can't tell me what happened between your mail room and a delivery no more than I can tell you what happened.  You stated that you just received my fax yesterday afternoon.  How I know if that's so, you have never responded until you get something from the governor's office.  Now I know why it took four month's to get a hearing.  You keep saying I have had problems in the past yes and it was years apart and I paid my fine.   Maybe you need to take a look at your new process.   To ask the post office for something in writing was way out there when I told you from the beginning if I received someone else's mail I would take it to them I had never complained every one might not do that.

Cindy,

I don't feel like I'm being treated fairly.   Would you please let me discuss this with the governor.  Right now I'm calling rental places and car lots trying to get something so me and my husband can get to work,  and we don't have money to do this.   This is ridiculous.  Ms. Boyd told me on the phone yesterday it's not her problem.  I'm not saying in no way at all this is not my fault for having a lapse.  I'm saying that the results was based on a letter that I did not receive.

Mrs. McCauley,
the letter you faxed on 2-5-09 is the same testimony you provided me when we spoke on 2-5-09 with the exception of the information regarding your call to the post office.  During our conversation on 2-5-09, I explained that given the vehicle record/history and the number of lapses on this record, it would be necessary for you to provide documentation from your post master indicating that you are having issues receiving your mail as the letter was not returned to DMV.  

Your letter stated that you spoke with Ted on 2-5-09 and he stated they would not generate a letter and that the carrier during this time was a " Substitute Carrier and was unfamiliar with your rout.  

Today I called the post office and spoke to the supervisor, Alicia Hood who explained that this was the first time this issue had been reported and that report was received on 2-5-09 by Ted, who is a mail clerk, not qualified to answer your questions.  Ms. Hood states that during the time the letter from DMV was mailed to you, your regular carrier was on the route and no issues had been brought to his attention.  She further states that the letter in question was not returned "undeliverable" and the substitute carrier is very familiar with that route.  She states that there is not way to document that you did not receive the letter.  After speaking with Ms. Hood, I checked with our mail room and the letter was not returned to DMV.  I was told that if the letter had been returned, it would be annotated in the system and it is not.  Based on our last conversation at 5:24pm today, I explained that given the history of this record and your inability to provide any documentation, the plate will remain revoked.  

I also explained that I would review this case one final time to insure we have taken everything into consideration and call you tomorrow.  At this time the plate is revoked for 30 days and upon relicensing, you will be required to pay all penalties and the required fees to relicense the vehicle.  

Respectfully submitted,

Mrs. McCauley,
I just received your email.  The 96 Ford which is registered to Walter Caldwell McCauley Jr. and Mary Whitted McCauley falls into the same category.  A $50 civil penalty is also due on that vehicle and the cost to relicense.  As noted in your email financial difficulties arise but please also remember it is against the law to drive your vehicle without insurance.  The division has been tasked  to enforce the laws as they relate to Liability Insurance.  I sincerely hope this issue does not occur again as this opportunity will not be afforded again. Please remember all fines and penalties must be paid by 4:00 pm today to prevent further action.

Good luck

With that being said, I would like to formally thank you for all of the reviewing and time that you have spent on my case.  I would not have taken this issue this far if I did not feel like I was being treated fairly.  In addition, I noticed that past lapse that I have had was brought up several times.  My husband and I do our very best to make sure that all of our business is in order, and with that, there may have been a time where our financial issues may have changed.  Even with those unexpected changes, we make a point to pay our fines/dues/fees when applicable.  In the future we will make it a point to try to take all provisions to hopefully not allow our insurance to lapse.

In reviewing the e-mail again, I noticed that you only provided information (and relicensing agreements) for 2 vehicles, those being the Chevy Tahoe and Chrysler 300.  There is another vehicle that was also a part of this initial case, which is a 1996 Ford F150 which is the vehicle I explained perviously that my husband uses.  I want to make sure that when I arrive at the DMV this morning to pay all fines/fees/dues that I will be making these payments for all 3 vehicles.  Can you please advise me on the 1996 Ford as well? I will await your response before I go to the DMV.

Again, I am extending a thank you to not only you but Ms. Watkins and the staff at the Governor Bev Perdue's office and the office of NC DMV.

Sincerely

Mrs. McCauley,
the information contained in this email is not quite accurate.  When we spoke late yesterday evening, I explained that I could not discuss your financial situation as that information is outside the realm of my expertise.  I further explained I did not feel it was my place to get into your personal affairs.  I stated that while I understood your frustration, I was following the guidelines set forth in the Motor Vehicle Laws.  You were granted a hearing, given the opportunity to pay the fines and and you failed to do so.  I also explained that this was a reoccurring issue and each time your insurance lapse, you were allowed to pay those civil penalties and maintain your plate.  

You stated you did not receive the correspondence sent to you by the division, that is why I verified your address with you.  The address you provided was the same address in our system.  When you explained that your neighbor had received your mail, I asked if you had contacted the post office regarding this issue and asked for any documentation that would support your claim.  You contacted the post office and they would not provide the documentation because according to Supervisor Hood, she had no knowledge of issues in your area and that this was the first she had heard of your issues with not receiving your mail.  

When I received the initial inquiry, I reviewed your record in great detail.  That takes a little time as your record is quite extensive and you have more than one vehicle registered in your name.  On this vehicle alone your lapse in coverage is as follows:
8-8-05 through 8-12-05 (4 days lapse)
11-14-06 through 12-01-06 (18 days lapse)
5-14-08 through 5-29-08 (15 days lapse).  

I contacted the insurance company to verify the information and these were true periods of lapse coverage.  This record reflects a continues pattern and each time,  the division has afforded you the opportunity to pay the civil penalties when you fail to maintain continuous coverage.  Mrs. McCauley, giving you the opportunity to pay those fines does not excuse you from the responsibility of maintaining valid insurance coverage on your vehicles.  This is not only for your safety but for the safety of the other drivers in our state.    

Before we ended our conversation, I explained that I would  review your record to insure everything had been considered in your case.  The important issues that must be conveyed to you is, it is your responsibility to maintain valid insurance on the vehicles that you operate to avoid penalties and additional fines.  That is the law.  DMV is required to enforced the laws set forth as it relates to insurance violations.  

The evidence provided in this case are:
1.  You are a repeat lapser
2.  You provided no documentation indicating that this was due to no fault of your own
3.  In this particular case, you were given the opportunity to pay the civil penalty and you failed to do so.

Your statement is you did not receive the letter but there is nothing to support your claim.  This information has been documented and your address verified by you.  All future correspondence will be mailed to that address and if this should occur in the future, documentation will be required!  This is the final opportunity to pay these penalties.  If you should have any other lapses in coverage or you fail to pay the fines by the given date and time, you will not be afforded another opportunity and that has been documented on your record.  To insure you understand thoroughly what is required, I have listed the details.

You are required to pay the $50 civil penalty for the 1999 Chrysler 300 (vin #2c3he66g2xh608771) and the cost to relicense the vehicle.  There is also a $50 civil penalty and the relicensing fee required on the 2001 Chevy Tahoe(vin #ignek13t81r139986) when you relicense that vehicle.  

These fines must be paid before 4:00 pm tomorrow, February 11, 2009 to avoid further action.

Ms. Boyd,

I have told you several times that I did not receive the letter and you are pretty much saying I did.  The only way that you can guarantee that something has been delivered is to send certified.  You can't tell me what happened between your mail room and a delivery no more than I can tell you what happened.  You stated that you just received my fax yesterday afternoon.  How I know if that's so, you have never responded until you get something from the governor's office.  Now I know why it took four month's to get a hearing.  You keep saying I have had problems in the past yes and it was years apart and I paid my fine.   Maybe you need to take a look at your new process.   To ask the post office for something in writing was way out there when I told you from the beginning if I received someone else's mail I would take it to them I had never complained every one might not do that.

Cindy,

I don't feel like I'm being treated fairly.   Would you please let me discuss this with the governor.  Right now I'm calling rental places and car lots trying to get something so me and my husband can get to work,  and we don't have money to do this.   This is ridiculous.  Ms. Boyd told me on the phone yesterday it's not her problem.  I'm not saying in no way at all this is not my fault for having a lapse.  I'm saying that the results was based on a letter that I did not receive.

Mrs. McCauley,
the letter you faxed on 2-5-09 is the same testimony you provided me when we spoke on 2-5-09 with the exception of the information regarding your call to the post office.  During our conversation on 2-5-09, I explained that given the vehicle record/history and the number of lapses on this record, it would be necessary for you to provide documentation from your post master indicating that you are having issues receiving your mail as the letter was not returned to DMV.  

Your letter stated that you spoke with Ted on 2-5-09 and he stated they would not generate a letter and that the carrier during this time was a " Substitute Carrier and was unfamiliar with your rout.  

Today I called the post office and spoke to the supervisor, Alicia Hood who explained that this was the first time this issue had been reported and that report was received on 2-5-09 by Ted, who is a mail clerk, not qualified to answer your questions.  Ms. Hood states that during the time the letter from DMV was mailed to you, your regular carrier was on the route and no issues had been brought to his attention.  She further states that the letter in question was not returned "undeliverable" and the substitute carrier is very familiar with that route.  She states that there is not way to document that you did not receive the letter.  After speaking with Ms. Hood, I checked with our mail room and the letter was not returned to DMV.  I was told that if the letter had been returned, it would be annotated in the system and it is not.  Based on our last conversation at 5:24pm today, I explained that given the history of this record and your inability to provide any documentation, the plate will remain revoked.  

I also explained that I would review this case one final time to insure we have taken everything into consideration and call you tomorrow.  At this time the plate is revoked for 30 days and upon relicensing, you will be required to pay all penalties and the required fees to relicense the vehicle.  

Respectfully submitted,

Cindy/Ms. Boyd

I have confirmation of the letter that I faxed to Ms. Boyd on the same afternoon which was 2/5/09.  Letting her know that the postmaster had gone for the day and I spoke to a Ted which stated that my regular carrier had been out for two weeks sick and that could be the problem.  He also stated that he could not fax a letter I would have to call back the next morning.  I called back the morning of the 2/6/09 and spoke to the postmaster and he said that he's aware of a problem now and he could not fax anything because he don't have anything saying that it was sent.  Where is the proof that it was sent.  I never got a response from Ms. Boyd from my fax, she only gave me a fax number to get in touch with her.  I called back to let her know what the post master said and spoke to a customer service rep.  The rep did know who Ms. Boyd was and said she didn't see in the system where it had went to a supervisor.  I need to be able to go to work.  Ms. Boyd stated that in the past I have had other lapse yes and I always paid a fine when I was told I had to pay one.  I also have a adjustable mortgage rate trying to keep my home and me and my husband also was paying $600.00 a month in gas trying to get to and from work at this time.  I don't know of too many people that's not having major problems not unless they are rich.

This is the reply that Ms Charlotte Boyd, Hearing Officer replied to Ms. McCauley,

I spoke with Mrs. McCauley regarding this issue.  I asked her to verify her address to insure the address we have on file is correct and it was.  I asked her to explain the situation and she stated that her neighbor brought her the revocation letter yesterday and that is what prompted her to call.  We discussed her hearing and she stated that Officer Sanders asked her to fax the FS1 (proof of insurance) and explained to her she would receive a decision by mail.  She states she never received the decision letter but she did get the revocation letter.  She also stated that she was having issues with money.  This customer has had several lapses of coverage.  I advised her that if she was having issues receiving her mail, it would be necessary for her to contact her post master for documentation to assist in the decision to allow her to pay the overdue penalty.   She states she would contact the postmaster and have a letter faxed before a decision can be made.

Thanks

Ms. Boyd,

I have went to DMV at North Gate Mall  twice today trying to pay my fine and systems are down due to verizon phone lines being down.  You have gave me a 2/11/09 before 4:00 dead line.  DMV employee said that all DMV systems were down.  Now what do I do.  Is it a way to pay on line and if it is, what site do I go to pay.  Will you be giving me another day if systems do not come?

Mrs. McCauley,
the letter you faxed on 2-5-09 is the same testimony you provided me when we spoke on 2-5-09 with the exception of the information regarding your call to the post office.  During our conversation on 2-5-09, I explained that given the vehicle record/history and the number of lapses on this record, it would be necessary for you to provide documentation from your post master indicating that you are having issues receiving your mail as the letter was not returned to DMV.  

Your letter stated that you spoke with Ted on 2-5-09 and he stated they would not generate a letter and that the carrier during this time was a " Substitute Carrier and was unfamiliar with your rout.  

Today I called the post office and spoke to the supervisor, Alicia Hood who explained that this was the first time this issue had been reported and that report was received on 2-5-09 by Ted, who is a mail clerk, not qualified to answer your questions.  Ms. Hood states that during the time the letter from DMV was mailed to you, your regular carrier was on the route and no issues had been brought to his attention.  She further states that the letter in question was not returned "undeliverable" and the substitute carrier is very familiar with that route.  She states that there is not way to document that you did not receive the letter.  After speaking with Ms. Hood, I checked with our mail room and the letter was not returned to DMV.  I was told that if the letter had been returned, it would be annotated in the system and it is not.  Based on our last conversation at 5:24pm today, I explained that given the history of this record and your inability to provide any documentation, the plate will remain revoked.  

I also explained that I would review this case one final time to insure we have taken everything into consideration and call you tomorrow.  At this time the plate is revoked for 30 days and upon relicensing, you will be required to pay all penalties and the required fees to relicense the vehicle.  

Respectfully submitted,

Cindy/Ms. Boyd

I have confirmation of the letter that I faxed to Ms. Boyd on the same afternoon which was 2/5/09.  Letting her know that the postmaster had gone for the day and I spoke to a Ted which stated that my regular carrier had been out for two weeks sick and that could be the problem.  He also stated that he could not fax a letter I would have to call back the next morning.  I called back the morning of the 2/6/09 and spoke to the postmaster and he said that he's aware of a problem now and he could not fax anything because he don't have anything saying that it was sent.  Where is the proof that it was sent.  I never got a response from Ms. Boyd from my fax, she only gave me a fax number to get in touch with her.  I called back to let her know what the post master said and spoke to a customer service rep.  The rep did know who Ms. Boyd was and said she didn't see in the system where it had went to a supervisor.  I need to be able to go to work.  Ms. Boyd stated that in the past I have had other lapse yes and I always paid a fine when I was told I had to pay one.  I also have a adjustable mortgage rate trying to keep my home and me and my husband also was paying $600.00 a month in gas trying to get to and from work at this time.  I don't know of too many people that's not having major problems not unless they are rich.

This is the reply that Ms Charlotte Boyd, Hearing Officer replied to Ms. McCauley,

I spoke with Mrs. McCauley regarding this issue.  I asked her to verify her address to insure the address we have on file is correct and it was.  I asked her to explain the situation and she stated that her neighbor brought her the revocation letter yesterday and that is what prompted her to call.  We discussed her hearing and she stated that Officer Sanders asked her to fax the FS1 (proof of insurance) and explained to her she would receive a decision by mail.  She states she never received the decision letter but she did get the revocation letter.  She also stated that she was having issues with money.  This customer has had several lapses of coverage.  I advised her that if she was having issues receiving her mail, it would be necessary for her to contact her post master for documentation to assist in the decision to allow her to pay the overdue penalty.   She states she would contact the postmaster and have a letter faxed before a decision can be made.

Thanks

Yes.  I paid $50.00 fines on all three vehicles and updated renewals for 2001 and 1996 which were coming due the end of the month.  I guess I took care of everything they told me to pay.  I asked her what was the relicense fee, she said the $50.00 fine would take care of it.

Ms. Boyd,

I have went to DMV at North Gate Mall  twice today trying to pay my fine and systems are down due to verizon phone lines being down.  You have gave me a 2/11/09 before 4:00 dead line.  DMV employee said that all DMV systems were down.  Now what do I do.  Is it a way to pay on line and if it is, what site do I go to pay.  Will you be giving me another day if systems do not come?

Mrs. Boyd,
First off, I would like to say that I believe that this entire incident was a break down of communication on both of our parts.  In reviewing all of the information I have and that has been provided to me by the DMV and yourself, there were several places where the ball was simply dropped.

With that being said, I would like to formally thank you for all of the reviewing and time that you have spent on my case.  I would not have taken this issue this far if I did not feel like I was being treated fairly.  In addition, I noticed that past lapse that I have had was brought up several times.  My husband and I do our very best to make sure that all of our business is in order, and with that, there may have been a time where our financial issues may have changed.  Even with those unexpected changes, we make a point to pay our fines/dues/fees when applicable.  In the future we will make it a point to try to take all provisions to hopefully not allow our insurance to lapse.

In reviewing the e-mail again, I noticed that you only provided information (and relicensing agreements) for 2 vehicles, those being the Chevy Tahoe and Chrysler 300.  There is another vehicle that was also a part of this initial case, which is a 1996 Ford F150 which is the vehicle I explained perviously that my husband uses.  I want to make sure that when I arrive at the DMV this morning to pay all fines/fees/dues that I will be making these payments for all 3 vehicles.  Can you please advise me on the 1996 Ford as well? I will await your response before I go to the DMV.

Again, I am extending a thank you to not only you but Ms. Watkins and the staff at the Governor Bev Perdue's office and the office of NC DMV.

Sincerely

Shirley McCauley,

	RE: FW: McCauley, Shirley - Please help me






Mrs. McCauley,
the information contained in this email is not quite accurate.  When we spoke late yesterday evening, I explained that I could not discuss your financial situation as that information is outside the realm of my expertise.  I further explained I did not feel it was my place to get into your personal affairs.  I stated that while I understood your frustration, I was following the guidelines set forth in the Motor Vehicle Laws.  You were granted a hearing, given the opportunity to pay the fines and and you failed to do so.  I also explained that this was a reoccurring issue and each time your insurance lapse, you were allowed to pay those civil penalties and maintain your plate.  

You stated you did not receive the correspondence sent to you by the division, that is why I verified your address with you.  The address you provided was the same address in our system.  When you explained that your neighbor had received your mail, I asked if you had contacted the post office regarding this issue and asked for any documentation that would support your claim.  You contacted the post office and they would not provide the documentation because according to Supervisor Hood, she had no knowledge of issues in your area and that this was the first she had heard of your issues with not receiving your mail.  

When I received the initial inquiry, I reviewed your record in great detail.  That takes a little time as your record is quite extensive and you have more than one vehicle registered in your name.  On this vehicle alone your lapse in coverage is as follows:
8-8-05 through 8-12-05 (4 days lapse)
11-14-06 through 12-01-06 (18 days lapse)
5-14-08 through 5-29-08 (15 days lapse).  

I contacted the insurance company to verify the information and these were true periods of lapse coverage.  This record reflects a continues pattern and each time,  the division has afforded you the opportunity to pay the civil penalties when you fail to maintain continuous coverage.  Mrs. McCauley, giving you the opportunity to pay those fines does not excuse you from the responsibility of maintaining valid insurance coverage on your vehicles.  This is not only for your safety but for the safety of the other drivers in our state.    

Before we ended our conversation, I explained that I would  review your record to insure everything had been considered in your case.  The important issues that must be conveyed to you is, it is your responsibility to maintain valid insurance on the vehicles that you operate to avoid penalties and additional fines.  That is the law.  DMV is required to enforced the laws set forth as it relates to insurance violations.  

The evidence provided in this case are:
1.  You are a repeat lapser
2.  You provided no documentation indicating that this was due to no fault of your own
3.  In this particular case, you were given the opportunity to pay the civil penalty and you failed to do so.

Your statement is you did not receive the letter but there is nothing to support your claim.  This information has been documented and your address verified by you.  All future correspondence will be mailed to that address and if this should occur in the future, documentation will be required!  This is the final opportunity to pay these penalties.  If you should have any other lapses in coverage or you fail to pay the fines by the given date and time, you will not be afforded another opportunity and that has been documented on your record.  To insure you understand thoroughly what is required, I have listed the details.

You are required to pay the $50 civil penalty for the 1999 Chrysler 300 (vin #2c3he66g2xh608771) and the cost to relicense the vehicle.  There is also a $50 civil penalty and the relicensing fee required on the 2001 Chevy Tahoe(vin #ignek13t81r139986) when you relicense that vehicle.  

These fines must be paid before 4:00 pm tomorrow, February 11, 2009 to avoid further action.

Ms. Boyd,

I have told you several times that I did not receive the letter and you are pretty much saying I did.  The only way that you can guarantee that something has been delivered is to send certified.  You can't tell me what happened between your mail room and a delivery no more than I can tell you what happened.  You stated that you just received my fax yesterday afternoon.  How I know if that's so, you have never responded until you get something from the governor's office.  Now I know why it took four month's to get a hearing.  You keep saying I have had problems in the past yes and it was years apart and I paid my fine.   Maybe you need to take a look at your new process.   To ask the post office for something in writing was way out there when I told you from the beginning if I received someone else's mail I would take it to them I had never complained every one might not do that.

Cindy,

I don't feel like I'm being treated fairly.   Would you please let me discuss this with the governor.  Right now I'm calling rental places and car lots trying to get something so me and my husband can get to work,  and we don't have money to do this.   This is ridiculous.  Ms. Boyd told me on the phone yesterday it's not her problem.  I'm not saying in no way at all this is not my fault for having a lapse.  I'm saying that the results was based on a letter that I did not receive.

I spoke with Mrs. McCauley regarding this issue.  I asked her to verify her address to insure the address we have on file is correct and it was.  I asked her to explain the situation and she stated that her neighbor brought her the revocation letter yesterday and that is what prompted her to call.  We discussed her hearing and she stated that Officer Sanders asked her to fax the FS1 (proof of insurance) and explained to her she would receive a decision by mail.  She states she never received the decision letter but she did get the revocation letter.  She also stated that she was having issues with money.  This customer has had several lapses of coverage.  I advised her that if she was having issues receiving her mail, it would be necessary for her to contact her post master for documentation to assist in the decision to allow her to pay the overdue penalty.   She states she would contact the postmaster and have a letter faxed before a decision can be made.

Thanks

Good Morning everyone.  I spoke Mr. Kent this morning regarding his concern on his driving privilege.  I explained to him that under GS 20-28 & 20-28.1 on 12/1/07 a law was passed that on a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd offense of either was eligible to have a ldp at a certain point of the suspension as long as the convictions did not occur during a alcohol related offense.  I also explained to him that he had to PJC's available at this time.  And I gave him the actual date he was eligible for a hearing. 
Hope you have a great day.
Thanks,

If you are able to read or see your drivers license, you can request a duplicate online for $10.00. 

The online site is:  <http://www.ncdot.org/>www.ncdot.org.

Once you have the home page up:

1. on the yellow banner click on DMV

2. next page - left side - under online services - then under Drivers - click on duplicate license/ID card

This will take you to the instructions of requesting your duplicate.



Once, you request your duplicate you can contact me to have the drivers license shipped by Federal Express.  I will need your credit card number and expiration date, along with the address you will need to have it sent to.  Please contact me the same day that you have requested online or no later than 8:30 the next business day to request your drivers license to be sent by Federal Express.



If you have questions or need assistance in requesting your duplicate, please contact me at the number below.



Have a blessed day!

Thank you very much for your help. This was a mistake on my part. I see now that it is 2009, not 2008. Due to the severe conditions I have been living in for the last 5 years, my license has deteriorated to the point it is almost illegible. Is there any way I can get that renewed? When I am driving in a foreign country, this could prove to be a problem.
 Either way, thank you very much for your help, and I look forward to hearing from you again.

James,

After reviewing your information for a request by mail.   We are not able to renew at this time.  You can only request a renewal 6 months prior to the expiration date.  You can begin your request in May of 2009.  Also,  you hold a CDL with a A endoresment.  CDL's cannot be renewed by mail.  We can drop you to a class C for a renewal by mail until you return and go into a examiners office to have the endorsement added back.

Have a blessed day!

Thank you for writing, Mrs. Clancy. The security element on the back of the North Carolina driver license was discontinued on October 20, 2008. In the two years it was used, it added $.12 to the cost of each driver license, or about $720,000 over the two-year period. The $.12 per license was paid with DMV funds. The security element was established as a nationwide effort to identify driver licenses as manufactured by bona fide state agencies and to make them more difficult to counterfeit. The element was designed by motor vehicle administrators from throughout the country to assist law enforcement, and others who might need to check driver licenses, in identifying and verifying the license as one issued legally.  It was also a way for all license-issuing agencies throughout the country to carry a security element on licenses that was common to all of them. After the pilot project by North Carolina, the group (the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators) decided not to take the program nationwide. The group, as well as the North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles, continue to be concerned with strengthening the security of the driver licenses we issue. 

Sincerely,

Marge Howell

Good Afternoon Mr. Keistler.  I have reviewed your record and it reflects that you have a couple of outstanding citations and fines.
Failure to Appear Gaston County Court: 99cr16756 which is a DWI rec'd on 5/16/99 there is also a open container after consuming alcohol charge. There is also a civil revocation fine to Gaston County Court. Their phone number is 704-852-3100.
Also you must complete a Substance abuse assesment evaluation with treatment or classes for the DWI 12/1/04.  Once DMV receive's the 508 form for the treatment the suspension for that DWI will be over.  But unfortunately if you are convicted of the '99 DWI you will have another year suspension for that conviction.
NC must have compliance to all charges and fines and assesments before any hold can be released on the national driver registry.
If you have any further questions please feel free to contact me at 919-861-3807.

Ms. Mary Jane Gordner,  

This email acknowledges your concerns about Liability Insurance and why the
the Division did not have record of the policy cancellation on the vehicle that
was involved in an accident with you on 02/09/2009.

G.S. 20-309 (e) Upon termination by cancellation or otherwise of  an insurance
policy provided in subsection (b) of this section, the insurer shall notify the
Division of the termination within 20 business days; provided, no cancellation
notice is required if the same insurer issues a replacement insurance policy
complying with this Article at the same time the insurer cancels or otherwise
terminates, the old policy, no lapse in coverage policy to the Division.

There are approximately 8.8 million registered motor vehicles in the State
of North Carolina.  The registered motorists  consist of 6,611,358
licensed drivers; with a 2 % growth each year. (Keep in mind, some drivers
own multiple vehicles and statistics do not include out of state drivers).
NCDMV, as an agency of the state, is constantly, enforcing the
aforementioned law with assistance from local city and county law enforcement
agencies to keep uninsured motorist off the streets.        

NCDMV strives to provide accurate information in a timely manner. The current  
system used by the Division to identify uninsured motorists is designed to  
capture the motorists insurance information  submitted by the insurance companies.
The majority of the uninsured are captured.  Unfortunately, some uninsured motorists  
are not caught.  Like any other mechanism used for detection, it is not 100 % fool proof.

To make the insurance company's take more responsibility to curb the number of 
motorists in the state, we always recommend the public to talk their legislator and
discuss the issue at hand.

Thank you for expressing your concerns and willingness to decrease even more, the amount
of uninsured motorists in North Carolina.

Officer T. K. Dorsey
Problem Resolution Hearing Officer

The Charlotte police officer filed 20090209072801 without putting in that it was a hit and run. I also called the persons insurance company Allstate Indemnity only to find that the policy was terminated on 8-16-08. I called the DMV and they still showed the policy # as valid for the registered owner. They were never notified by Allstate Indemnity that the policy was no longer in effect. Is there not a time limit on how long the insurance company has to report a lapse in coverage to the DMV? How can we stop the public from being taken by non insured motorists if the insurance company's who charge us for the uninsured/underinsured do not report them to the DMV so as to take away their tags and fine them. What can be done to make the insurance company’s take responsibility to curb the number of uninsured motorists in the state? Who can I talk to about this?

Ms. Mary Jane Gordner,  

This email acknowledges your concerns about Liability Insurance and why the
the Division did not have record of the policy cancellation on the vehicle that
was involved in an accident with you on 02/09/2009.

G.S. 20-309 (e) Upon termination by cancellation or otherwise of  an insurance
policy provided in subsection (b) of this section, the insurer shall notify the
Division of the termination within 20 business days; provided, no cancellation
notice is required if the same insurer issues a replacement insurance policy
complying with this Article at the same time the insurer cancels or otherwise
terminates, the old policy, no lapse in coverage policy to the Division.

There are approximately 8.8 million registered motor vehicles in the State
of North Carolina.  The registered motorists  consist of 6,611,358
licensed drivers; with a 2 % growth each year. (Keep in mind, some drivers
own multiple vehicles and statistics do not include out of state drivers).
NCDMV, as an agency of the state, is constantly, enforcing the
aforementioned law with assistance from local city and county law enforcement
agencies to keep uninsured motorist off the streets.        

NCDMV strives to provide accurate information in a timely manner. The current  
system used by the Division to identify uninsured motorists is designed to  
capture the motorists insurance information  submitted by the insurance companies.
The majority of the uninsured are captured.  Unfortunately, some uninsured motorists  
are not caught.  Like any other mechanism used for detection, it is not 100 % fool proof.

To make the insurance company's take more responsibility to curb the number of 
motorists in the state, we always recommend the public to talk their legislator and
discuss the issue at hand.

Thank you for expressing your concerns and willingness to decrease even more, the amount
of uninsured motorists in North Carolina.

Officer T. K. Dorsey

I have contacted Senator Blake's office regarding Mr. Dorman's driving record regarding the ignition interlock.  He was not in at the time so I spoke with his assistant and explained to her that because Mr. Dorman had blew greater than .15 and also had another DWI in the previous 7 years he would have to have the device for 1 year.  I also explained to her that the law went into effect 7/1/00 and Mr. Dorman has never had the device installed.  I left my name and direct line in case Senator Blake had anymore questions.

Dear Mr. Blake,

  Given the less than moral conduct of "Persons" entrusted with the authority to manage my case and the time that has elapsed as a result, any imposed "Ignition Interlock Restriction" whether installed or not prior to getting another License Card issued by the DMV would be a less than legal/moral outcome.

Subject: Inspection requirements

Mr. Howell,
The Governor asked that I respond to your question regarding inspection requirements for certain vehicles.
In the late 1980’s, Congress was wrestling with the increasing nationwide problem of Air Pollution. The number of vehicles traveling on the nations highways was rapidly increasing, and there were warnings of dwindling oil reserves. In an effort to combat these problems, the Clean Air Act of 1990 was enacted. The Clean Air Act gave the U.S. Protection Agency (EPA) the responsibility for developing and implementing a Mobile Source Emission Reduction Program. This program pursues a three point strategy for reducing emissions from transportation sources. The first two points involve the development and commercialization of cleaner vehicles and cleaner fuels. The third point focuses on in-use control to ensure that cars in customer use are properly maintained.
As part of this strategy, the EPA requires On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) system checks as a component of inspection programs. Although OBD is not new to vehicle manufacturers, it was not standardized to allow for this type of testing on all vehicles until 1996. Because OBD testing cannot be conducted on 1995 and older vehicles, and the EPA determined that these model years make up such a small percentage of the motoring population, with continued reduction each year, there was no need to require emissions testing on these vehicles.

As previously indicated, the EPA recognizes the benefits of cleaner vehicles and encourages development and use nationwide. However, if not properly maintained, these vehicles can also contribute to air pollution. Therefore, the EPA requires all 1996 and newer vehicles to receive periodic testing.

I trust this information was useful. If I can be of further assistance, please advise.

Mr. Howell,
The North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles cannot advise how other states comply with the mandates established by the EPA. However, in accordance with our State Implementation Plan and State Laws, all 1996 and newer, gasoline operated vehicles registered in an emissions county are subject to this test.  This testing is required regardless of the vehicles distinction as a low emissions vehicle.

By way of this email, I am forwarding your questions to Mr. Paul Gordey, Lead IM Engineer with the Division of Air Quality for additional information.

If I may be further assistance, please advise.

Thank you for a clear response to one of my two questions.  The other question which you did not answer is:  Why does my new near zero emission Prius require an emissions inspection at all?  Are you aware that Colorado, Washington, California , Washington and other States do not require such emission tests for the Prius?  Is it because our NC official are not as tech. smart as those of other States?  Please say it isn't so.
Looking forward to you response.

Cindy,

My apologies for not responding sooner. I see on the file where Mr. Jolicoeur had requested a hearing in September. The Hearing officer sent him a packet for a DWI Interview and it was to be completed by Mr. Jolicoeur by October 14, 2008.  This has not been completed yet. I tried reaching him on the number we have on file and was unsuccessful. I have also sent him an email asking him to call me.  I will respond once I have heard from him.

Again, my apologies.

Sincerely,

Pat Clancy
Regional Hearing Supervisor

Following is the question just received:

Visitor: Mr. Louis Jolicoeur

Address: 212 McCaslin Blvd, Louisville, CO 80027

Email: lcj01010@aol.com

Subject: NC DL

Comment: My ND DL was revoked back in 1994. I need it reinstated and NC is demanding I come there for a hearing. I have not pressed the issue because there was not a reason too - I had a job here and had no real need for a DL. Times have changed, my employer just issued me a 90 notice of the end of my employment and I am in dire straits. Without a DL now I am cooked so to speak. I have been a law abiding citizen and I have no issues now. When I recieved the revocation it was because of two back to back DUI's. I offer no excuses for it but I was going thru a tough time, no excuses. I should have known better but I did what I did and that is that. I need help - PLEASE. I am limited in my options now with the work situation. I need the DL or I fear I will be homeless if I am prevented from driving. Not an issue before but now it is a major issue. I need help. Can you ? PLEASE - I am not a person to beg for help but right now, If I do not get help I am cooked. I am begging you for help here. PLEASE. I do not know what else to say. Please consider or I am living on the street in 3 months. I may be any ways but at least I have more options. Regards, Louis Claude

Good Afternoon everyone.  I have finally spoke with Mr. Holley.  He was just concerned with the cost of his outstanding citations.  He stated he had gotten did prices every time he had called or went to the clerk of court so I called each one and asked what were the cost for him and mailed him a copy of his outstanding fines.  I also explained to him that once the fines were taken care of he could request a hearing or on 1/27/2010 he would be eligible for his license as long as there were no more convictions.  He was content with everything I had assisted him with.  I also told him if he had any further questions to please feel free to contact me.
Have a great weekend.
Thanks,
J.S. Mitchell

Subject: Jose C Chavez Hernandez / PDPS Hit

Good Afternoon Mr. Walston;

I'm writing to you in regards of Mr. Jose C Chavez Hernandez, born on 3/10/81, and his eligibility status on the National Registry (PDPS). The State of North Carolina shows on the National Registry (PDPS) that Mr. Jose Hernandez, born on 3/10/81, is not eligible for driver's license.

Mr. Jose C Chavez Hernandez, born on 3/10/81, has held a driver's license from the State of Maryland since 7/11/03; however, in order to obtain another driver's license in Maryland, Mr. Chavez Hernandez has to present a "Clearance Letter" or "No Match Letter" from North Carolina because of the PDPS hit. 

Mr. Chavez Hernandez has been at Glenmont several times concerning this problem. He stated that he has been calling the number we gave him from PDPS without success. He has been given several different phone numbers, spent several hours on the phone, and still has not been able to solve this issue.

The Letter of Clearance or No-Match can be faxed to my office at 410-792-0172.

Should you need any more information regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.
