Monday



* As the first order of business as Governor, Bev Perdue signed <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>a series of change orders during a ceremony in her office.  Those executive orders will help make government operate with more transparency and efficiency.

Thursday



* The Office of State Management and Budget estimated a budget shortfall of approximately $2 billion.  To help meet that challenge, Governor Perdue signed <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=22>an executive order that called for a reduction in state agency budgets and freezes on hiring, state purchases on goods and services and limits on travel.  Importantly, Governor Perdue placed an emphasis on protecting vital services such as education, health care and public safety.
