Fighting for North Carolina Jobs


Governor Perdue was one of four governors to participate in a panel at the U.S. House Democratic Caucus Issues Conference in Williamsburg, Va. on Friday.

Her message was heard loud and clear: “pass the stimulus package without delay, with as few restrictions as possible, and do not delay distribution of the funds.  We must put that money, and our people, to work now.”

New York Governor David Paterson, Ohio Governor Ted Strickland and Colorado Governor Bill Ritter also participated in the conference.

Governor Perdue continues to fight for North Carolina’s needs in Washington.  In January, she traveled to Washington, DC to meet with North Carolina’s Congressional delegation and then President-elect Obama’s Transition to discuss the federal stimulus package.  In December, she met with the 50 state governors and then President-elect Obama in Philadelphia.


On-Site Accountability at the Employment Security Commission


Friday afternoon Governor Perdue made an unannounced visit to the JobLink Career Center at the Employment Security Commission office in Raleigh.  She spoke to employees, toured the facility and asked questions of the citizens who were there receiving services.

Gov. Perdue was specifically looking for indications that the Career Center was providing the types of services needed by today’s unemployed. She focused on the hours the Center is open, how many staff and partner agencies are available and what kinds of diverse services are provided, and whether the Center has been able to change to meet growing demand.

The visit was a follow up on Gov. Perdue’s pledge to make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies across North Carolina. Her first such visit was to Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro two weeks ago.

“I heard the real stories behind the numbers – I met people who had lost jobs due to this troubled economy, of course, but I also saw so much more.  I met someone who holds a PhD but can’t find a job. I talked to job seekers who are former military and are looking for a career outside the armed forces. I saw a woman who had never held a job before but today is looking for a new path. These are real people we must work for, not just statistics. I want every single ESC office in North Carolina to be operating as efficiently and effectively as possible to best serve these citizens.”

Did she go to the grocery store and see who had food stamps or go to the druggist and see who was using the Medicaid (young Mexicans) or did she go to the nursery to see who was getting free nursery or go to the hospital to see who got free everything from the hospital. I DOUBT VERY SERIOUSLY THAT SHE DID.

Gov. Perdue;
I have been advising Dr. Ghasem Shahbazi, Director of Biological
Engineering at NC A&T University.
Dr Shahbazi is researching the use of the weed Cattail to produce ethanol
as a renewable energy.
His project is on the right track, not only to produce ethanol, but will
also develop many jobs.
I am considered the Grandfather of the cattail research and it is successful.
Your office should provide Dr. Shahbazi with the assistance he needs.
Take a good look at what he is doing.
Respectfully;
James Brannigan

There is so much "PORK" in his "SPENDING" bill that we could feed the whole world BBQ for a year, this is not what we need. In my opinion everything Obama has done so far is wrong. Now he wants us smokers to pay for socialized medicine for illegals.  I don't think I can ever vote Democratic again

Bev,



You can start by returning the collected Sales Tax to Charlotte.  As a life-time Democrat I expect you to follow through with your campaign promises. 



When Ronald Reagan was Governor of CA he passed costs of State programs to the local communities. This was his way of reducing the State debt and now look at their deficit.  You can begin by just cutting State Employees and Programs that do nothing.  The Department of Insurance would be a good place to start

Fighting for North Carolina Jobs



Governor Perdue was one of four governors to participate in a panel at the U.S. House Democratic Caucus Issues Conference in Williamsburg, Va. on Friday.



Her message was heard loud and clear: “pass the stimulus package without delay, with as few restrictions as possible, and do not delay distribution of the funds.  We must put that money, and our people, to work now.”



New York Governor David Paterson, Ohio Governor Ted Strickland and Colorado Governor Bill Ritter also participated in the conference.



Governor Perdue continues to fight for North Carolina’s needs in Washington.  In January, she traveled to Washington, DC to meet with North Carolina’s Congressional delegation and then President-elect Obama’s Transition to discuss the federal stimulus package.  In December, she met with the 50 state governors and then President-elect Obama in Philadelphia.



On-Site Accountability at the Employment Security Commission



Friday afternoon Governor Perdue made an unannounced visit to the JobLink Career Center at the Employment Security Commission office in Raleigh.  She spoke to employees, toured the facility and asked questions of the citizens who were there receiving services.



Gov. Perdue was specifically looking for indications that the Career Center was providing the types of services needed by today’s unemployed. She focused on the hours the Center is open, how many staff and partner agencies are available and what kinds of diverse services are provided, and whether the Center has been able to change to meet growing demand.



The visit was a follow up on Gov. Perdue’s pledge to make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies across North Carolina. Her first such visit was to Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro two weeks ago.



“I heard the real stories behind the numbers – I met people who had lost jobs due to this troubled economy, of course, but I also saw so much more.  I met someone who holds a PhD but can’t find a job. I talked to job seekers who are former military and are looking for a career outside the armed forces. I saw a woman who had never held a job before but today is looking for a new path.

I cannot see this being too much of a stimulus to our economy! Why don't we look at having lenders re-write all mortgage loans on their books at 3% since the gov't is willing to loan banks at 0-1%. This would cut most mortgage payments in half! This should allow almost all home owners to pay their mortgage payment and pay it on time. It cleans up the baks books. It will free up much needed cash from the home owners to spend in the community, invest, and save. The housing market will stabalize and the foreclosure would slow down drastically. This would also not cost the tax payers trillions that we feel will never get paid back or reach the people anyways! The banks still make positive cash flow (2%) and the gov't makes (1%) immediately. You want to fight for jobs, I would put my plan up against the stimulus package and your job!

I hope the current stimulus package keeps getting rejected until more common sense can be considered.

Thank you for hopefully listening!

          Fighting for North Carolina
Jobs

             Governor Perdue was one of four governors to participate in
a panel at the
             U.S. House Democratic Caucus Issues Conference in
Williamsburg,
            Va. on
            Friday.

            Her message was heard loud and clear:
            â€œpass the stimulus package without delay, with as few
             restrictions as possible, and do not delay distribution of
the
            funds.  We must put that money, and our people, to work
            now.â€

            New York Governor David Paterson, Ohio Governor
             Ted Strickland and Colorado Governor Bill Ritter also=2

participated
            in the conference.

            Governor Perdue continues to fight for North
             Carolinaâ€™s needs in Washington.  In January, she traveled
to
            Washington, DC to meet with North Carolinaâ€™s Congressional
             delegation and then President-elect Obamaâ€™s Transition to
discuss
             the federal stimulus package.  In December, she met with
the 50
            state governors and then President-elect Obama in
            Philadelphia.

            Employment Security Commission
             Friday
            afternoon Governor Perdue made an unannounced visit to
             the JobLink Career Center at the Employment Security
Commission
             office in Raleigh.  She spoke to employees, toured the
facility
             and asked questions of the citizens who were there
receiving
            services.

             Gov. Perdue was specifically looking for indications that
the
             Career Center was providing the types of services needed by=2

todayâ€™s
             unemployed. She focused on the hours the Center is open,
how many
             staff and partner agencies are available and what kinds of
diverse
             services are provided, and whether the Center has been able
to
            change to meet growing demand.

            The visit was a follow up on Gov. Perdueâ€™s pledge to make
             on-site accountability inspections of state agencies across
North
             Carolina. Her first such visit was to Cherry Hospital in
Goldsboro
            two weeks ago.

            â€œI heard the real
             stories behind the numbers â€“ I met people who had lost jobs
due to
             this troubled economy, of course, but I also saw so much
more.  I met someone who holds a
             PhD but canâ€™t find a job. I talked to job seekers who are
former
             military and are looking for a career outside the armed
forces. I
             saw a woman who had never held a job before but today is
looking for
             a new path. These are real people we must work for, not
just
  20          statistics. I want every single ESC office in North
Carolina to be
             operating as efficiently and effectively as possible to
best serve
            these citizens.â€

  l'm sorry l see this is twice you have totally missed my point. I had sent this email in reference to the fact that North Carolina is almost the absolute worst state in the union concerning  the backlog of disability claims. To my misfortune  l am no longer able to hold down a job and its been 19 months now that l have had no income. I have never in my life asked the state of North Carolina nor anyone else for anything.  l have worked in this state for 40 years. Unfortunately l am not able to work and forced to ask for state disability, which is the only reason l emailed the governor in the first place. 
    It is now quite obvious  to me that this  is of absolute no concern of the governor.   Due to the fact that l am a good christian as well as an honest citizen, l will say thanks,  for nothing !

WHY did you set up a process for unsubscribing that does not work?  I gave money via Emily's List, but do not wish to receive continuing messages from you.

Is there anyone out there listening?

Fighting for North Carolina Jobs


Governor Perdue was one of four governors to participate in a panel at the U.S. House Democratic Caucus Issues Conference in Williamsburg, Va. on Friday.

Her message was heard loud and clear: “pass the stimulus package without delay, with as few restrictions as possible, and do not delay distribution of the funds.  We must put that money, and our people, to work now.”

New York Governor David Paterson, Ohio Governor Ted Strickland and Colorado Governor Bill Ritter also participated in the conference.

Governor Perdue continues to fight for North Carolina’s needs in Washington.  In January, she traveled to Washington, DC to meet with North Carolina’s Congressional delegation and then President-elect Obama’s Transition to discuss the federal stimulus package.  In December, she met with the 50 state governors and then President-elect Obama in Philadelphia.


On-Site Accountability at the Employment Security Commission


Friday afternoon Governor Perdue made an unannounced visit to the JobLink Career Center at the Employment Security Commission office in Raleigh.  She spoke to employees, toured the facility and asked questions of the citizens who were there receiving services.

Gov. Perdue was specifically looking for indications that the Career Center was providing the types of services needed by today’s unemployed. She focused on the hours the Center is open, how many staff and partner agencies are available and what kinds of diverse services are provided, and whether the Center has been able to change to meet growing demand.

The visit was a follow up on Gov. Perdue’s pledge to make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies across North Carolina. Her first such visit was to Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro two weeks ago.

“I heard the real stories behind the numbers – I met people who had lost jobs due to this troubled economy, of course, but I also saw so much more.  I met someone who holds a PhD but can’t find a job. I talked to job seekers who are former military and are looking for a career outside the armed forces. I saw a woman who had never held a job before but today is looking for a new path. These are real people we must work for, not just statistics. I want every single ESC office in North Carolina to be operating as efficiently and effectively as possible to best serve these citizens.”

I think you should check out the legal system of each county and see how they are spending tax payer dollars. Putting someone in prison for 6 days for shoplifting an item worth only 12.96 should be a criminal offense in itself.

Hello Gov. Perdue –



     If you really want to help the regular working people of North Carolina, then take the initiative to get the laws of North Carolina changed so that all workers of North Carolina have the right to form unions for the purpose of collective bargaining with their employers.  That is the American way, and it should be the North Carolina way.  We workers voted for you with the expectation that you would have the courage to fight for all of us.  If you fail us, you will fail yourself – and all the people of North Carolina.



                         Sincerely yours,



                         James H. Dautremont

                         Greenville, North Carolina

	The problem is the so called stimulus bill contains hundreds of billions of dollars of non stimulus spending. Let's not be so irresponsible with our money because when our taxes are increased to repay all the money that will be barrowed we should only be indebted for spending that is truly stimulative and not payoffs, special interest and purely ideological spending.

Take Care, Lewis.

We all, and I am sure other towns ,lost our jobs in 2002 because Abbott Labs was paid 40 plus million dollars to set up in Dominion Republic and Costa Rico. This closed down the Laurinburg plant. This does not include the wire plant and other companies that closed to move to Mexico, China, and other countries for cheap labor. Yet, we the Americans have lost our jobs and still have to pay top dollar for everything we purchase.
So, tell me who is going to lobby for us and bring the jobs back to America. We still have immigrants coming in and being added to our social services and the low income retirees cannot get any help after they worked and paid taxes for 30 plus years.
I was born in this country in 1944 my parents and I , plus my husband born in 1939 and his parents have worked and paid taxes all these years plus thousands more yet we cannot get help and still have to pay taxes on our little extra income. This is a sick government that takes away and gives nothing back to the people that worked and paid their taxes!! Our government is so willing to help other countries and get our sons and daughters killed. When will the president and the government, democratic and republicans get it in gear and bring back the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN GOD WE TRUST!!
The only reason we are at this point is because God is being removed!
Wake up America if you remove GOD you have nothing!
Sincerely,
A 65 year old American,
Betty Cooper Reese

Fighting for North Carolina Jobs


Governor Perdue was one of four governors to participate in a panel at the U.S. House Democratic Caucus Issues Conference in Williamsburg, Va. on Friday.

Her message was heard loud and clear: “pass the stimulus package without delay, with as few restrictions as possible, and do not delay distribution of the funds.  We must put that money, and our people, to work now.”

New York Governor David Paterson, Ohio Governor Ted Strickland and Colorado Governor Bill Ritter also participated in the conference.

Governor Perdue continues to fight for North Carolina’s needs in Washington.  In January, she traveled to Washington, DC to meet with North Carolina’s Congressional delegation and then President-elect Obama’s Transition to discuss the federal stimulus package.  In December, she met with the 50 state governors and then President-elect Obama in Philadelphia.


On-Site Accountability at the Employment Security Commission


Friday afternoon Governor Perdue made an unannounced visit to the JobLink Career Center at the Employment Security Commission office in Raleigh.  She spoke to employees, toured the facility and asked questions of the citizens who were there receiving services.

Gov. Perdue was specifically looking for indications that the Career Center was providing the types of services needed by today’s unemployed. She focused on the hours the Center is open, how many staff and partner agencies are available and what kinds of diverse services are provided, and whether the Center has been able to change to meet growing demand.

The visit was a follow up on Gov. Perdue’s pledge to make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies across North Carolina. Her first such visit was to Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro two weeks ago.

“I heard the real stories behind the numbers – I met people who had lost jobs due to this troubled economy, of course, but I also saw so much more.  I met someone who holds a PhD but can’t find a job. I talked to job seekers who are former military and are looking for a career outside the armed forces. I saw a woman who had never held a job before but today is looking for a new path. These are real people we must work for, not just statistics. I want every single ESC office in North Carolina to be operating as efficiently and effectively as possible to best serve these citizens.”

.Dear Governor Perdue:  In view of your interest in jobs protection, I am sending you a summary of a study I spearheaded that summarizes the “Green jobs” situation and potential for new jobs in your state, North Carolina.  The study summarized then existing “green jobs” is North Carolina and made extensive policy recommendations for creating additional employment through existing programs—little new spending, many new jobs.  Complete study is available from Management Information Services (MISI), at <http://www.misi-net.com/>www.misi-net.com (Publications, Jobs and Environment Initiative.  Also attached is a recent study done by MISI for the state of Colorado.



I strongly urge you to contact Roger Bezdek, Ph.D., principal at MISI, who has long studied the employment potential of environmental investments.  He is reachable at 703-620-4120.



My best wishes.  I would also be glad to speak with you about the Chicago Climate Exchange at your convenience which may also help your state address energy efficiency and emissions in a turn-key “one stop shopping” manner.



Kind regards,

   Gladly, it appears we have a new gal on the block that really does care about what she does to help us - the citizens of North Carolina. And that's a die-hard republican that just said that!

   Thanks Governor Perdue for caring and for your actions too.

Truly,

Dear Governor:
The ROOT CAUSE of the Economic Problem is mainly due to Greedy Selfish Wall Street Investors and due to shady loan deals by Fanny Mae & Freddie Mac.
My humble request is to BAN Margins, Derivatives, Options and Futures at least for a year, if not permanently. This will prevent the destruction of companies like Nortel, previously Lucent etc., and also the stocks.
Please take necessary action in this regard.
Respectfully
Ram Bashyam

Fighting for North Carolina Jobs


Governor Perdue was one of four governors to participate in a panel at the U.S. House Democratic Caucus Issues Conference in Williamsburg, Va. on Friday.

Her message was heard loud and clear: “pass the stimulus package without delay, with as few restrictions as possible, and do not delay distribution of the funds.  We must put that money, and our people, to work now.”

New York Governor David Paterson, Ohio Governor Ted Strickland and Colorado Governor Bill Ritter also participated in the conference.

Governor Perdue continues to fight for North Carolina’s needs in Washington.  In January, she traveled to Washington, DC to meet with North Carolina’s Congressional delegation and then President-elect Obama’s Transition to discuss the federal stimulus package.  In December, she met with the 50 state governors and then President-elect Obama in Philadelphia.


On-Site Accountability at the Employment Security Commission


Friday afternoon Governor Perdue made an unannounced visit to the JobLink Career Center at the Employment Security Commission office in Raleigh.  She spoke to employees, toured the facility and asked questions of the citizens who were there receiving services.

Gov. Perdue was specifically looking for indications that the Career Center was providing the types of services needed by today’s unemployed. She focused on the hours the Center is open, how many staff and partner agencies are available and what kinds of diverse services are provided, and whether the Center has been able to change to meet growing demand.

The visit was a follow up on Gov. Perdue’s pledge to make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies across North Carolina. Her first such visit was to Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro two weeks ago.

“I heard the real stories behind the numbers – I met people who had lost jobs due to this troubled economy, of course, but I also saw so much more.  I met someone who holds a PhD but can’t find a job. I talked to job seekers who are former military and are looking for a career outside the armed forces. I saw a woman who had never held a job before but today is looking for a new path. These are real people we must work for, not just statistics. I want every single ESC office in North Carolina to be operating as efficiently and effectively as possible to best serve these citizens.”

Governor

This makes me very unhappy knowing that my Governor supports such garbage.  I will not vote for you during the next election because if you support this legislation you are corrupt.

Dear Governor,
I do not agree that the "PORK FILLED STIMULUS SHOULD BE PASSED>
Government spending does not create long lasting jobs.  Give the people and small business tax releif, and the jobs you want for North Carolina will come and be long lasting.
Sincerely,
Don & Marilyn Kyle

Dear Governor Perdue:



We oppose the pending legislation regarding a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule of our Constitution and I ask that you oppose it.   This law would codify the legality of police lies and misconduct being sufficient to sustain what otherwise would be a violation of citizens constitutional rights.  It would be a giant step backward for law enforcement accountability and the inalienable and sacred constitutional rights of all NC citizens.   Thank you for your consideration.



We think you have been a wonderful legislator and that you are doing a great job as Governor.  Thank you for all your hard work for the people of NC!



Best wishes,





William & Trentity Gerrans

What about the needs of the people in NENC who do not want a OLF.??? When is the Governor going to step
up to the plate and support the community against the OLF.

Fighting for North Carolina Jobs

Governor Perdue was one of four governors to participate in a panel at the U.S. House Democratic Caucus Issues Conference in Williamsburg, Va. on Friday.
Her message was heard loud and clear: “pass the stimulus package without delay, with as few restrictions as possible, and do not delay distribution of the funds.  We must put that money, and our people, to work now.”
New York Governor David Paterson, Ohio Governor Ted Strickland and Colorado Governor Bill Ritter also participated in the conference.
Governor Perdue continues to fight for North Carolina’s needs in Washington.  In January, she traveled to Washington, DC to meet with North Carolina’s Congressional delegation and then President-elect Obama’s Transition to discuss the federal stimulus package.  In December, she met with the 50 state governors and then President-elect Obama in Philadelphia.

On-Site Accountability at the Employment Security Commission

Friday afternoon Governor Perdue made an unannounced visit to the JobLink Career Center at the Employment Security Commission office in Raleigh.  She spoke to employees, toured the facility and asked questions of the citizens who were there receiving services.
Gov. Perdue was specifically looking for indications that the Career Center was providing the types of services needed by today’s unemployed. She focused on the hours the Center is open, how many staff and partner agencies are available and what kinds of diverse services are provided, and whether the Center has been able to change to meet growing demand.
The visit was a follow up on Gov. Perdue’s pledge to make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies across North Carolina. Her first such visit was to Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro two weeks ago.
“I heard the real stories behind the numbers – I met people who had lost jobs due to this troubled economy, of course, but I also saw so much more.  I met someone who holds a PhD but can’t find a job. I talked to job seekers who are former military and are looking for a career outside the armed forces. I saw a woman who had never held a job before but today is looking for a new path. These are real people we must work for, not just statistics. I want every single ESC office in North Carolina to be operating as efficiently and effectively as possible to best serve these citizens.”

We totally agree and saw last night that NC is one of the worst states with Unemployment.  We have emailed our Senate Representatives and asked that they vote for the Stimulus Package.  We also emailed our House Representative and told him how disappointed we were that he voted against the Stimulus Package.

IMHO, perhaps it would be very wise for Governor Perdue to READ the plan in toto, and then perhaps she would re consider pushing to have it passed. Our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren will never be able to pay the debt our generation is heaping on them.
