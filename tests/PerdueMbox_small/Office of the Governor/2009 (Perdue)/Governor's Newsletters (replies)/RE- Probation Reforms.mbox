Governor Bev Purdue,



I think the idea of more strict policies on parolees is stupid. Money would be better served trying to help the people in jail/prison with better drug rehabilitation programs, job training, etc. Toughing the policies on the parolees will only be a waste of time. You can’t do the same thing over and over again and expect different results. The same holds true for repeat offenders. They are obviously repeating the same behaviors and falling back in to the same behaviors because they are not being helped to see a better way to conduct their lives. Parole officers should be doing their research on anyone on their case load no matter what. If they are not they are simply putting themselves in danger. I am adamantly opposed to creating stricter policies for parolees. That is like trying to put out a fire once the flames are already gone. You should invest money into helping with better programs for those in need while they are serving their time in our states facilities. This might actually constitute for change to occur in these people versus little to no rehabilitation for people who really need it. Most of these people have mental problems as well and that should be helped for the willing; during the incarceration period.


I will be happy to elaborate further…(910) 512-5399 or shannonmccrerylee@hotmail.com

Governor Perdue Proposes Changes to Strengthen Probation Supervision

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced a package of probation and parole initiatives that will improve our criminal justice system and strengthen public safety.  The budget and policy reforms will toughen probation conditions, make absconder information readily available, and improve access to information for law enforcement and probation officers.



“These reforms will hold offenders more accountable, ease officer caseloads and will reduce crime on the streets,” said Gov. Perdue.  “It will give probation and law enforcement officers more tools to do their jobs effectively.”        



“Probation officers need to know the history and needs of the offenders they are supervising,” said Correction Secretary Alvin Keller.  “Opening offender’s juvenile records to their supervising probation officers will help officers better protect themselves and the public, and help officers secure appropriate treatments and interventions for offenders.”

Halifax County to Add Manufacturer, 105 Jobs

FASTA Inc., an international producer of steel and foam construction panels, is opening its first manufacturing plant in Littleton.  The company plans to invest $2.5 million and create 105 jobs in Halifax County over the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $300,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.   



“North Carolina continues to attract manufacturing companies looking to tap into a top-ranked business climate and growing global opportunities,” Gov. Perdue said.  “These companies know the value of our skilled workforce and unparalleled quality of life.”



FASTA, or Foam and Steel Technology Associates Inc., is a Virginia-based manufacturer of pre-engineered steel panels and components for the international residential, commercial and institutional markets.  The company promotes “green” building practices for the design and construction of homes for the efficient use of energy, water and materials.  FASTA plans to open its first manufacturing facility in Littleton to produce steel panels and trusses.



The One North Carolina Fund provides financial assistance, through local governments, to attract business projects that will stimulate economic activity and create new jobs in the state.  Companies receive no money up front and must meet job creation and investment performance standards to qualify for grant funds.  All of these grants also require and are contingent upon local matches.



Through use of the One North Carolina Fund, more than 35,000 jobs and $6.5 billion in investment have been created since 2001.  Project partners include: the N.C. Departments of Commerce and Revenue, Halifax County, Town of Littleton and Halifax County Business Horizons.

Edgecombe County Manufacturer to Add 120 Jobs

HC Composites, a national manufacturer of twin-hull boats, plans to expand its Tarboro operations. The company will invest $2.65 million and create 120 jobs in the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $130,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.  



HC Composites, which does business as World Cat, manufactures a variety of catamaran fishing boats in Tarboro, where it has headquarters and employs 60 workers.  The company is purchasing Glacier Bay Catamarans of Seattle, which makes twin-hull cruising boats.  HC Composites plans to consolidate operations by relocating the Glacier Bay facility to Tarboro.



“The union of these two brands will provide incredible synergy and ability to serve our combined customers better.  We are extremely fortunate to have this opportunity and look forward to meeting all of the customers and dealers,” said Chris Brockway, president of Glacier Bay and a partner in the two firms’ parent company. “World Cat will stay a fishing boat that can cruise while Glacier Bay will continue being a cruising boat that can fish.”

State of the State

On Monday, Gov. Perdue delivered a candid assessment of the challenges North Carolina faces in the midst of the global economic crisis, and what the priorities and tough choices must be to move the state ahead.



Even in this troubled economic environment, Gov. Perdue said, she will focus on job creation and retention, retraining for those who have lost their jobs and investing in the public schools.  Gov. Perdue stressed education and said there will be increased funding for the work that goes on in public school classrooms.



“We must, as the saying goes, ‘not eat our seed corn,’ but continue to move forward on education to keep North Carolina competitive in the global marketplace,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Yes, even in these tough times we will increase per-pupil spending in our public schools.”



She called on the General Assembly, and all North Carolinians, to help address the state’s most urgent needs, focus on getting the economy moving again and bring accountability, transparency and efficiency to state government.

Attn: Carol Young – Can you please make sure that Bev reads this?

Thanks so much.



Bev,



I trust that you are finding yourself right at home as our new Governor. I know you have envisioned yourself there for many years and it shows

On your face that you are exactly where God has intended you to be. Again, congratulations! We are blessed to have you in Raleigh working for our state.



I have some exciting news and wonderful opportunity! Do you remember when you and I were talking at your home about public school and you asked

Me the question:”Where is your child in school?” I responded that he was at Pollocksville Elementary School. I also shared with you that day that I believe the

Key to making it happen is parent involvement. Well, I had no idea that the seed of conversation that day would lead to this email.



Just a few months ago, I felt led to get more involved in my son’s school. I spoke with Joanne Stone, the principal of our school, and proposed the idea of starting

a leadership class in my son’s classroom. I am using the book “Inch and Miles – A journey to Success” by Coach John Wooden and we are having a ball

learning about the building blocks to success by studying this book. I have a class of 10 that I work with each Thursday morning. Just this past week, we did the PTO program

for the parents and I was so delighted to see the children’s excitement and growth as they shared what they have been learning. We are actually building a

Pyramid to Success with blocks so they have a visual in their room of what it takes to be successful.

I have to admit that I was always asking the school what they “needed” from me. Instead, I decided to bring to the school my passion and share with these

Precious children. I have been so blessed by this experience and want to continue to share and help others in our community see how they can “partner” with the school

And bring their passion and gifts.



As a way to celebrate these children, I really want to do something special at the end of the school year. I spoke with Bob Mattocks about perhaps bringing a

NC STATE basketball player in to speak with the children, but due to spring basketball schedules, it would be a tough thing to line up.

So, then I began to think about who would be perfect to come and share with these children. Just last night, it came to me.

YOU, BEVERLY PERDUE, The FIRST WOMAN GOVERNOR! A woman who loves the public school system and it is a passion for you.



So, I am asking you to consider coming for a visit to Pollocksville to attend our Awards Day in June. I will get back with you on the exact date, however, it is

Usually a couple of days before school gets out.

I know these children and our community would be so blessed by your commitment to join us.



And, to top it all off, we would treat you to a great lunch at the Trent Restaurant – the “local hotspot” for these great folks in Pollocksville.



Look forward to hearing from you.

Governor Perdue Proposes Changes to Strengthen Probation Supervision

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced a package of probation and parole initiatives that will improve our criminal justice system and strengthen public safety.  The budget and policy reforms will toughen probation conditions, make absconder information readily available, and improve access to information for law enforcement and probation officers.



“These reforms will hold offenders more accountable, ease officer caseloads and will reduce crime on the streets,” said Gov. Perdue.  “It will give probation and law enforcement officers more tools to do their jobs effectively.”        



“Probation officers need to know the history and needs of the offenders they are supervising,” said Correction Secretary Alvin Keller.  “Opening offender’s juvenile records to their supervising probation officers will help officers better protect themselves and the public, and help officers secure appropriate treatments and interventions for offenders.”

Halifax County to Add Manufacturer, 105 Jobs

FASTA Inc., an international producer of steel and foam construction panels, is opening its first manufacturing plant in Littleton.  The company plans to invest $2.5 million and create 105 jobs in Halifax County over the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $300,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.   



“North Carolina continues to attract manufacturing companies looking to tap into a top-ranked business climate and growing global opportunities,” Gov. Perdue said.  “These companies know the value of our skilled workforce and unparalleled quality of life.”



FASTA, or Foam and Steel Technology Associates Inc., is a Virginia-based manufacturer of pre-engineered steel panels and components for the international residential, commercial and institutional markets.  The company promotes “green” building practices for the design and construction of homes for the efficient use of energy, water and materials.  FASTA plans to open its first manufacturing facility in Littleton to produce steel panels and trusses.



The One North Carolina Fund provides financial assistance, through local governments, to attract business projects that will stimulate economic activity and create new jobs in the state.  Companies receive no money up front and must meet job creation and investment performance standards to qualify for grant funds.  All of these grants also require and are contingent upon local matches.



Through use of the One North Carolina Fund, more than 35,000 jobs and $6.5 billion in investment have been created since 2001.  Project partners include: the N.C. Departments of Commerce and Revenue, Halifax County, Town of Littleton and Halifax County Business Horizons.

State of the State

Even in this troubled economic environment, Gov. Perdue said, she will focus on job creation and retention, retraining for those who have lost their jobs and investing in the public schools.  Gov. Perdue stressed education and said there will be increased funding for the work that goes on in public school classrooms.



“We must, as the saying goes, ‘not eat our seed corn,’ but continue to move forward on education to keep North Carolina competitive in the global marketplace,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Yes, even in these tough times we will increase per-pupil spending in our public schools.”



She called on the General Assembly, and all North Carolinians, to help address the state’s most urgent needs, focus on getting the economy moving again and bring accountability, transparency and efficiency to state government.

I hope the governor will find time to attend the celebration of the first Vietnam Veterans day on March 28 at the Elks Club, 12 to 4 p.m., in Raleigh.  We hope, at least, that she will issue a proclamation commemorating this event.

Gov. Perdue- Thanks for visiting with us in Western NC the past few days.  We even brought out a bear to make the trip more memorable.  I regret that I missed several events you attended, but had legal business that required my attention and presence. 

You are getting off to such a wonderful start as our Governor.  I hate that the financial times are so difficult, but perhaps in your 2nd term, we can return to initiating new progressive programs that cost $ in NC.  I left a brochure with some ideas on ridge top and steep slope protection laws.  I hope you can support these when/if they go through the General Assembly.  We intend to strengthen our County laws on the subject, but I believe a statewide minimum is necessary before the mountains are completely overdeveloped (and less attractive for tourism and retirement).  Your newsletter is very good and informative.

I was inspired by your promise to put all state contract and RFPs on line for everyone to see and review.  Transparency is so important to keeping citizen confidence in government.  I intend to propose a similar local ordinance for this openness.

Let me know if I can ever assist you in any manner.  I am a big Perdue fan.  Keep up the fantastic work.  Economic times will improve and NC should be positioned with an educated work force and job creation when the boom times return.

The State of North Carolina received an additional $336 million in federal funds for the Medicaid Program from the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  These funds will assist North Carolina in addressing the budget shortfall for the current fiscal year.  The initial amount received covers the months of October 2008 – February 2009.


Edgecombe County Manufacturer to Add 120 Jobs

HC Composites, a national manufacturer of twin-hull boats, plans to expand its Tarboro operations. The company will invest $2.65 million and create 120 jobs in the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $130,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.  

HC Composites, which does business as World Cat, manufactures a variety of catamaran fishing boats in Tarboro, where it has headquarters and employs 60 workers.  The company is purchasing Glacier Bay Catamarans of Seattle, which makes twin-hull cruising boats.  HC Composites plans to consolidate operations by relocating the Glacier Bay facility to Tarboro.

“The union of these two brands will provide incredible synergy and ability to serve our combined customers better.  We are extremely fortunate to have this opportunity and look forward to meeting all of the customers and dealers,” said Chris Brockway, president of Glacier Bay and a partner in the two firms’ parent company. “World Cat will stay a fishing boat that can cruise while Glacier Bay will continue being a cruising boat that can fish.”

State of the State

On Monday, Gov. Perdue delivered a candid assessment of the challenges North Carolina faces in the midst of the global economic crisis, and what the priorities and tough choices must be to move the state ahead.

Even in this troubled economic environment, Gov. Perdue said, she will focus on job creation and retention, retraining for those who have lost their jobs and investing in the public schools.  Gov. Perdue stressed education and said there will be increased funding for the work that goes on in public school classrooms.

“We must, as the saying goes, ‘not eat our seed corn,’ but continue to move forward on education to keep North Carolina competitive in the global marketplace,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Yes, even in these tough times we will increase per-pupil spending in our public schools.”

She called on the General Assembly, and all North Carolinians, to help address the state’s most urgent needs, focus on getting the economy moving again and bring accountability, transparency and efficiency to state government.

HOW PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL TURNED MILLIONAIRE INTO SLUMDOG IN CHARLOTTE

Ron A. Virmani, M.D.



On September 1, 1995, Presbyterian hospital called me to their imposing corporate Board Room in Charlotte, NC and dropped a bomb on me.  They said they were summarily suspending my hospital privileges at 4 PM that day!



Suspension from a hospital is a kiss of death for any physician!  Without hospital privileges, I could never deliver another baby nor help women in need of gynecologic surgery.  My future went blank in front of my eyes! 



I knew that they had been reviewing my charts for several months now.  But they never gave me a chance to explain my actions and defend my charts as required by hospitalâ€™s own by-laws.  This was truly a stab in the back. 



â€œWe do not have to tell you what the charts are.â€  Said then CEO of Presbyterian hospital Mr. Paul Betzold and chief of ob-gyn Dr. Ronald Brown.  They simply stated that I had 24 â€œproblematicâ€ charts, as determined by the peer review committee. 



Having migrated from India, I had received my M.D. from New Jersey Medical School in 1985 and finished my ob-gyn residency from Temple University hospital in 1989.  I had come to Charlotte in 1990 and become a member of Presbyterian hospital medical staff as an ob-gyn physician.



On December 1994, I had a surgical mishap.  Inadvertently, I punctured the external iliac artery in a patient during laparoscopy.  This was unfortunate but a known complication of such a procedure.  I immediately proceeded to laparotomy and summoned Dr. John Hollenbeck (general surgeon) and Dr. Scott Andrews (cardiovascular surgeon) to assist me.  We repaired the injury and the patient went home after a few days stay in the hospital.  My malpractice insurance company as well as several independent reviewers determined that I met the standard of care in this case.  However, citing business reasons, the insurance company later decided to settle the lawsuit for 300K.



Following the incident, Presbyterian hospital went on a fishing expedition of my charts from over a two year period.  Most of these charts had been filed in the hospital archives as having no quality of care issues.  Anyway, a departmental â€œpeer reviewâ€ committee headed by Dr. James Hardy nitpicked and labeled 24 of them â€œproblematicâ€ out of my 102 charts reviewed.



The Medical Board of North Carolina asked an experienced ob-gyn physician from Charlotte, Dr. Kenneth Chambers to review my cases.  He as well as several other reviewers found my charts to be within the standard of care. 



According to a letter circulated by Dr. Jared Schwartz in October 1998 among the hospitalâ€™s medical staff, I was the first physician to be suspended in 20 years at Presbyterian hospital!  Was it just a coincidence that I was the first ob-gyn physician of Indian origin at Presbyterian hospital?  I went to the local courts and dug up medical malpractice cases.  I found out the following facts, which are true to the best of my knowledge.



Dr. W. Wortman injured a patientâ€™s bladder at a laparoscopy.  The jury found him negligent and awarded the Plaintiff $100,000. (92-CVS-16674)



Dr. Kenneth Baker performed a laparscopic surgery in October 1993 at Union Memorial Hospital.  An injury to the intestine was not recognized at this time.  Patient presented later with abdominal abscess and died.  (Union County 95 CVS 01325) Dr. Baker performed another laparoscopy in November 1994 at which time a bowel perforation was not recognized.  She died of sepsis.  (Union County, 96 CVS 00992)  Presbyterian hospital had no problem subsequently giving Dr. Baker privileges in ob-gyn department.



Dr. Whitesides performed a laser laparoscopy on a patient in 1995 (99- CVS-5141).  The patient complained of abdominal pain on December 2 and 3, the physician prescribed stool softener.  On December 4, she passed out and the husband had to carry her.  An exploratory laparotomy and hemicolectomy was done.  Suit also named Nalle clinic.



Dr. C. Ellington performed a laser laparoscopy in September 1991 on a patient and perforated her small bowel.  She underwent multiple subsequent surgeries and became unable to eat and drink.  She was placed on TPN (intravenous nutrition).  The suit also named Bradford Clinic and PHAC.  (94-CVS-11679)



Dr. John Tidwell performed a laparoscopy on a patient who died from overwhelming sepsis six days later.  (97-CVS-1707)  Dr. Tidwell also failed to respond to nurseâ€™s pages for another patient in labor in August 1989.  The infant suffered severe physical and neurological injuries.  (92-CVS-11209)



Dr. A J Lewis failed to manage fetal distress during labor in 1992, the parties named (Dr. Lewis and Mintview ob-gyn) settled for $5M in May 1995.



Drs. M. Torres and K Stephens were performing a hysterectomy at Presbyterian hospital, while managing a labor patient at Carolinas Medical Center in September 1995.  They failed to respond to fetal distress in time.  The baby was born with zero apgars and died 16 hours after birth.(96-CVS-9576)



Dr. W. McDonald failed to assess fetal distress in February 1987.  The result was severe physical and neurological injuries.  (96-CVS-7927).



Dr. Alice Teague delayed performing a c/section after unsuccessful vacuum extraction of a baby with much fundal pressure.  The baby was born with birth asphyxia and skull fracture.  The jury awarded Plaintiff 23.2 million.  The hospital settled separately for $6M.  (95-CVS-13212)



These cases are only the tip of the iceberg of adverse events involving Presbyterian physicians.  I know of no disciplinary action against these physicians by the hospital.  They kept on practicing at Presbyterian hospital.  Some are still there.  In fact, some of them sat in my judgment. 



In 1996, I filed a state court case for breach of the by-laws.  The hospital started a new review, ordered by the court, using outside reviewers, but then suppressed their findings!  They started yet another internal review, which found 25 of my charts to be problematic.  However, 10 of these charts were different from the original 24 charts! 



In 1998, after the letter from Dr. Schwartz circulated, I realized that I was targeted because of ethnic prejudice.  In January 1999, I filed a discrimination case in the federal court.  The hospital attorneys dragged the case for so long that the original judge died.  A new judge was assigned. 



However, out of nowhere, Judge Mullen, apparently sympathetic to the hospital, appeared and grabbed the case form the new judge.  He kicked out my federal lawsuit stating that I should have pleaded discrimination in the original state court case in 1996!  At that time, I had no evidence of  discrimination!  So much for spending eleven long years in the courts and a million dollars in legal fees!  My career has been destroyed for ever!



Even though North Carolina Medical Board found my cases meeting the standard of care and said they would help me, they never did.  All national, state, local medical organizations and leaders in the community have stood on the sidelines watching the travesty of justice.  The peer review was a complete sham!



After I filed a suit alleging discrimination, Presbyterian hospital became sensitized to the issue of diversity.  They made alliance with Charlotte Medical Society, made up of African-American and minority doctors.  They started sending their employees to diversity workshops.  But they do not even think about rehabilitating my destroyed career and life!  Damn the Indian!  I have struggled with my sweat and blood for 13 years and become a martyr just like Dr. M.L.K. Jr.  I am left in the dust, over which the hospital is proclaiming its newfound love for diversity, rewarding many other minority physicians but continuing to completely ignore me.



In this state and the country, an undercurrent of racism exists in the medical field.  Bad physicians of the politically correct persuasions are allowed to practice based on their clout.  Good physicians, who are not part of the â€œgood old boys clubâ€ and not approved by the powers that be, are disciplined and thrown to dogs.  The â€œpeer reviewâ€ system is used by the physicians to protect their own and destroy the disenfranchised.  This does not bode well for the health care of the citizens of this country.

Governor Perdue Proposes Changes to Strengthen Probation Supervision

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced a package of probation and parole initiatives that will improve our criminal justice system and strengthen public safety.  The budget and policy reforms will toughen probation conditions, make absconder information readily available, and improve access to information for law enforcement and probation officers.

â€œThese reforms will hold offenders more accountable, ease officer caseloads and will reduce crime on the streets,â€ said Gov. Perdue.  â€œIt will give probation and law enforcement officers more tools to do their jobs effectively.â€        

â€œProbation officers need to know the history and needs of the offenders they are supervising,â€ said Correction Secretary Alvin Keller.  â€œOpening offenderâ€™s juvenile records to their supervising probation officers will help officers better protect themselves and the public, and help officers secure appropriate treatments and interventions for offenders.â€

On Friday of this week it was announced that Gov. Perdue would be using the lottery money for projects other than for the education system.  the lottery was set up solely for education it should not be used for anything else. I buy the tickets only because it is being used for this purpose. There are poor school districts that desperately need the money for physical repairs and for all the states schools educational enhancements.
Find some other source of revenue for the needed projects and keep up the good work you are doing.  It is good to see a hard working governor and pretty too.

Governor,

I am sending a copy of the email under separate cover that I sent to Commissioner Goodwin.  He has taken a courageous stand for reform in the insurance coastal insurance and beach plan.  I encourage you to support him. 

Without needed change, the market for homeowner’s insurance in NC will continue to erode and could get scarce.  

Thanks.

Dear Governor Perdue,
I am a Music (K-8) teacher and I know how the budget has to be cut on things. However, I am begging you to please hold the Arts to the Highest of your agenda.
The reason I am stating this is because Music in K-12 teaches students more than music. I teach cross currilum in my room. Music is Math, Music is History, Music is Science, and the list goes on....
I know that these are hard times and I suggested to Mo Green, Superintendent of Guilford County that I became a Music Teacher because I was a "drop out" waiting to happen until my music teacher saw something in me that no one else did..Not even my parents...
I am the only one in my entire family that is an educatior and I am proud of it. I suggested to him that the ABC/AYP bonus that all teachers get if the school passes; not to give them out.
I became a teacher not to become rich or because of the bonuses but, because I LOVE TEACHING STUDENTS. And I would rather keep my job than have a bonus. Of course, that is just one teacher letting you know that I am in teaching for the kids...to see them dream big....or dream small but, the important thing is that they have a dream and stick to the course and see their dreams come true. (That is what I tell my students)
I beleive it will all my heart and soul. Because I am one of those students that had a bad childhood that would make you think..."This kid is going to jail" because my father beat all of my family throughout my childhood years.
But, my music teacher, saw the love for music in my soul, and encouraged me to keep on keeping on...and my dreams finally came through.
I put myself through college while working full time sometimes a full time job and a part time job while going to college full time. Yes, it sounds hard to beleive but, I was determined not to fail. In fact, failure wasn't even a factor..I wanted to become a music teacher to touch lives...
So, please don't cut the Arts...Thank you so much for your time and consideration on this matter.
If you would like to contact me, I would be honored and happy to discuss the above with you.
Musically Yours,
Mr. Gregory W. Heath
Choral/Music Teacher K-8
Johnson Street Global Studies

Governor Perdue Proposes Changes to Strengthen Probation Supervision

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced a package of probation and parole initiatives that will improve our criminal justice system and strengthen public safety.  The budget and policy reforms will toughen probation conditions, make absconder information readily available, and improve access to information for law enforcement and probation officers.

“These reforms will hold offenders more accountable, ease officer caseloads and will reduce crime on the streets,” said Gov. Perdue.  “It will give probation and law enforcement officers more tools to do their jobs effectively.”        

“Probation officers need to know the history and needs of the offenders they are supervising,” said Correction Secretary Alvin Keller.  “Opening offender’s juvenile records to their supervising probation officers will help officers better protect themselves and the public, and help officers secure appropriate treatments and interventions for offenders.”

Halifax County to Add Manufacturer, 105 Jobs

FASTA Inc., an international producer of steel and foam construction panels, is opening its first manufacturing plant in Littleton.  The company plans to invest $2.5 million and create 105 jobs in Halifax County over the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $300,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.   

“North Carolina continues to attract manufacturing companies looking to tap into a top-ranked business climate and growing global opportunities,” Gov. Perdue said.  “These companies know the value of our skilled workforce and unparalleled quality of life.”

FASTA, or Foam and Steel Technology Associates Inc., is a Virginia-based manufacturer of pre-engineered steel panels and components for the international residential, commercial and institutional markets.  The company promotes “green” building practices for the design and construction of homes for the efficient use of energy, water and materials.  FASTA plans to open its first manufacturing facility in Littleton to produce steel panels and trusses.

The One North Carolina Fund provides financial assistance, through local governments, to attract business projects that will stimulate economic activity and create new jobs in the state.  Companies receive no money up front and must meet job creation and investment performance standards to qualify for grant funds.  All of these grants also require and are contingent upon local matches.

Through use of the One North Carolina Fund, more than 35,000 jobs and $6.5 billion in investment have been created since 2001.  Project partners include: the N.C. Departments of Commerce and Revenue, Halifax County, Town of Littleton and Halifax County Business Horizons.

Note to Governor Beverly Perdue

Have you ever seen a governor with angel's wings?  GO LOOK IN THE MIRROR!

Strengthening probation supervision makes sleeping easier for me.  I
have been meaning to write you re the denial of probation to Kenneth
Stevens, the man who held a gun to my husband's head and shot him three
times.  KS and his "buddies" who formed an extortion group had
threatened the lives of myelf and my daughter if my husband didn't pay
them and when all his money ran out they killed him.  Our District
Attorney (I can't even mention his name without losing my breath) let
him plea second degree but the wonderful judge (female, of course) gave
him life.  The problem with that, though, is that after ten years (It
has been fifteen now) he became eligible for parole since he'd been
tried for second rather than first degree murder.  The letter I just
received with your name at the top stated that he did not get partrol,
which means my daughter and I are safe for another two years, at least.
Of course, as the prisons fill up there's always the chance that some
are allowed to leave to make more room for others.  This man was allowed
to go to welding school for two years (paid for, of course, with
tax-payers' money) and then said he didn't like it and they let him
begin a computer course.  That lasted only a few months because he
didn't have the capacity to learn, I suppose, and now all he does is
wander around.  What happened to what we used to call "chain-gangs?"
People who kill other people, especially in sadistic ways, should at
least have to WORK.  Without the chains on their ankles, of course,
we've had those who manage to escape.  I feel that if our laws were more
strictly imposed and prison, itself, was not often a better place to
live than where many have been living, we would be more successful in
lowering crime rates.  ... Sorry.... I'm on my soap-box!  All I meant to
do was say, THANK YOU!

Dear Governor and staff,
I appreciate the third NEWSLETTER response.  However you have not addressed my specific concerns. I tried e-mailing my concerns about the 30th brigade and their dedication. The fact they all received a letter from the state that they would be getting their re-enlistment bonuses.  Now I have heard from my husband they have been on hold.  Governor Perdue-this is a total dishonor of our well trained soldiers, that like you have worked their lives to serve this great state. However, you have the power as Commander and Chief of the North Carolina Guard to re-instate the $15,000 bonuses for our honored soldiers and their families.  For God sakes, you have new enlisted soldiers getting them.
I want an appointment with the Governor and I want answers.  How can you deny the soldiers and the families that are leaving in April for a 12 month tour IRAQ.
I am entiltied to meet with Governor Perdue as am a soldiers wife and I am a citizen of this great state.
I want to meet with Ms. Perdue, please.  We are the 30th Brigade and you owe us a right to speak.
LeAnne Kittrell

Governor Perdue Proposes Changes to Strengthen Probation Supervision

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced a package of probation and parole initiatives that will improve our criminal justice system and strengthen public safety.  The budget and policy reforms will toughen probation conditions, make absconder information readily available, and improve access to information for law enforcement and probation officers.

â€œThese reforms will hold offenders more accountable, ease officer caseloads and will reduce crime on the streets,â€ said Gov. Perdue.  â€œIt will give probation and law enforcement officers more tools to do their jobs effectively.â€        

â€œProbation officers need to know the history and needs of the offenders they are supervising,â€ said Correction Secretary Alvin Keller.  â€œOpening offenderâ€™s juvenile records to their supervising probation officers will help officers better protect themselves and the public, and help officers secure appropriate treatments and interventions for offenders.â€

Halifax County to Add Manufacturer, 105 Jobs

FASTA Inc., an international producer of steel and foam construction panels, is opening its first manufacturing plant in Littleton.  The company plans to invest $2.5 million and create 105 jobs in Halifax County over the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $300,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

State of the State

On Monday, Gov. Perdue delivered a candid assessment of the challenges North Carolina faces in the midst of the global economic crisis, and what the priorities and tough choices must be to move the state ahead.

Even in this troubled economic environment, Gov. Perdue said, she will focus on job creation and retention, retraining for those who have lost their jobs and investing in the public schools.  Gov. Perdue stressed education and said there will be increased funding for the work that goes on in public school classrooms.

â€œWe must, as the saying goes, â€˜not eat our seed corn,â€™ but continue to move forward on education to keep North Carolina competitive in the global marketplace,â€ Gov. Perdue said.  â€œYes, even in these tough times we will increase per-pupil spending in our public schools.â€

She called on the General Assembly, and all North Carolinians, to help address the stateâ€™s most urgent needs, focus on getting the economy moving again and bring accountability, transparency and efficiency to state government.

What about the illegals in this state ? When can I come home and work again? Should the money i am being taxed for on my unemployment go to provide for the illegals to survive in this economy. I have been unemployed for almost a year and must find a means to pay the taxes on that money I earned. I want my work back.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Thank you for the articles about the current business climate in North Carolina.  In my initial contact e-mail with you, what I was earnest in locating were the current and future commitments and viability to some of the recent programs designed to provide, for ALL STUDENTS, the educational path best designed for them individually, while at the same time providing the business and industry community meaningful and committed access to the educational process of tomorrows talented and motivated labor pool.

During my mid 80's years while working at our district's central office, part of my responsibilities dealt significantly with the "School To Work" and Regional Vocational System's programs emerging in our schools, and I had been researching school programs where I could continue my career path, finding at that time the Govenor of North Carolina had instituted a school funding mantate of infusion of these programs into your state's school systems. (I believe I am recalling that correctly?)    What is the current viability and future direction for industrial arts, industrial-vocational education, "School to Work" (Tech Prep Articulation 2 + 2 + 2 **; Regional Vocational System and Extended Campus) internships, and "Service-Learning" projects & Mentorships in the Lake Norman N. Carolina areas and schools.  In the Northwest Suburban communities of Chicago where I have taught, the shift has been away from the â€œtrueâ€ comprehensive education programs for all students.  My goal is locate a school system that could fully support the precepts of the programs I mentioned above. 


In addition, I am interested in the viable opportunities of these programs to your Native American communities...

Community Based Experiential Education, Prep Articulation 4 + 2 + 2, Extended Campus, School-To-Work, and Service-Learning Programs/Projects, with concentrations and specializations in Native American (and other â€œ4th Worldâ€ Indigenous Peoples/Cultures) inclusion initiatives, designed to re-infuse self-esteem, pride in cultural uniqueness, re-kindle (establish) a â€œrealâ€ sense of self/cultural worth, recognition of their peopleâ€™s contributions and worthy historical context of their civilizationâ€™s contributions throughout history, while establishing an EQUITABLE recognition and place for these peoples uniqueness, by the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd world governments, for the 21st century and beyond.

These are the programs (outlined below)  I assisted in implementing in our high school regional cooperative, and would be interested in knowing what North Carolina's direction is with their future...

 

Through proactive guidance/counseling and placement career orientation and 
planning at the middle school grade levels, selective targeted shadowing 
experiences could be offered to the children in the lower elementary grades, 
and mentoring placements could be planned during the sixth grade for those 
willing to commit to surveying their career interest areas for the studentsâ€™ 
freshman and sophomore grades when entering high school.  Those articulated 
experiences could progress into trade apprenticeships, or the Tech Prep 
Articulation 2 + 2 + 2 or Extended Campus internships during their junior 
and senior high school years, and then continue during the freshman and 
sophomore years of their university or college degree program, terminating 
with a bachelors degree in the students chosen field of study, or entrance 
into a planned program advanced degree.  This school path would be / could 
be adjunct to the college prep degree path currently thought of as the 
primary path for students to follow for their high school graduation.  The 
early benefit of this plan is to provide each student with a saleable skill, 
in which they have an ability, skill and interest.  This ancillary skill 
pathâ€™s benefit is the ability to work at jobs that pay significantly better 
than entry level unskilled labor jobs while they are completing their high 
school and post high school classes.

 

The other aspect of these programs is the offering of and access to the business and industry management and labor force of interested, talented and motivated prospective mentorship and internship participants while they are still in high school.  It offers the opportunity for these professionals to develop positive relationships with these prospective employment pool candidates for their business nitch, and gives them valuable access to groom positive work ethics, values and loyalty; this of course is a two way communication responsibility.



Thank you, Sincerely, Ted...

Dear Governor Perdue:

I recognize that you have just begun your work as governor of North Carolina and that you have some huge budgetary issues facing you.  However, I must register my displeasure with the decision to take money from the education fund in order to balance the budget.  It seems to me that when the lottery was established, citizens of North Carolina were told the money would ONLY be used for education;  that it could not be redirected.  How did that change suddenly?

The second issue on my mind concerns June Atkinson.  Ms. Atkinson was duly elected by voters in North Carolina to serve as Secretary of Education.  Haven't you overstepped your bounds by removing her from her elected office with no reasonable explanation other than to install someone you prefer? 

 I am a registered democrat, support my local, state and US democrats so this is not coming from an "opponent".  Please explain your decisions on these matters so that fellow democrats have an understanding of why we should continue to support your decisions.


Sincerely,


Lynn C. Bennett

Governor Perdue,

I am very positively impressed with the progress you have made so far in addressing the various
needs of NC in the areas of jobs creation, energy conservation, and the safety of citizens.
Since I moved to NC 6 years ago, I have been trying to interest various state agencies and
investors in a patented product that would address all of these concerns. In a nutshell, the product
is a stacking panel system that can be used to create shutters to protect window and door openings.

This system is easily and inexpensively retrofitable on any building without detracting from the
aesthetics of the building. Many other products based on this idea are possible. such as retractable
roof systems, rigid swimming pool covers, and "hardened" portable military structures.

Many jobs would be created by basing the production of these product in North Carolina.

What I need is an entrepreneur, mentor. I am a design engineer and inventor who lacks the skill set
needed to successfully bring this product to market. Please help if you can.

Please take a moment to view a 59 second video clip showing the basic function of an early prototype.
The patent extends through year 2019, US Patent # 6,339,905, inventor Clark Edgar Craig.
1325 Watson Ave. Winston Salem NC 27103 336-725-1331 X279
