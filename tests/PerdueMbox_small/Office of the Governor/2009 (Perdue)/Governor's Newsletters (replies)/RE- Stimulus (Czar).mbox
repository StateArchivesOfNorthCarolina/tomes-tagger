This is not the response I was hoping for but it doesn't surprise me. I get to continue working and those folks who don't can still stay warm stay fed and remain happy because myself and my husband owe them a living and the government will get to bankrupt some other tax payer money same thing they have done with the socialsecurity that I have to pay be will never get back because someone decided they get to sit on their larger than life behind watching oprah.
Thanks for answering my original qiestion way to go!

Dear Governor Perdue,
†† I read the article by Josh Shaffer in the Raleigh News and Observer about the historic marker that is a tribute to John Chavis, "Early 19th Centry Free Negro Preacher and Teacher of Both Races in North Carolina."† It was installed in 1938 on East Street in Southeast Raleigh - the first marker dedicated to black history.
†† The state policy is that it would be sold for scrap metal when it is replaced.† The Central Citizens Advisory Council, formed to start a museum for the East Raleigh-South Park National Historic District, would like to have the sign when it is taken down.† Is there anything you can do to make that happen?
†† John Chavis must have been an extraordinary person; a fighter in the Revolutionary War; a teacher of students, instructing them in Latin and Greek; and a Presbyterian Minister, preaching to black and white - even slaveholders.
What an inspiration this simple sign could be to young people visiting the museum, prompting them†to want to know more about the†person who warranted such a sign.† I was certainly moved to learn more about him when I read the newspaper article..
†† I hope your Office will†do what it can to preserve the sign.
†† Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Martha Phifer

Governor names Dempsey Benton to head the Office of Economic Recovery and Investment

Wednesday, Governor Perdue announced the creation of the Office of Economic Recovery & Investment to coordinate and track North Carolinaís handling of federal stimulus funds as well as state-level economic recovery initiatives.† She named Dempsey Benton, former secretary of the state Health and Human Services Department, to lead the office and provide accountability for use of the recovery dollars.

The federal stimulus package was signed into law this week by President Barack Obama.† It provides about $6.1 billion in direct aid to North Carolina to create jobs and rebuild and expand our stateís critical infrastructure, including highways and schools.† The recovery program will also inject additional money into the state through targeted tax cuts, additional grants from federal agencies and direct funding for specific federal programs in the state.

This temporary office will be assisted by staff in the governorís office and designated representatives from the various state agencies responsible for administering or distributing the federal stimulus funds.


Agreement signed to provide additional money for unemployed

Thursday, Gov. Perdue†signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Labor to provide $25 more per week in federal unemployment insurance benefits to those who qualify under the Unemployed Workers and Struggling Families Act.

February 19th was the earliest the agreement could be executed. The action, part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was passed by Congress and signed by the president, creates a new federally-funded initiative which increases unemployment benefits by $25 a week through calendar year 2009, with a ìphase-outî period for previously-qualified individuals. Gov. Perdue and officials from other states had to sign an agreement to act as the agent for disbursing this money.

ìWe need to do all we can to help people looking for work who have been hard hit by the nationís economic crisis,î said Gov. Perdue. ìI have spoken with Employment Security Commission Chairman Moses Carey, and his staff is already hard at work implementing this initiative as quickly as possible. Within the next few weeks, those unemployed who qualify will begin receiving this money.î


Governor pursues grant money to replace the Yadkin River Bridge

Governor Perdue and NCDOT Secretary Gene Conti will work with Sen. Kay Hagan, Rep. Mel Watt and the rest of North Carolinaís Congressional delegation to obtain funding for the replacement of the Yadkin River Bridge on I-85 in Davidson and Rowan counties.

The federal stimulus and recovery bill signed into law this week by President Obama included $1.5 billion in discretionary grants to be awarded to states for transportation projects.† The estimated cost of the Yadkin River Bridge project is around $300 million.

ìNorth Carolina must preserve the safety and mobility of important transportation links like the Yadkin River Bridge," said Gov. Perdue. "The large price tag, which has made it hard to fund, makes it a perfect candidate for this additional stimulus grant money.î

Cherokee County Manufacturer to Add 40 Jobs

<http://www.snapon.com/>Snap-on Inc., a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools and diagnostic equipment, is expanding its operations in Murphy.† The company plans to invest nearly $2 million and create 40 jobs this year by consolidating operations from a Massachusetts plant to this state.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $120,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

ìNorth Carolinaís manufacturing sector continues to evolve and take advantage of new regional and global opportunities,î Gov. Perdue said. ìSnap-on is one of a growing number of companies that know first-hand our stateís excellent workforce, innovative training and education programs, and top business climate.î

Snap-on Inc., headquartered in Wisconsin, is a household name in professional tools and other equipment, with 35 manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide, including 11 U.S. plants.† The Snap-on plant in Murphy, which makes industrial power tools, employs 178 workers.† The company plans to consolidate its power tools manufacturing operation in Massachusetts to Murphy.

I am deeply disappointed in Governor Perdue's appointment of Dempsey Benton as head of the Office of Economic Recovery.† His track record is abysmal as Secretary of Health and Human Services.† Can we expect that same level of accountability and responsible administration of our tax dollars in his new position?† This is not the kind of change I had hoped for in supporting Governor Perdue.

How can you consider layoffs of state employees when you just hired 2 people at over 100,000 per year. When everyone else is being asked to cut back your hiring positions that could be done by current employees. I also would like to know if you are going to consider mandatory retiements for those with 30 years on.

Governor names Dempsey Benton to head the Office of Economic Recovery and Investment

Wednesday, Governor Perdue announced the creation of the Office of Economic Recovery & Investment to coordinate and track North Carolina‚Äôs handling of federal stimulus funds as well as state-level economic recovery initiatives.† She named Dempsey Benton, former secretary of the state Health and Human Services Department, to lead the office and provide accountability for use of the recovery dollars.

The federal stimulus package was signed into law this week by President Barack Obama.† It provides about $6.1 billion in direct aid to North Carolina to create jobs and rebuild and expand our state‚Äôs critical infrastructure, including highways and schools.† The recovery program will also inject additional money into the state through targeted tax cuts, additional grants from federal agencies and direct funding for specific federal programs in the state.

This temporary office will be assisted by staff in the governor‚Äôs office and designated representatives from the various state agencies responsible for administering or distributing the federal stimulus funds.


Agreement signed to provide additional money for unemployed

Thursday, Gov. Perdue†signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Labor to provide $25 more per week in federal unemployment insurance benefits to those who qualify under the Unemployed Workers and Struggling Families Act.

February 19th was the earliest the agreement could be executed. The action, part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was passed by Congress and signed by the president, creates a new federally-funded initiative which increases unemployment benefits by $25 a week through calendar year 2009, with a ‚Äúphase-out‚Äù period for previously-qualified individuals. Gov. Perdue and officials from other states had to sign an agreement to act as the agent for disbursing this money.

‚ÄúWe need to do all we can to help people looking for work who have been hard hit by the nation‚Äôs economic crisis,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúI have spoken with Employment Security Commission Chairman Moses Carey, and his staff is already hard at work implementing this initiative as quickly as possible. Within the next few weeks, those unemployed who qualify will begin receiving this money.‚Äù


Governor pursues grant money to replace the Yadkin River Bridge

Governor Perdue and NCDOT Secretary Gene Conti will work with Sen. Kay Hagan, Rep. Mel Watt and the rest of North Carolina‚Äôs Congressional delegation to obtain funding for the replacement of the Yadkin River Bridge on I-85 in Davidson and Rowan counties.

The federal stimulus and recovery bill signed into law this week by President Obama included $1.5 billion in discretionary grants to be awarded to states for transportation projects.† The estimated cost of the Yadkin River Bridge project is around $300 million.

‚ÄúNorth Carolina must preserve the safety and mobility of important transportation links like the Yadkin River Bridge," said Gov. Perdue. "The large price tag, which has made it hard to fund, makes it a perfect candidate for this additional stimulus grant money.‚Äù

Cherokee County Manufacturer to Add 40 Jobs

‚ÄúNorth Carolina‚Äôs manufacturing sector continues to evolve and take advantage of new regional and global opportunities,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said. ‚ÄúSnap-on is one of a growing number of companies that know first-hand our state‚Äôs excellent workforce, innovative training and education programs, and top business climate.‚Äù

All of this is fine and dandy, but still†does not force the people who do not deserve our tax dollars to seek employment when they can get a check for sitting back and having more babies to get more food stamps and money. We should be making this a priority, instead of giving them more, take some away and give it back to the people that are paying for this anyway. I am sure that a lot of people could use an extra $ 25.00 or $50.00 in their paycheck to. I have several employees that work very hard for 40 hours or more and still†can not keep their family income paying the bills. Or taking their sick children to see a doctor. But low and behold the ones that get†public assistance can and we have to pay for it. My mother who is†now deceit was unable to get help with food†stamps because they said she was making to much money. She had disability of about $ 740.00 a month. She died from brain cancer but do you think any one cared about her like they do about the drug dealers and the women staying home to have more babies. NOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But instead of giving the people who are working and trying to make it a helping hand you are taking food and shelter away from them. That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard of. Please have Bev Perdue read this!!!!! I would really like to tell her the truth about what is happening out here to people and to small businesses who are struggling to stay afloat.†


Sincerely,

Linda Langley
