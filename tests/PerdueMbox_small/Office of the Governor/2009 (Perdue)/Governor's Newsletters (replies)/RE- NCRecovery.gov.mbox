Governor Launches NCRecovery.gov!

Governor Perdue today launched <http://www.NCRecovery.gov>www.NCRecovery.gov, a guide to services of the newly created Office of Economic Recovery & Investment.† NCRecovery.gov will let visitors track federal recovery funds in North Carolina, as well as learn about local contract and grant opportunities.



"I am committed to providing the people of North Carolina with a simple-to-navigate guide that is efficient, transparent and accountable,î Perdue said. ìI want the people of North Carolina to understand exactly how the money will be used to put North Carolina back to work.î



The website will serve as a resource on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, its impact on North Carolina and information about the state Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.† In the upcoming weeks, visitors will be able to track recovery†money as it is spent, suggest projects for funding and learn how to apply for contracts and grants that may be available.



First Round of Road and Bridge Projects Announced

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue announced the first 70 highway and bridge projects†that†soon will be under way using $466 million in federal economic†recovery funds.†† The†NC Department of Transportation has been working with local planning organizations across the state to determine which projects will be funded by the federal economic recovery dollars.†



The money is the first half that the state will receive for highway improvements through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.† The new federal law requires states to obligate the first half of transportation†recovery money within 120 days of receipt and the remaining half to projects within a year.† The biggest factor in determining†which projects were funded was whether the projects can be under contract by June along with safety, mobility, infrastructure health, and equitable distribution.



The second half of stimulus-related road and bridge projects is expected to be announced in the next 45 days.† According to state transportation officials, this current round of infrastructure investment will create approximately 14,000 jobs for the state.



Governor takes additional steps to manage the budget shortfall

As†part of her ongoing efforts to manage the current budget shortfall, Governor Perdue asked most state agencies for further budget cuts from 7 percent to 9 percent.† At the same time,†the Governor†will continue to protect public education as much as possible while managing the shortfall.



As a precautionary step to manage cash flow, the state will transfer up to $300 million dollars from several special accounts into the General Fund.† The money will be put into a reserve and may be used to support General Fund obligations if necessary. These transfers will be managed so that existing activities supported by these special funds aren't impacted.†



2011 Figure Skating National Championship Coming to Greensboro

Greensboro was selected to host the 2011 U.S. Figure Skating Championships after a lengthy and rigorous selection process.† Approximately 1,500 top skaters from across the country participate in the event. The Championships crown 12 national champions in four disciplines ñ men's singles, women's singles, pairs and ice dancing ñ across three competitive levels: novice, juniors and seniors. The Championships include eight days of competition and are featured on 10 hours of national network broadcast coverage. Recent host cities include Spokane, Washington (2007), St. Paul, Minnesota (2008), and Cleveland, Ohio (2009). The Championships typically generate more than 8,000 hotel room nights and previous hosts have calculated a local economic impact of approximately $30 million.



ìNorth Carolina will be a fantastic location for the 2011 Championships,î said Governor Perdue.† ìWe have a proven track record of successful major events, great facilities and wonderful volunteers. Not only will the Nationals showcase Greensboro and bring valuable dollars to the surrounding area, but the choice of North Carolina as the host state will make for the best possible event.î



Operation Drive to Live 2009

Governor Bev Perdue proclaimed February 23-27 as Teen Safe Driving week and†announced that the N.C. Highway Patrol is kicking off Operation Drive to Live 2009†to reduce teenage traffic fatalities and collisions.



ìThe Highway Patrol is determined to reduce teenage fatal collisions in North Carolina by enforcing all traffic laws around the stateís high schools and conducting traffic safety education programs,î said Perdue.† ìSpeeding and reckless driving are the leading causes of traffic deaths involving teenagers in our state.† Operation Drive to Live 2009 will help in our efforts to reverse that trend.î



During the past four years, 554 teenagers were killed in crashes investigated by the Highway Patrol.† Many collisions involving teenage drivers occur during their commute to and from high school.† Speed is the leading cause of teenage traffic deaths.



During Operation Drive to Live 2009, troopers will be enforcing all traffic laws around the stateís schools and conducting traffic safety education programs at the high schools. Troopers will be looking for violations such as speeding, following too closely, careless and reckless driving, and any violation of the motor vehicle laws that can result in serious injury or death.



Motorists may report dangerous driving to the Highway Patrol by dialing *HP on their cellular phones from anywhere in the state.† For more information about Operation Drive to Live 2009, visit the N.C. Department of Crime Control and Public Safetyís website at <http://www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp>www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp.

Governor Launches NCRecovery.gov!

Governor Perdue today launched <http://www.NCRecovery.gov>www.NCRecovery.gov, a guide to services of the newly created Office of Economic Recovery & Investment.† NCRecovery.gov will let visitors track federal recovery funds in North Carolina, as well as learn about local contract and grant opportunities.



"I am committed to providing the people of North Carolina with a simple-to-navigate guide that is efficient, transparent and accountable,î Perdue said. ìI want the people of North Carolina to understand exactly how the money will be used to put North Carolina back to work.î



The website will serve as a resource on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, its impact on North Carolina and information about the state Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.† In the upcoming weeks, visitors will be able to track recovery†money as it is spent, suggest projects for funding and learn how to apply for contracts and grants that may be available.



First Round of Road and Bridge Projects Announced

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue announced the first 70 highway and bridge projects†that†soon will be under way using $466 million in federal economic†recovery funds.†† The†NC Department of Transportation has been working with local planning organizations across the state to determine which projects will be funded by the federal economic recovery dollars.†



The money is the first half that the state will receive for highway improvements through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.† The new federal law requires states to obligate the first half of transportation†recovery money within 120 days of receipt and the remaining half to projects within a year.† The biggest factor in determining†which projects were funded was whether the projects can be under contract by June along with safety, mobility, infrastructure health, and equitable distribution.



The second half of stimulus-related road and bridge projects is expected to be announced in the next 45 days.† According to state transportation officials, this current round of infrastructure investment will create approximately 14,000 jobs for the state.



Governor takes additional steps to manage the budget shortfall

As†part of her ongoing efforts to manage the current budget shortfall, Governor Perdue asked most state agencies for further budget cuts from 7 percent to 9 percent.† At the same time,†the Governor†will continue to protect public education as much as possible while managing the shortfall.



As a precautionary step to manage cash flow, the state will transfer up to $300 million dollars from several special accounts into the General Fund.† The money will be put into a reserve and may be used to support General Fund obligations if necessary. These transfers will be managed so that existing activities supported by these special funds aren't impacted.†



2011 Figure Skating National Championship Coming to Greensboro

Greensboro was selected to host the 2011 U.S. Figure Skating Championships after a lengthy and rigorous selection process.† Approximately 1,500 top skaters from across the country participate in the event. The Championships crown 12 national champions in four disciplines ñ men's singles, women's singles, pairs and ice dancing ñ across three competitive levels: novice, juniors and seniors. The Championships include eight days of competition and are featured on 10 hours of national network broadcast coverage. Recent host cities include Spokane, Washington (2007), St. Paul, Minnesota (2008), and Cleveland, Ohio (2009). The Championships typically generate more than 8,000 hotel room nights and previous hosts have calculated a local economic impact of approximately $30 million.



ìNorth Carolina will be a fantastic location for the 2011 Championships,î said Governor Perdue.† ìWe have a proven track record of successful major events, great facilities and wonderful volunteers. Not only will the Nationals showcase Greensboro and bring valuable dollars to the surrounding area, but the choice of North Carolina as the host state will make for the best possible event.î



Operation Drive to Live 2009

Governor Bev Perdue proclaimed February 23-27 as Teen Safe Driving week and†announced that the N.C. Highway Patrol is kicking off Operation Drive to Live 2009†to reduce teenage traffic fatalities and collisions.



ìThe Highway Patrol is determined to reduce teenage fatal collisions in North Carolina by enforcing all traffic laws around the stateís high schools and conducting traffic safety education programs,î said Perdue.† ìSpeeding and reckless driving are the leading causes of traffic deaths involving teenagers in our state.† Operation Drive to Live 2009 will help in our efforts to reverse that trend.î



During the past four years, 554 teenagers were killed in crashes investigated by the Highway Patrol.† Many collisions involving teenage drivers occur during their commute to and from high school.† Speed is the leading cause of teenage traffic deaths.



During Operation Drive to Live 2009, troopers will be enforcing all traffic laws around the stateís schools and conducting traffic safety education programs at the high schools. Troopers will be looking for violations such as speeding, following too closely, careless and reckless driving, and any violation of the motor vehicle laws that can result in serious injury or death.



Motorists may report dangerous driving to the Highway Patrol by dialing *HP on their cellular phones from anywhere in the state.† For more information about Operation Drive to Live 2009, visit the N.C.

Governor Launches NCRecovery.gov!

Governor Perdue today launched <http://www.NCRecovery.gov>www.NCRecovery.gov, a guide to services of the newly created Office of Economic Recovery & Investment.† NCRecovery.gov will let visitors track federal recovery funds in North Carolina, as well as learn about local contract and grant opportunities.

"I am committed to providing the people of North Carolina with a simple-to-navigate guide that is efficient, transparent and accountable,î Perdue said. ìI want the people of North Carolina to understand exactly how the money will be used to put North Carolina back to work.î

The website will serve as a resource on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, its impact on North Carolina and information about the state Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.† In the upcoming weeks, visitors will be able to track recovery†money as it is spent, suggest projects for funding and learn how to apply for contracts and grants that may be available.


First Round of Road and Bridge Projects Announced

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue announced the first 70 highway and bridge projects†that†soon will be under way using $466 million in federal economic†recovery funds.†† The†NC Department of Transportation has been working with local planning organizations across the state to determine which projects will be funded by the federal economic recovery dollars.†

The money is the first half that the state will receive for highway improvements through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.† The new federal law requires states to obligate the first half of transportation†recovery money within 120 days of receipt and the remaining half to projects within a year.† The biggest factor in determining†which projects were funded was whether the projects can be under contract by June along with safety, mobility, infrastructure health, and equitable distribution.

The second half of stimulus-related road and bridge projects is expected to be announced in the next 45 days.† According to state transportation officials, this current round of infrastructure investment will create approximately 14,000 jobs for the state.


Governor takes additional steps to manage the budget shortfall

As†part of her ongoing efforts to manage the current budget shortfall, Governor Perdue asked most state agencies for further budget cuts from 7 percent to 9 percent.† At the same time,†the Governor†will continue to protect public education as much as possible while managing the shortfall.

As a precautionary step to manage cash flow, the state will transfer up to $300 million dollars from several special accounts into the General Fund.† The money will be put into a reserve and may be used to support General Fund obligations if necessary. These transfers will be managed so that existing activities supported by these special funds aren't impacted.†


2011 Figure Skating National Championship Coming to Greensboro

Greensboro was selected to host the 2011 U.S. Figure Skating Championships after a lengthy and rigorous selection process.† Approximately 1,500 top skaters from across the country participate in the event. The Championships crown 12 national champions in four disciplines ñ men's singles, women's singles, pairs and ice dancing ñ across three competitive levels: novice, juniors and seniors. The Championships include eight days of competition and are featured on 10 hours of national network broadcast coverage. Recent host cities include Spokane, Washington (2007), St. Paul, Minnesota (2008), and Cleveland, Ohio (2009). The Championships typically generate more than 8,000 hotel room nights and previous hosts have calculated a local economic impact of approximately $30 million.

ìNorth Carolina will be a fantastic location for the 2011 Championships,î said Governor Perdue.† ìWe have a proven track record of successful major events, great facilities and wonderful volunteers. Not only will the Nationals showcase Greensboro and bring valuable dollars to the surrounding area, but the choice of North Carolina as the host state will make for the best possible event.î


Operation Drive to Live 2009

Governor Bev Perdue proclaimed February 23-27 as Teen Safe Driving week and†announced that the N.C. Highway Patrol is kicking off Operation Drive to Live 2009†to reduce teenage traffic fatalities and collisions.

ìThe Highway Patrol is determined to reduce teenage fatal collisions in North Carolina by enforcing all traffic laws around the stateís high schools and conducting traffic safety education programs,î said Perdue.† ìSpeeding and reckless driving are the leading causes of traffic deaths involving teenagers in our state.† Operation Drive to Live 2009 will help in our efforts to reverse that trend.î

During the past four years, 554 teenagers were killed in crashes investigated by the Highway Patrol.† Many collisions involving teenage drivers occur during their commute to and from high school.† Speed is the leading cause of teenage traffic deaths.

During Operation Drive to Live 2009, troopers will be enforcing all traffic laws around the stateís schools and conducting traffic safety education programs at the high schools. Troopers will be looking for violations such as speeding, following too closely, careless and reckless driving, and any violation of the motor vehicle laws that can result in serious injury or death.

Motorists may report dangerous driving to the Highway Patrol by dialing *HP on their cellular phones from anywhere in the state.† For more information about Operation Drive to Live 2009, visit the N.C. Department of Crime Control and Public Safetyís website at <http://www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp>www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp.

Governor Perdue and Staff-
As much as I do appreciate your responding and giving me an option to sign up for your newsletter you all did not hit the mark on my subject and expalin why we are not†honoring our soldiers with the re-enlistment bonuses in which†they had been sent a letter stating they would get. They deserve these bonuses!† So we going to build a skating school in Greenville.
Again Ms. Perdue, you are the Commader and Cheif of the State of North Carolina
30th brigade Heavy Combat Unit one of the largest in the United States.† They are a whole unit that delpoys as a whole brigade,†and you are saying to us that you have decided that other things are on†your agenda.† These men and women leave their familes.† They have also been there everyday†to take care of whatever the state decides they should do.
What you are telling us is that they do not deserve those re-enlisted bonuses, is that correct?†† Those years of service they beleived in for the state of North Carolina and attaching to Army and leaving their families.††You honestly can say it is OK that these soldiers do not qualify or meet your personal agenda?
Hey crew for MS. Perdue-I want a statement from her personally-about how she has decided that our soldiers bonuses are not valid now.
We got a letter saying he does qualify and other soldiers did as well.† We are as a whole† are looking for an answer from our Commader as to why this is not happening regardless of rank.
I await your response-

LeAnne Kittrell

I sent you an email about grandparents who are taking care of grandkids and can't get no help what is our government doing about that. my husband and myself have worked all our lives to build a good life we raised our children the best we can now it is our time to live, but because we did this we are penalized when we make good money and have to use it to raise our grandkids, we have paid our taxes and now in our older years with illness coming on us and doctors bills and the rising cost of medicine that we saved for because of this we can't get any help from the gov. ie..food stamps or medical for†myself and my husband because we own a home and cars, that we worked for we have to sell everything just to get help, I didn't ask to have to raise my-step grandkids but it happened, could have put them in foster care with possible someone who is mean or a predator, couldn't do that. then the state would have to foot the whole bill. they need to get tougher on child support and I don't mean just take their driver license away because that don't work they still drive, big deal. they need to make it harder for them†to do anything, like when they†get a job the employer should have to check for wanted child support and have to notify the†police or courts so they can†collect it, if they are hired or something like that.†just get a whole lot tougher and let grandparents†who have legal custody through court collect at least food stamps to help with†some of the cost.†this state needs a lot more than just jobs,†the†education system stinks bad. the bus drivers would not have a job in the north when they don't show up for work the kids wouldn't be standing out side until 9 and†10 to be†picked up for school no wonder they don't learn anything they don't†get enough time in school the†teacher work day are a waste of time if they can't do their job while they are in†school they don't need to be teachers, well went off track.†am I angry yes I am. does the system suck, yes it does. do our politicians care HELL NO. put everybody back to work and the hell with the stimulus package. the system surely doesn't care about the older people who are the ones who worked to the economy where it used to be, now we have to suffer because the younger people won't work or take care of there kids. well said enough. Thank you, for what I don't know.

Governor Perdue,

You should not have accepted this money.† That is taking money from our children, not only the upcoming generation, but ones not even born yet.† This is immoral.†

On top of that, these jobs are artificial in some sense.† Inflating government programs is historically proven to be foolish.† More government always leads to a lower standard of living for everyone in general.

Please consider doing the right thing.

Subject: [Office of Governor Bev Perdue] Governor Launches NCRecovery.gov



	<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/library/images/newsletterHeader.jpg>


Governor Launches NCRecovery.gov!

Governor Perdue today launched <http://www.ncrecovery.gov/>www.NCRecovery.gov, a guide to services of the newly created Office of Economic Recovery & Investment.† NCRecovery.gov will let visitors track federal recovery funds in North Carolina, as well as learn about local contract and grant opportunities.

"I am committed to providing the people of North Carolina with a simple-to-navigate guide that is efficient, transparent and accountable,î Perdue said. ìI want the people of North Carolina to understand exactly how the money will be used to put North Carolina back to work.î

The website will serve as a resource on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, its impact on North Carolina and information about the state Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.† In the upcoming weeks, visitors will be able to track recovery†money as it is spent, suggest projects for funding and learn how to apply for contracts and grants that may be available.


First Round of Road and Bridge Projects Announced

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue announced the first 70 highway and bridge projects†that†soon will be under way using $466 million in federal economic†recovery funds.†† The†NC Department of Transportation has been working with local planning organizations across the state to determine which projects will be funded by the federal economic recovery dollars.†

The money is the first half that the state will receive for highway improvements through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.† The new federal law requires states to obligate the first half of transportation†recovery money within 120 days of receipt and the remaining half to projects within a year.† The biggest factor in determining†which projects were funded was whether the projects can be under contract by June along with safety, mobility, infrastructure health, and equitable distribution.

The second half of stimulus-related road and bridge projects is expected to be announced in the next 45 days.† According to state transportation officials, this current round of infrastructure investment will create approximately 14,000 jobs for the state.


Governor takes additional steps to manage the budget shortfall

As†part of her ongoing efforts to manage the current budget shortfall, Governor Perdue asked most state agencies for further budget cuts from 7 percent to 9 percent.† At the same time,†the Governor†will continue to protect public education as much as possible while managing the shortfall.

As a precautionary step to manage cash flow, the state will transfer up to $300 million dollars from several special accounts into the General Fund.† The money will be put into a reserve and may be used to support General Fund obligations if necessary. These transfers will be managed so that existing activities supported by these special funds aren't impacted.†


2011 Figure Skating National Championship Coming to Greensboro

Greensboro was selected to host the 2011 U.S. Figure Skating Championships after a lengthy and rigorous selection process.† Approximately 1,500 top skaters from across the country participate in the event. The Championships crown 12 national champions in four disciplines ñ men's singles, women's singles, pairs and ice dancing ñ across three competitive levels: novice, juniors and seniors. The Championships include eight days of competition and are featured on 10 hours of national network broadcast coverage. Recent host cities include Spokane, Washington (2007), St. Paul, Minnesota (2008), and Cleveland, Ohio (2009). The Championships typically generate more than 8,000 hotel room nights and previous hosts have calculated a local economic impact of approximately $30 million.

ìNorth Carolina will be a fantastic location for the 2011 Championships,î said Governor Perdue.† ìWe have a proven track record of successful major events, great facilities and wonderful volunteers. Not only will the Nationals showcase Greensboro and bring valuable dollars to the surrounding area, but the choice of North Carolina as the host state will make for the best possible event.î


Operation Drive to Live 2009

Governor Bev Perdue proclaimed February 23-27 as Teen Safe Driving week and†announced that the N.C. Highway Patrol is kicking off Operation Drive to Live 2009†to reduce teenage traffic fatalities and collisions.

ìThe Highway Patrol is determined to reduce teenage fatal collisions in North Carolina by enforcing all traffic laws around the stateís high schools and conducting traffic safety education programs,î said Perdue.† ìSpeeding and reckless driving are the leading causes of traffic deaths involving teenagers in our state.† Operation Drive to Live 2009 will help in our efforts to reverse that trend.î

During the past four years, 554 teenagers were killed in crashes investigated by the Highway Patrol.† Many collisions involving teenage drivers occur during their commute to and from high school.† Speed is the leading cause of teenage traffic deaths.

During Operation Drive to Live 2009, troopers will be enforcing all traffic laws around the stateís schools and conducting traffic safety education programs at the high schools. Troopers will be looking for violations such as speeding, following too closely, careless and reckless driving, and any violation of the motor vehicle laws that can result in serious injury or death.

Motorists may report dangerous driving to the Highway Patrol by dialing *HP on their cellular phones from anywhere in the state.† For more information about Operation Drive to Live 2009, visit the N.C. Department of Crime Control and Public Safetyís website at <http://www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp>www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp.

Governor Perdue,

Do you think it really necessary to spend so much money on roads and bridges?† I know our roads are a lot worse than they used to be, having potholes and patches in them, but I cannot think of any bridges which need repair here in Western North Carolina (Asheville).† I know about the new lanes to be added to I-40, which will impact the neighborhood in which I live immensely, taking two houses which are not very far from my home.† This will mean more emissions as well as noise from vehicles for my family.† I attended the meeting here in Asheville and placed my concerns about it there to no avail.† Will†this create new jobs or just keep jobs†for the people of the Department of Transportation who are already employed by the State?† In my opinion, which may not count for much,†although I did vote for you, this money could be put to better use in this tight economy.

Thank you for your†consideration.

Sincerely,

Margaret Whiteside

I appreciate the receipt of this and for all the efforts of the Governor's office.
I am still 'blowing in the wind', as I do not seem to "qualify" for anything, as yet.
I have sought counselling from Consumer Credit Counselling, but they are WEEKS, if not a month for availability for appointment.
I†am being put out of business by this economic downturn.† For the last 3 years, I have been rehabing and renovating houses for the rental market, but must sell now (if they will sell).† I have owned rental houses for 12 years.
1) banks stopped lending
2) property taxes on my houses (in Durham and Raleigh) doubled and tripled
3) tenants moved out, as they lost their jobs.
4) rental amounts decreased.
How can I not qualify for anything?† What good will more foreclosures or houses for sale on the market do?
I was viable, I was in good shape, now, all my cash is gone.† I cannot pay mortgages, not even on my own home.
I just heard the City of Raleigh is requiring a registration in the amount of $500 annually.† Is the city of Raleigh trying to drive me and others like me out of the business????????????
Please direct me to counselling now or sources of help.
Many Thanks

> Governor Launches NCRecovery.gov!

Governor Perdue today launched <http://www.ncrecovery.gov/>www.NCRecovery.gov, a guide to services of the newly created Office of Economic Recovery & Investment.† NCRecovery.gov will let visitors track federal recovery funds in North Carolina, as well as learn about local contract and grant opportunities.
"I am committed to providing the people of North Carolina with a simple-to-navigate guide that is efficient, transparent and accountable,î Perdue said. ìI want the people of North Carolina to understand exactly how the money will be used to put North Carolina back to work.î
The website will serve as a resource on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, its impact on North Carolina and information about the state Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.† In the upcoming weeks, visitors will be able to track recovery†money as it is spent, suggest projects for funding and learn how to apply for contracts and grants that may be available.

First Round of Road and Bridge Projects Announced

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue announced the first 70 highway and bridge projects†that†soon will be under way using $466 million in federal economic†recovery funds.†† The†NC Department of Transportation has been working with local planning organizations across the state to determine which projects will be funded by the federal economic recovery dollars.
The money is the first half that the state will receive for highway improvements through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.† The new federal law requires states to obligate the first half of transportation†recovery money within 120 days of receipt and the remaining half to projects within a year.† The biggest factor in determining†which projects were funded was whether the projects can be under contract by June along with safety, mobility, infrastructure health, and equitable distribution.
The second half of stimulus-related road and bridge projects is expected to be announced in the next 45 days. According to state transportation officials, this current round of infrastructure investment will create approximately 14,000 jobs for the state.

Governor takes additional steps to manage the budget shortfall

As†part of her ongoing efforts to manage the current budget shortfall, Governor Perdue asked most state agencies for further budget cuts from 7 percent to 9 percent.† At the same time,†the Governor†will continue to protect public education as much as possible while managing the shortfall.
As a precautionary step to manage cash flow, the state will transfer up to $300 million dollars from several special accounts into the General Fund.† The money will be put into a reserve and may be used to support General Fund obligations if necessary. These transfers will be managed so that existing activities supported by these special funds aren't impacted.†

2011 Figure Skating National Championship Coming to Greensboro

Greensboro was selected to host the 2011 U.S. Figure Skating Championships after a lengthy and rigorous selection process.† Approximately 1,500 top skaters from across the country participate in the event. The Championships crown 12 national champions in four disciplines ñ men's singles, women's singles, pairs and ice dancing ñ across three competitive levels: novice, juniors and seniors. The Championships include eight days of competition and are featured on 10 hours of national network broadcast coverage. Recent host cities include Spokane, Washington (2007), St. Paul, Minnesota (2008), and Cleveland, Ohio (2009). The Championships typically generate more than 8,000 hotel room nights and previous hosts have calculated a local economic impact of approximately $30 million.
ìNorth Carolina will be a fantastic location for the 2011 Championships,î said Governor Perdue.† ìWe have a proven track record of successful major events, great facilities and wonderful volunteers. Not only will the Nationals showcase Greensboro and bring valuable dollars to the surrounding area, but the choice of North Carolina as the host state will make for the best possible event.î

Operation Drive to Live 2009

Governor Bev Perdue proclaimed February 23-27 as Teen Safe Driving week and†announced that the N.C. Highway Patrol is kicking off Operation Drive to Live 2009†to reduce teenage traffic fatalities and collisions.
ìThe Highway Patrol is determined to reduce teenage fatal collisions in North Carolina by enforcing all traffic laws around the stateís high schools and conducting traffic safety education programs,î said Perdue.† ìSpeeding and reckless driving are the leading causes of traffic deaths involving teenagers in our state.† Operation Drive to Live 2009 will help in our efforts to reverse that trend.î
During the past four years, 554 teenagers were killed in crashes investigated by the Highway Patrol.† Many collisions involving teenage drivers occur during their commute to and from high school.† Speed is the leading cause of teenage traffic deaths.
During Operation Drive to Live 2009, troopers will be enforcing all traffic laws around the stateís schools and conducting traffic safety education programs at the high schools. Troopers will be looking for violations such as speeding, following too closely, careless and reckless driving, and any violation of the motor vehicle laws that can result in serious injury or death.
Motorists may report dangerous driving to the Highway Patrol by dialing *HP on their cellular phones from anywhere in the state.† For more information about Operation Drive to Live 2009, visit the N.C. Department of Crime Control and Public Safetyís website at <http://www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp>www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp.

Governor Launches NCRecovery.gov!

Governor Perdue today launched <http://www.ncrecovery.gov/>www.NCRecovery.gov, a guide to services of the newly created Office of Economic Recovery & Investment.† NCRecovery.gov will let visitors track federal recovery funds in North Carolina, as well as learn about local contract and grant opportunities.

"I am committed to providing the people of North Carolina with a simple-to-navigate guide that is efficient, transparent and accountable,‚Äù Perdue said. ‚ÄúI want the people of North Carolina to understand exactly how the money will be used to put North Carolina back to work.‚Äù

The website will serve as a resource on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, its impact on North Carolina and information about the state Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.† In the upcoming weeks, visitors will be able to track recovery†money as it is spent, suggest projects for funding and learn how to apply for contracts and grants that may be available.


First Round of Road and Bridge Projects Announced

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue announced the first 70 highway and bridge projects†that†soon will be under way using $466 million in federal economic†recovery funds.†† The†NC Department of Transportation has been working with local planning organizations across the state to determine which projects will be funded by the federal economic recovery dollars.†

The money is the first half that the state will receive for highway improvements through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.† The new federal law requires states to obligate the first half of transportation†recovery money within 120 days of receipt and the remaining half to projects within a year.† The biggest factor in determining†which projects were funded was whether the projects can be under contract by June along with safety, mobility, infrastructure health, and equitable distribution.

The second half of stimulus-related road and bridge projects is expected to be announced in the next 45 days.† According to state transportation officials, this current round of infrastructure investment will create approximately 14,000 jobs for the state.


Governor takes additional steps to manage the budget shortfall

As†part of her ongoing efforts to manage the current budget shortfall, Governor Perdue asked most state agencies for further budget cuts from 7 percent to 9 percent.† At the same time,†the Governor†will continue to protect public education as much as possible while managing the shortfall.

As a precautionary step to manage cash flow, the state will transfer up to $300 million dollars from several special accounts into the General Fund.† The money will be put into a reserve and may be used to support General Fund obligations if necessary. These transfers will be managed so that existing activities supported by these special funds aren't impacted.†


2011 Figure Skating National Championship Coming to Greensboro

Greensboro was selected to host the 2011 U.S. Figure Skating Championships after a lengthy and rigorous selection process.† Approximately 1,500 top skaters from across the country participate in the event. The Championships crown 12 national champions in four disciplines ‚Äì men's singles, women's singles, pairs and ice dancing ‚Äì across three competitive levels: novice, juniors and seniors. The Championships include eight days of competition and are featured on 10 hours of national network broadcast coverage. Recent host cities include Spokane, Washington (2007), St. Paul, Minnesota (2008), and Cleveland, Ohio (2009). The Championships typically generate more than 8,000 hotel room nights and previous hosts have calculated a local economic impact of approximately $30 million.

‚ÄúNorth Carolina will be a fantastic location for the 2011 Championships,‚Äù said Governor Perdue.† ‚ÄúWe have a proven track record of successful major events, great facilities and wonderful volunteers. Not only will the Nationals showcase Greensboro and bring valuable dollars to the surrounding area, but the choice of North Carolina as the host state will make for the best possible event.‚Äù

You raised my taxes on cigarettes to pay for medical insurance for someone else's kids, I don't even have insurance.
I will be forced to NOT support a local business.
I am not a construction worker, nor an Ice skater, nor a State trooper.
I'm not even Mexican.
Everyone in Government makes more than I, there for doesn't represent me.
I do not approve of Federal or State Government†pissing away†my, my Grandkids, and my Grandkids†kids tax dollars.
Americans must make sacrifices while Government†grants themselves†self appointed raises.
As with Government, Illegals run amuck.
Personally, I await the Tea Party.
Chaos is Coming.

AND I SURELY DID NOT SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR GOVERNMENT†OPERATED SIMULATED EXPLANATIONS OF WHERE THE MONEY†GOES SITE!
REMOVE MY EMAIL ADDY!

AS WITH THE LIP MOVEMENT†OF†ELEPHANT AND DONKEY†POLITICIANS, IM SURE†YOUR SITE†TELLS A NICE BEDTIME STORY FOR FUTURES TO COME.
LEGAL AMERICANS KNOW BETTER.

God help us.

Operation Drive to Live 2009

Governor Bev Perdue proclaimed February 23-27 as Teen Safe Driving week and†announced that the N.C. Highway Patrol is kicking off Operation Drive to Live 2009†to reduce teenage traffic fatalities and collisions.

ìThe Highway Patrol is determined to reduce teenage fatal collisions in North Carolina by enforcing all traffic laws around the stateís high schools and conducting traffic safety education programs,î said Perdue.† ìSpeeding and reckless driving are the leading causes of traffic deaths involving teenagers in our state.† Operation Drive to Live 2009 will help in our efforts to reverse that trend.î

During the past four years, 554 teenagers were killed in crashes investigated by the Highway Patrol.† Many collisions involving teenage drivers occur during their commute to and from high school.† Speed is the leading cause of teenage traffic deaths.

During Operation Drive to Live 2009, troopers will be enforcing all traffic laws around the stateís schools and conducting traffic safety education programs at the high schools. Troopers will be looking for violations such as speeding, following too closely, careless and reckless driving, and any violation of the motor vehicle laws that can result in serious injury or death.

Motorists may report dangerous driving to the Highway Patrol by dialing *HP on their cellular phones from anywhere in the state.† For more information about Operation Drive to Live 2009, visit the N.C.

Governor Launches NCRecovery.gov!

Governor Perdue today launched www.NCRecovery.gov, a guide to services

NCRecovery.gov will let visitors track federal recovery funds in North

"I am committed to providing the people of North Carolina with a

Reinvestment Act, its impact on North Carolina and information about
the state Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.  In the upcoming
weeks, visitors will be able to track recovery money as it is spent,
suggest projects for funding and learn how to apply for contracts and

The money is the first half that the state will receive for highway

new federal law requires states to obligate the first half of

determining which projects were funded was whether the projects can be
under contract by June along with safety, mobility, infrastructure

The second half of stimulus-related road and bridge projects is

transportation officials, this current round of infrastructure
investment will create approximately 14,000 jobs for the state.





Governor takes additional steps to manage the budget shortfall

Governor Perdue asked most state agencies for further budget cuts from

As a precautionary step to manage cash flow, the state will transfer up
to $300 million dollars from several special accounts into the General
Fund.  The money will be put into a reserve and may be used to support
General Fund obligations if necessary. These transfers will be managed
so that existing activities supported by these special funds aren't
impacted.







2011 Figure Skating National Championship Coming to Greensboro

Greensboro was selected to host the 2011 U.S. Figure Skating
Championships after a lengthy and rigorous selection process.
Approximately 1,500 top skaters from across the country participate in
the event. The Championships crown 12 national champions in four
disciplines ‚Äì men's singles, women's singles, pairs and ice dancing ‚Äì
across three competitive levels: novice, juniors and seniors. The
Championships include eight days of competition and are featured on 10
hours of national network broadcast coverage. Recent host cities
include Spokane, Washington (2007), St. Paul, Minnesota (2008), and
Cleveland, Ohio (2009). The Championships typically generate more than
8,000 hotel room nights and previous hosts have calculated a local
economic impact of approximately $30 million.



‚ÄúNorth Carolina will be a fantastic location for
the 2011
Championships,‚Äù said Governor Perdue.  ‚ÄúWe have a proven track record
of successful major events, great facilities and wonderful volunteers.
Not only will the Nationals showcase Greensboro and bring valuable
dollars to the surrounding area, but the choice of North Carolina as
the host state will make for the best possible event.‚Äù




Operation Drive to Live 2009

Governor Bev Perdue proclaimed February 23-27 as Teen Safe Driving week
and announced that the N.C. Highway Patrol is kicking off Operation
Drive to Live 2009 to reduce teenage traffic fatalities and collisions.



‚ÄúThe Highway Patrol is determined to reduce teenage fatal collisions in
North Carolina by enforcing all traffic laws around the state‚Äôs high
schools and conducting traffic safety education programs,‚Äù said
Perdue.  ‚ÄúSpeeding and reckless driving are the leading causes of
traffic deaths involving teenagers in our state.  Operation Drive to
Live 2009 will help in our efforts to reverse that trend.‚Äù



During the past four years, 554 teenagers were killed in crashes
investigated by the Highway Patrol.  Many collisions involving teenage
drivers occur during their commute to and from high school.  Speed is
the leading cause of teenage traffic deaths.



During Operation Drive to Live 2009, troopers will be enforcing all
traffic laws around the
 state‚Äôs schools and conducting traffic safety
education programs at the high schools. Troopers will be looking for
violations such as speeding, following too closely, careless and
reckless driving, and any violation of the motor vehicle laws that can
result in serious injury or death.



Motorists may report dangerous driving to the Highway Patrol by dialing
*HP on their cellular phones from anywhere in the state.  For more
information about Operation Drive to Live 2009, visit the N.C.

Gov. Perdue,† I was saddened to learn that our State Health Plan for Retirees is going up on the cost of our benefits, all the while, Pres. Obama is telling us health care is going to be provided†for those that don't have it.† A prescription I have to depend on (and there is not a generic†out there like it) is now costing me $50.00 a month; when††prior† to the current situation I only had to pay $30.00 a month.† Oh, I could get several different prescriptions that would cover all that the one prescription took care for me, it would not be as healthy, and it would end up costing me even more.† I had to go on disability so I'm suppose to live on my monthly check in the amount of $1,097.53. Please help us out.

Thank you,

Governor Launches NCRecovery.gov!

Governor Perdue today launched <http://www.NCRecovery.gov>www.NCRecovery.gov, a guide to services of the newly created Office of Economic Recovery & Investment.† NCRecovery.gov will let visitors track federal recovery funds in North Carolina, as well as learn about local contract and grant opportunities.

"I am committed to providing the people of North Carolina with a simple-to-navigate guide that is efficient, transparent and accountable,î Perdue said. ìI want the people of North Carolina to understand exactly how the money will be used to put North Carolina back to work.î

The website will serve as a resource on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, its impact on North Carolina and information about the state Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.† In the upcoming weeks, visitors will be able to track recovery†money as it is spent, suggest projects for funding and learn how to apply for contracts and grants that may be available.


First Round of Road and Bridge Projects Announced

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue announced the first 70 highway and bridge projects†that†soon will be under way using $466 million in federal economic†recovery funds.†† The†NC Department of Transportation has been working with local planning organizations across the state to determine which projects will be funded by the federal economic recovery dollars.†

The money is the first half that the state will receive for highway improvements through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.† The new federal law requires states to obligate the first half of transportation†recovery money within 120 days of receipt and the remaining half to projects within a year.† The biggest factor in determining†which projects were funded was whether the projects can be under contract by June along with safety, mobility, infrastructure health, and equitable distribution.

The second half of stimulus-related road and bridge projects is expected to be announced in the next 45 days.† According to state transportation officials, this current round of infrastructure investment will create approximately 14,000 jobs for the state.


Governor takes additional steps to manage the budget shortfall

As†part of her ongoing efforts to manage the current budget shortfall, Governor Perdue asked most state agencies for further budget cuts from 7 percent to 9 percent.† At the same time,†the Governor†will continue to protect public education as much as possible while managing the shortfall.

As a precautionary step to manage cash flow, the state will transfer up to $300 million dollars from several special accounts into the General Fund.† The money will be put into a reserve and may be used to support General Fund obligations if necessary. These transfers will be managed so that existing activities supported by these special funds aren't impacted.†

Governor Perdue, in your new recovery plan that tracts the money into your state, has the infestation of illegal foreigners in our Nation had an adverse impact on your states economy ?
Have they had a impact on your Medical, Educational, Welfare and all other public assistance programs ?
Here are some questions you might ask;
(1) What % of criminal arrest are illegals ?
(2) What % of Welfare recipients through fraudulent means are illegals ?
(3) What % of drunk driving arrest are illegals ?
(4) What % of W.I.C., Food Stamps, and free school lunches are illegals ?
(5) What % of gang members are illegals ?
(6) What is the annual cost to incarcerate illegals in your state ?
(7) What % of fraudulent unemployment checks are going to illegals ?
(8) What % of HUD residents are illegals ?
(9) What is the cost to your American citizens to support these programs for illegal foreigners in your state ?
(10) How can you, as an elected official, stop incentives in your state for illegal foreigners in your state ?

These illegal foreigners are well schooled on how to use fraudulent means and documentation to gain access to various public programs. Thanks to groupe like LA RAZA, LULAC, †AND MECha.

You are in a great position to help your citizens to fight this invasion of foreigners in our Nation illegally.
By taking away incentives, jobs and sanctuary policies, they will be forced to return to their nation of origin and if they really want to become Americans, they can go through the correct process.I believe we have already learned that †granting amnesty to foreigners in our Nation illegally , is NOT the answer .

Thank you for your time.

A Good Credit Score is 700 or Above. <http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100126575x1218822736x1201267884/aol?redir=http:%2F%2Fwww.freecreditreport.com%2Fpm%2Fdefault.aspx%3Fsc%3D668072%26hmpgID%3D62%26bcd%3DfebemailfooterNO62> See yours in just 2 easy steps!

I applaud you for setting up the webb site, Please include how many†"new" employees will benefit from these positions. Will you be going to the "unemployment" office to fill these new positions or will†it be the employees we have now? My understanding is that you will be hiring more employees that are laid off and put them back to work with this money.
Hopefully you will be using North Carolina companies to full fill this†work. Out of state companies should not be doing this work. Please include in this transpancy site, how many people you have hired from unemployment to fore fill these positions. So we can see our tax dollars working.
Please answer this , not with an automatic answer that I have been receiving.††
Thank you so much for your time.

Governor Launches NCRecovery.gov!

Governor Perdue today launched <http://www.ncrecovery.gov/>www.NCRecovery.gov, a guide to services of the newly created Office of Economic Recovery & Investment.† NCRecovery.gov will let visitors track federal recovery funds in North Carolina, as well as learn about local contract and grant opportunities.

"I am committed to providing the people of North Carolina with a simple-to-navigate guide that is efficient, transparent and accountable,î Perdue said. ìI want the people of North Carolina to understand exactly how the money will be used to put North Carolina back to work.î

The website will serve as a resource on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, its impact on North Carolina and information about the state Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.† In the upcoming weeks, visitors will be able to track recovery†money as it is spent, suggest projects for funding and learn how to apply for contracts and grants that may be available.


First Round of Road and Bridge Projects Announced

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue announced the first 70 highway and bridge projects†that†soon will be under way using $466 million in federal economic†recovery funds.†† The†NC Department of Transportation has been working with local planning organizations across the state to determine which projects will be funded by the federal economic recovery dollars.†

The money is the first half that the state will receive for highway improvements through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.† The new federal law requires states to obligate the first half of transportation†recovery money within 120 days of receipt and the remaining half to projects within a year.† The biggest factor in determining†which projects were funded was whether the projects can be under contract by June along with safety, mobility, infrastructure health, and equitable distribution.

The second half of stimulus-related road and bridge projects is expected to be announced in the next 45 days.† According to state transportation officials, this current round of infrastructure investment will create approximately 14,000 jobs for the state.


Governor takes additional steps to manage the budget shortfall

As†part of her ongoing efforts to manage the current budget shortfall, Governor Perdue asked most state agencies for further budget cuts from 7 percent to 9 percent.† At the same time,†the Governor†will continue to protect public education as much as possible while managing the shortfall.

As a precautionary step to manage cash flow, the state will transfer up to $300 million dollars from several special accounts into the General Fund.† The money will be put into a reserve and may be used to support General Fund obligations if necessary. These transfers will be managed so that existing activities supported by these special funds aren't impacted.†


2011 Figure Skating National Championship Coming to Greensboro

Greensboro was selected to host the 2011 U.S. Figure Skating Championships after a lengthy and rigorous selection process.† Approximately 1,500 top skaters from across the country participate in the event. The Championships crown 12 national champions in four disciplines ñ men's singles, women's singles, pairs and ice dancing ñ across three competitive levels: novice, juniors and seniors. The Championships include eight days of competition and are featured on 10 hours of national network broadcast coverage. Recent host cities include Spokane, Washington (2007), St. Paul, Minnesota (2008), and Cleveland, Ohio (2009). The Championships typically generate more than 8,000 hotel room nights and previous hosts have calculated a local economic impact of approximately $30 million.

ìNorth Carolina will be a fantastic location for the 2011 Championships,î said Governor Perdue.† ìWe have a proven track record of successful major events, great facilities and wonderful volunteers. Not only will the Nationals showcase Greensboro and bring valuable dollars to the surrounding area, but the choice of North Carolina as the host state will make for the best possible event.î


Operation Drive to Live 2009

Governor Bev Perdue proclaimed February 23-27 as Teen Safe Driving week and†announced that the N.C. Highway Patrol is kicking off Operation Drive to Live 2009†to reduce teenage traffic fatalities and collisions.

ìThe Highway Patrol is determined to reduce teenage fatal collisions in North Carolina by enforcing all traffic laws around the stateís high schools and conducting traffic safety education programs,î said Perdue.† ìSpeeding and reckless driving are the leading causes of traffic deaths involving teenagers in our state.† Operation Drive to Live 2009 will help in our efforts to reverse that trend.î

During the past four years, 554 teenagers were killed in crashes investigated by the Highway Patrol.† Many collisions involving teenage drivers occur during their commute to and from high school.† Speed is the leading cause of teenage traffic deaths.

During Operation Drive to Live 2009, troopers will be enforcing all traffic laws around the stateís schools and conducting traffic safety education programs at the high schools. Troopers will be looking for violations such as speeding, following too closely, careless and reckless driving, and any violation of the motor vehicle laws that can result in serious injury or death.

Motorists may report dangerous driving to the Highway Patrol by dialing *HP on their cellular phones from anywhere in the state.† For more information about Operation Drive to Live 2009, visit the N.C. Department of Crime Control and Public Safetyís website at <http://www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp>www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp.

How is the 9% budget cut going to be attained?  Hopefully you are not laying any of the state workers off to achieve that. My suggestion would be to  look at some top executives and their salaries and see if they can take pay-cuts.  Also, cut out positions thru attrition; some positions may not be needed to be re-filled.
Thanks,
Bina

I am not in support of the stimulus package passed by our spend. As far as I am concerned this is blood money.  This is money that is going to take the blood and tears of my grandchildren and their children to pay back in the decades to come.  How could Congress have passed legislation they have not even read? That is not only outrageous it is irresponsible  . The Governor should not be supporting such behavior, but should be calling for a repeal of this legislation so that it can be read, evaluated, analyzed and discussed as to its validity and economic stimulus worth to out nation,  So far I have not found any reason to support our new Governor or President.  I am wishing them success, but that appears to be a wish that will never come true. I no longer say "God Bless American" I now say "God Please Save America."

Governor Launches NCRecovery.gov!

Governor Perdue today launched <http://www.NCRecovery.gov>www.NCRecovery.gov, a guide to services of the newly created Office of Economic Recovery & Investment.† NCRecovery.gov will let visitors track federal recovery funds in North Carolina, as well as learn about local contract and grant opportunities.

"I am committed to providing the people of North Carolina with a simple-to-navigate guide that is efficient, transparent and accountable,î Perdue said. ìI want the people of North Carolina to understand exactly how the money will be used to put North Carolina back to work.î

The website will serve as a resource on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, its impact on North Carolina and information about the state Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.† In the upcoming weeks, visitors will be able to track recovery†money as it is spent, suggest projects for funding and learn how to apply for contracts and grants that may be available.


First Round of Road and Bridge Projects Announced

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue announced the first 70 highway and bridge projects†that†soon will be under way using $466 million in federal economic†recovery funds.†† The†NC Department of Transportation has been working with local planning organizations across the state to determine which projects will be funded by the federal economic recovery dollars.†

The money is the first half that the state will receive for highway improvements through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.† The new federal law requires states to obligate the first half of transportation†recovery money within 120 days of receipt and the remaining half to projects within a year.† The biggest factor in determining†which projects were funded was whether the projects can be under contract by June along with safety, mobility, infrastructure health, and equitable distribution.

The second half of stimulus-related road and bridge projects is expected to be announced in the next 45 days.† According to state transportation officials, this current round of infrastructure investment will create approximately 14,000 jobs for the state.


Governor takes additional steps to manage the budget shortfall

As†part of her ongoing efforts to manage the current budget shortfall, Governor Perdue asked most state agencies for further budget cuts from 7 percent to 9 percent.† At the same time,†the Governor†will continue to protect public education as much as possible while managing the shortfall.

As a precautionary step to manage cash flow, the state will transfer up to $300 million dollars from several special accounts into the General Fund.† The money will be put into a reserve and may be used to support General Fund obligations if necessary. These transfers will be managed so that existing activities supported by these special funds aren't impacted.†


2011 Figure Skating National Championship Coming to Greensboro

Greensboro was selected to host the 2011 U.S. Figure Skating Championships after a lengthy and rigorous selection process.† Approximately 1,500 top skaters from across the country participate in the event. The Championships crown 12 national champions in four disciplines ñ men's singles, women's singles, pairs and ice dancing ñ across three competitive levels: novice, juniors and seniors. The Championships include eight days of competition and are featured on 10 hours of national network broadcast coverage. Recent host cities include Spokane, Washington (2007), St. Paul, Minnesota (2008), and Cleveland, Ohio (2009). The Championships typically generate more than 8,000 hotel room nights and previous hosts have calculated a local economic impact of approximately $30 million.

ìNorth Carolina will be a fantastic location for the 2011 Championships,î said Governor Perdue.† ìWe have a proven track record of successful major events, great facilities and wonderful volunteers. Not only will the Nationals showcase Greensboro and bring valuable dollars to the surrounding area, but the choice of North Carolina as the host state will make for the best possible event.î


Operation Drive to Live 2009

Governor Bev Perdue proclaimed February 23-27 as Teen Safe Driving week and†announced that the N.C. Highway Patrol is kicking off Operation Drive to Live 2009†to reduce teenage traffic fatalities and collisions.

ìThe Highway Patrol is determined to reduce teenage fatal collisions in North Carolina by enforcing all traffic laws around the stateís high schools and conducting traffic safety education programs,î said Perdue.† ìSpeeding and reckless driving are the leading causes of traffic deaths involving teenagers in our state.† Operation Drive to Live 2009 will help in our efforts to reverse that trend.î

During the past four years, 554 teenagers were killed in crashes investigated by the Highway Patrol.† Many collisions involving teenage drivers occur during their commute to and from high school.† Speed is the leading cause of teenage traffic deaths.

During Operation Drive to Live 2009, troopers will be enforcing all traffic laws around the stateís schools and conducting traffic safety education programs at the high schools.

All of this is good, but we are still without a hospital and a toll-free 540 in south Wake county, and we read of no positive action here.
