Governor Perdue To Release Proposed Budget Tomorrow

Gov. Bev Perdue will release her proposed FY 2009-11 Budget tomorrow morning at 11:30am.  In the midst of a global economic crisis, writing this budget hasn't been easy.  Governor Perdue has had to make difficult decisions about where to cut and where to invest.

Throughout the process she has made education a priority.  The budget proposal will actually include an increase in per-pupil spending on education.  Governor Perdue has also focused on programs that will create jobs for North Carolina workers and protect public safety.

Tomorrow at 11:30am, please visit our website, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/>http://www.governor.state.nc.us/, to read the budget or to watch the press conference live.

THANK YOU so much for your efforts to bring more transparency to NC state government.  I have just learned that those on the Certificate of Need board are now subject to the state ethics guidelines.  I supported your campaign in the past and will continue to do so in the future!

Why did the Governor include increased taxes on tobacco products in her budget proposal?  Does she not care about protecting jobs in our state?  Is it a desire to turn tobacco into the next textile job loss model?

     Dear Governor Perdue:

     Having not seen your proposed budget at this point, let me take just a moment to respond directly to the N&O
     article of today.  Thank you for making education your top priority.  You will recall it was my reason for
     spending eight years in the House.  There is no question you have a monumental task ahead of you; I do not
     foresee this economy turning around until the latter part of this year, if then.  I know first hand what that means
     when you do not have revenues to meet ongoing and/or proposed programs.  After all, I was there chairing the
     Education Base Budget Appropriations Committee during the last major recession ('81-'83).  I do not envy the
     position in which you find yourself.  If I can be of assistance in any way, all you need do is call or email me.
     Joe Hackney is a great guy and a good friend.  He will help you get through this.

     Warmest regards,

        Malcolm

Governor Perdue,

  I am Nancy Veitch from Morehead City NC. We met last year while campaigning. I have a babysitting service and nanny agency and I am wondering if there is any state stimulus money available for child care for the military at Camp Lejeune and Cherry Point that I could apply for. Can you help me? Thank you. Nancy Veitch

The state could make the $8000 tax credit available to home buyers at closing by making a loan to buyer then being repaid when buyer files tax return.  What do you think about this idea?  Other states are doing this to help revive economy.  Give me a call.  I will be glad to help.

PLease do not cut the state program that helps offenders stay out of prison and beat drugs- Program costs $2.7 million and treats 1,000 people- this should be expanded. Cuts shall be made in prison food, and amenities such as tv and phone priveleges- books shall be provided at any cost for they can be reused. Any prisoner that has an uncurable cancer once it is diagnosed treatment shall be palliative and no long term solution given. These are people who have not served society but harmed it-!

My name is LeAnne Kittrell.
You still have not answered my question.  Governor Perdue is the Commander and Chief of the North Carolina National Guard.
I want to know from the Governor why our familes have been denied re-enlistment bonuses.
I need it in writing from her as Commander and Chief.
I would like an appointment with the Governor.   I have some particular issues to discuss with her.
Once again, My particular issue is in reference to the North Carolina National Guardsmen of the 30th Brigade Heavy Combat Unit and their re-enlistment bonuses.  We received a letter stating they would get their Re-enlistment bonuses.
I want an answer as to why they have been denied.
Our soldiers in the NC Guard has served our state and our country for as long as the Governor has.
I am not quitting until the Governor responds to our 30th Brigade North Carolina soldiers that fight not only in State and from abroad.
If I do not get a real answer then I have no choice, but to take all these saved e-mails to the national level.
I just want to be recongzied as an honorable soldiers wife.  I need the Governor to respond directly to our familes issue.
Thank you,
LeAnne Kittrell

You see, that's the problem with government, they don't listen to the people worth a DAMN!

What part of, "SEND NO MORE BULLSHIT HERE!" IS IT THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND?

Is it the BULLSHIT PART you can't grasp? I think you got that part right, we're fed that all the time.
Maybe it's the SEND part, or maybe it's the NO.
I know you can understand the MORE, tax increases and spending says that you know the MORE part.

Governor Perdue To Release Proposed Budget Tomorrow

Gov. Bev Perdue will release her proposed FY 2009-11 Budget tomorrow morning at 11:30am.  In the midst of a global economic crisis, writing this budget hasn't been easy.  Governor Perdue has had to make difficult decisions about where to cut and where to invest.

Throughout the process she has made education a priority.  The budget proposal will actually include an increase in per-pupil spending on education.  Governor Perdue has also focused on programs that will create jobs for North Carolina workers and protect public safety.

Why is it so hard for a 62  year old white woman on Social Security to get a driver's license. Even with a passport. What a joke.

Okay, I sent this office an e-mail more than 2 weeks ago expecting a response.  In fact, I got an e-mail stating that a response would be sent as soon as possible.  Now, not only do I still not have a response to my e-mail, but I am (was) on the e-mail list for bulk e-mails.  My original e-mail was regarding the use of the State plane by Gov. Perdue during tough economic times to Jacksonville when President Obama spoke a couple of weeks.

Gov. Perdue,
Thanks for your visit to Western NC. I live in Clay County, the "far west". One thing that handicaps us is that we have difficulty getting coverage of North Carolina. Satellite and cable tv will not give Asheville and UNCTV in most of Region A. The Asheville Citizen-Times has limited coverage. Most TV and newspaper coverage is out of Atlanta and Chattanooga. Please help us address this issue. 
I lived in Raleigh most of my Ministry as a UM pastor. I served for 14 years as Pres./CEO of the Methodist Home for Children in Raleigh. We moved here in 2000. I have served as Chair of the Region A Partnership for Children. I appreciate your support for early childhood issues. 
All the best,
Rufus H Stark II

I contacted the governor several weeks ago about some issues I was unhappy about with the current budget and rather than getting a personal reply back from her I get placed on her mailing list. Please let the governor know that if she decides to ignore the voices of the people of NC her stay in office will be a very short one. 

Thanks for your time,
Jason Burton

MAY BE PERDUE NEEDS TO LOOK INTO THE CROCKEDNESS OF THE POLICE AND COURT HOUSES IN NC. I'VE LIVED ALOT OF PLACES IN THE US AND HAVE YET TO SEE IT THIS BAD. TROOPERS AN CITY AND COUNTY ALIKE THAT WOULD GO TO COURT AND LIE ON THE STAND JUST TO MAKE A CHARGE STICK. AND FOR THE JUDGE TO SAY, " THIS IS A MAN OF THE LAW" WHY DO YOU THINK I WOULD TAKE YOUR WORD OVER HIS. AND GIVE THEM, [OFFICERS] A FREE RAIN ON DOING THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I WAS A OFFICER FOR 8 YEARS AND KNOW HOW BAD THE JOB CAN BE, AND THE TYPE OFF PEOPLE YOU DEAL WITH ON DAY TO DAY. BUT IT SEEMS THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE IN THE SAME BOAT NOW, THEY JUST WANT YOUR MONEY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, IT'S EVERYONE NOT JUST THE BAD ONES ANYMORE. AS I WAS TOLD BY A NC TROOPER THEY HAVE A QUOTA NOW. IF THEY PULL YOU THEY HAVE TO WRITE A TICKET. THEY SIT ON THE SIDE OF ROADS WITH A LOOKING DEVISES AND PULL YOU OVER FOR A SEAT BELT, BECAUSE THEY SAY THERE IS NO WAY OUT OF A SEAT BELT TICKET, UNLIKE A SPEEDING TICKET. ITS A SHAME THAT LAYERS ARE GETTING RICH OFF THIS TOO. I'VE WATCH ALOT OF SHADY THINGS GOING ON IN THE LAST 5 YEAR THAT I'VE LIVE HERE, AND HAVE BROUGHT IT UP TO HIRE UP, TO BE SWEEP UNDER THE RUG OR TOLD THAT THAT TYPE OF THING CAN'T BE GOING ON. NOW I BELEAVE YOU DON'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST. WELL GOV. HOPEFULLY SOME DAY THE HIRE UP WILL OPEN THEIR EYE, AND SAY ENOUPH, THESE PEOPLE DO PAY OUR WAGES, WE WORK FOR THEM, WE ARE HERE TO SERV. THEM AND HELP THEM NOT JUST HARRASS THEM. BY THE WAY YES I GOT ONE OF THE SEAT BELT TICKETS AND PAYED MY FINE. IT WASN'T THE TICKET OR THE FINE THAT REALLY PISSED ME OFF, IT WAS THE CROCKED WAY THEY WENT ABOUT IT IN THE COURT ROOM TRYING TO MAKE IT STICK. THAT SPARKED MY INTERST IN WATCHING THEM IN HOW THEY CONDUCT BUSS. NOW BEING RETIRED I HAVE TIME ON MY HANDS TO WATCH AND SIT IN COURT ROOMS TO SEE WHAT REALLY GO'S ON. THAT BEFORE I JUST HEARD PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT AND THOUGHT ITS NOT THAT BAD BECAUSE ITS NOT HAPPENING TO ME, OR THERES NO WAY THIS CAN BE HAPPENING. WELL TO MY SERPRIZE ITS WERST THEM I COULD EVERY DREAMED. DO WE NOW NEED POLICE TO WATCH THE POLICE. OH ! INTERNAL AFFAIRS YEA RIGHT! ALL I GOT FOR COMPLAINING WAS HARRASSMENT. I KNOW DON'T ROCK THE BOAT UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET WET!!
    JUST A LINE TO MAYBE OPEN SOME EYES ON THE HIGHER UP SIDE, THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED FOR THE TAX PAYERS VEIWS. OR AGAIN JUST SWEEP UNDER THE RUG LIKE THEY HAVE FOR YEARS. I KNOW THERE IS NO EASY ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM BUT IT IS NOT ONE THAT SEEMS TO BE GOING AWAY OR GETTING ANY BETTER. I ALSO KNOW THAT ALL OUR GOVERMENT ENITYS ARE IN NEED OF MONEY, BUT IT SEEMS THERE WOULD BE MUCH CLEANER WAYS OF REACHING THIS BUDGET, WITHOUT PUTTING MORE PEOPLES HOMES, FOOD, AND LIVING IN JEPREDY. IT HARD ENOUPH FOR THE AVERAGE FAM. TO MAKE IT, WITH JOBS BEING HARD TO FIND, BILLS GETTING HIGHER AND HIGHER, LETS TRY TO HELP THE PEOPLE KEEP THEIR HOMES, JOBS, AND MONEY TO LIVE ON, AND NOT SUPPORT THE COURT HOUSES AND GOVERMENT HIGH PAYING JOBS. WELL  I'M SURE YOUR SAYING ENOUPH FROM THIS CRY BABY THAT CAN'T EVEN SPELL VERY WELL. WELL I'M 50 WITH 2 STROKES, SO THINGS DON'T WORK AND SPELL AS WELL AS THEY USED TOO. BUT I'M SURE YOU GET THE IDEA.
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME
MR. REED

I hope by her focusing on Education that she is getting the worthless NEA out of the picture and giving money directly to the school districts.  All the NEA will do is take 90% of the money for themselves.  Also, don't put all the weight on the teachers shoulders.  Education begins at home, and from what I have seen, most parents don't have above an 8th grade reading level.

Good morning Governer-



I sent an email previously, but have not seen a reply other than this bulk email. So I offer the following:



I live in Franklin County. Last year our county overwhelmingly passed a school bond for $53,000,000. Funding included ADM and Lottery proceeds, totaling a projected amount of $500,000 per year as part of the payback. I am both a county resident and the architect for the work. I can tell you all drawings are now “shovel ready” and are now on hold due to county officials trying to understand the impact of the action taken by your office to seize the funds they had intended to utilize. IF WE NEED JOBS NOW, it would seem a small investment to free up the above moneys so that our County might make such a large investment ($53,000,000 over the next 2 years) into much needed county infrastructure.



In order to keep on schedule, the county needs to make a decision by April 22, 2009.



PLEASE see what you can do regarding these large shovel ready projects, as I am sure there are more around the state.



Thank you for your consideration.



Jon Long

Youngsville, NC

THE FALLACY OF PRO-LIFE STANCE



Ron A. Virmani, M.D.



The central theme of pro-life dogma is the sanctity of human life.  Many religions including Christianity, Muslim etc. hold this view.  On the surface, it is a very noble view.  But can it really be applied to human existence over a long run?  What would happen if we banned all abortions and applied todayâ€™s technology to save every life or potential life as per the wishes of â€œpro-lifeâ€ community?



Thomas Malthus(1766-1834) observed in Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) that in nature plants and animals produce far more offspring than can survive, and that Man too is capable of overproducing if left unchecked. Malthus concluded that unless family size was regulated, manâ€™s misery of famine would become globally epidemic and eventually consume Man.  Malthus held the view that poverty and famine were natural outcomes of population growth.



The population of the world was 1 billion in 1800, it became 2 billion in 1927and 6 billion in 1999.  It is continuing to grow at an exponential rate. 

It will only take 25 years for there to be 2 billion more people on this planet.



Are 6.7 billion inhabitants of our planet living a decent life today?



One billion people on this planet do not have access to drinkable water!  Two billion people live in abject poverty making less than two dollars a day!  In many parts of the world, people live in squalid conditions, with utter hopelessness and despair.  This gives rise to many social problems such as abuse of men, women and children.  Nature and animals are exploited.  This further erupts into a cycle of drugs, violence, prostitution and corruption that unravels the fabric of global society at all levels.  What Malthus predicted is coming true!



The general state of civilization is pitiful.  A privileged few control and enjoy the riches of the planet.  Meanwhile the masses struggle.  Polarization of resources as well as pollution is unprecedented.  Mother earth can no longer deal with the average carbon footprint of 4 tons per capita.  This translates into 25 billion tons of greenhouse gases per year!  The cumulative effect is immense global warming and slow death of the planet.  Rainforests and species of animals and plants are disappearing rapidly.



Not only is the population increasing, but also people are living longer.  Throw in the Western philosophy of unbridled consumerism and you have a demand pattern outstripping the supply by an ever widening margin.  The planet, thereby, is in peril.  We, the human beings, are indeed, the cancer of the planet, sucking up the oxygen and the nutrients faster than it can regenerate.



Let us look at U.S. alone.  The population of U.S. was 75 million in 1933, now it is 4 times.  Each person probably consumes at least 10 times the resources compared to that time.  So in essence, we, as a nation are consuming 40 times the resources as compared to 100 years ago!  This can not go on!



Now let us assume that pro-life concept prevailed and Roe v. Wade (January 1973) never occurred.  There would be additional 50 million children being born.  If half of them had two children each, that would mean there would be 100 million more people in the U.S. right now.  Imagine that!  Spending $20,000 per birth, our collective tab would be $2 trillion!



Because all these unwanted babies would be born to mothers unwilling or unable to care for them, many would lead miserable lives.  Many would turn to crime and violence and end up in prisons.  Right now, 2 million people are in jail.  Without Roe v. Wade, that number could easily be 4 million.  The state spends a large sum of money on criminal justice plus $35,000 to house each prisoner per year.  Therefore, the tab without Roe v. Wade could easily be extra $100 billion per year! 



There is yet another part of the pro-life movement.  They support continued support of terminally ill patients, even in a vegetative state. 



All this would simply bankrupt our nation.  We would be living in a crime-ridden over-crowded society.  We may do well to recall that before Roe v. Wade, 1000 women died from illegal abortions in the U.S. each year. 



If we extrapolate this picture to the entire world, it is easy to see that the resources of the planet would get wiped out in no time.  International wars would break out and the human population will come to a turbulent end. 



We can only conclude that pro-life stance is not compatible with long term survival of human and other species on this planet.  I hope that our nation can get beyond the emotions and grasp the facts that are essential to sustaining our very existence.

Governor Perdue To Release Proposed Budget Tomorrow

Gov. Bev Perdue will release her proposed FY 2009-11 Budget tomorrow morning at 11:30am.  In the midst of a global economic crisis, writing this budget hasn't been easy.  Governor Perdue has had to make difficult decisions about where to cut and where to invest.

Throughout the process she has made education a priority.  The budget proposal will actually include an increase in per-pupil spending on education.  Governor Perdue has also focused on programs that will create jobs for North Carolina workers and protect public safety.

Tomorrow at 11:30am, please visit our website, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/>http://www.governor.state.nc.us/, to read the budget or to watch the press conference live.

I think the reassigning to the dollars from the stimulus plan that were specifically set assign for centers for independent living is WRONG. The National Council for Independent Living  worked long and hard in Washington to have the dollars included for Centers For Independent Living who have a long and successful track record for  transiting people out of nursing homes.  But in North Carolina the State Independent Living program which operates with Vocational Rehabilitation in fact has a pitiful record.  Now just like AIG they are getting a bonus for a total failure.  The National Council For Independent Living of which we are a member did not advocate for this portion of the stimulus money to go to the Designated State Unit and the legislation does not call for that. Put the dollars where they will do some good… the Centers for Independent Living in North Carolina.  I want Governor Perdue to have a good administration and excellent term in office,  but the more she listens to the bureaucrats in Voc Rehab and the State Independent Living program the more she plunges headlong down the road of failure.  And I hate that.
