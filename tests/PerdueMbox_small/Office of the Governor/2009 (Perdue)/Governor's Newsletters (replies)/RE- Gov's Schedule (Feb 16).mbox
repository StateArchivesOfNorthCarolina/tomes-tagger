Thanks!  This is a small but very effective way to make the work of
government real for average citizens.  Any chance staff could help her
keep a blog with her impressions from some of these meetings?

Governor Perdue,


     Please visit the alternative school in Caswell County.  It is a title one school and the students in the middle grades program must teach themselves science using a computerized program.  Aren't they entitled to highly qualified certified teachers in order to receive a free appropriate public education.  Please investigate!


Thanks,
Judy Loftis, NBCT

This is an incredibly great idea. It's a shame all citizens may not be able to receive this communication. As well, it may be a shame that there may be those receiving it that may not take the time to open and read it.

Thanks for including me on the distribution list.

Governor Perdue,
With the impending stimulus package being signed on Tuesday, February 17, I would like to ask you to consider the following.  If the money the state receives is to be used to stimulate North Carolina's economy and provide jobs to it workers, I want you to see if you can keep that money in North Carolina and our country?  Workers from outside of our borders most here without proper papers will take jobs legal citizens could occupy and then will send US dollars out of the country to support their families in other countries.  I cannot see how this will help stimulate our economy.  I would ask you to consider placing restrictions on the use of this money to create jobs for legal US citizens.  If illegal workers are hired, then the funding source should not apply and be revoked.  Right here in Dare County many workers that are taking jobs from citizens are in our county and country illegally.  You promised changes, I think it is time for you and other state leaders to take a stand on what is happening in our country with illegal workers, especially in light of the stress it is causing for our health care systems, social services and school systems.
C.P. "Buster" Nunemaker, III

Every time I receive emails from the Govenor's office they are corrupt and I can not read them. I contacted my administrator and he said he could not fix the problem. Any suggestions?

Is it possible for me to meet or talk with Governor Perdue before her meeting with SEANC Friday? My ideas have to do with the BUDGET.

  I understand that Governor Perdue is trying to have transparency in her administration, but is it wise from a security standpoint to publish her schedule?
Maybe you should just announce what she did after she does it.  I do not mean to be presumptuous, but I am concerned with this new idea.

what the heck is an "ethics refresher meeting?"  that sounds like a waste of tax money and time.  if y'all are ethically sound, I doubt a few hours on a friday is going to change anything.

You should really work on things here in NC as my father just passed in January.  If he had not been pushed back from the resources he needed for the last almost five years he would still be here.  He fought  for his health as long as he could and died at the age of 56.  Very young to die.  He fought for disability for over 4 years and fought for medicaid for a lengthy time as well.  He got a letter of total disability and our great state and country still failed him.  He was proud to be an American and did everything he could to fight for his life and just could not afford the bills and doctors so he didn't go like he should.  If he had just got some medical help or disability like he should have received he would still be here.  He could have caught the different things changing in his body and he would have been able to get a heart transplant and many other things could have been different.  I feel he was let down and we need to do more to help other people who are in the same situations.  I wish they would get things together for the people who really need help.  My father lived the last almost five years of his life with only twenty percent of his heart (documented that is) he could have lived with his heart like this much longer for all we knew.  He only had a twenty percent ejection fraction for the last almost five years.  He was written a letter of total disability by his heart doctor and the social security still would not approve him for disability.  I feel like taking his remains down to the judges office and ask him does he still think he could work in his condition as he has passed on.  Then maybe he will be a little better at his decisions.  We have several people who are on disability for not being able to cope in a group of people due to anxiety and they have mental problems.  But we can't help a man with these kind of heart problems and diabetes, low blood pressure, high cholesterol and many more things.  We are not helping the right people.  If we could help these types of  people and make them better we could put them back to work one day and the mentally challenged or unstable can be on disability for life with no hopes of going back to work.  I think we need to change some of the laws to reflect a time frame that the mentally unstable or anxiety people are allowed to be on disability and start looking more into the unhealthy people who really could use the help.  If only we could reach the ones that need to go to the doctors we could make a difference in them and they could eventually get better and possibly go back to work.  Where there is not a real good or effective way to judge mental and anxiety problems which could actually be faked.  I feel like we need to look more into the health records and maybe we could help more people.
Thanks,
Merrill Riser

This is quite impressive and speaks well to Gov. Perdue’s commitment to “open government”. It validates her pledge and sets an excellent example for all leaders, political and private sector.

Dear Governor,
As Rev. Barber intoned this weekend, please, don't budget on the backs of the poor.
We have had massive social security for the largest banks and financial institutions, now it is the turn of the poor to benefit from the tax payments they have made to sustain the massive national debt.
I am sure that you agree.
Sincerely,
Michael Carmichael

Dear Gov. Perdue and Office Staff,

    As a long-time older-age (84 years) committed Democrat who has been active and concerned about citizen involvement in our governmental processes -- national, state, and local -- your messages warrant acknowledgment.

    My appreciation for your contact with "the people of North Carlina" defies description.
Thank you for caring and keeping us informed about what is going on in our state!!  This tax-payer, supporter, believer in "government of, by and for the people" is grateful.

    Please keep 'em coming in spite of the time and trouble it takes to do so.  Do not let yourselves think, for one moment, that this kind of voter-contact is unimportant.  (Double negative -- but you get my point, I am sure!)

    Pearl Berlin
    4202 Cilgerran Court
    High Point, NC  27265

I am not interested in Gov. Perdue's schedule. I am requesting that she look into the fact that the children at West Carteret HS have to eat there lunch on the hall floors. I think this is a disgrace. I know this is a hard time for money but the politicians are never broke.

HOW PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL TURNED MILLIONAIRE INTO SLUMDOG IN CHARLOTTE

Ron A. Virmani, M.D.



On September 1, 1995, Presbyterian hospital called me to their imposing corporate Board Room in Charlotte, NC and dropped a bomb on me.  They said they were summarily suspending my hospital privileges at 4 PM that day!



Suspension from a hospital is a kiss of death for any physician!  Without hospital privileges, I could never deliver another baby nor help women in need of gynecologic surgery.  My future went blank in front of my eyes! 



I knew that they had been reviewing my charts for several months now.  But they never gave me a chance to explain my actions and defend my charts as required by hospitalâ€™s own by-laws.  This was truly a stab in the back. 



â€œWe do not have to tell you what the charts are.â€  Said then CEO of Presbyterian hospital Mr. Paul Betzold and chief of ob-gyn Dr. Ronald Brown.  They simply stated that I had 24 â€œproblematicâ€ charts, as determined by the peer review committee. 



Having migrated from India, I had received my M.D. from New Jersey Medical School in 1985 and finished my ob-gyn residency from Temple University hospital in 1989.  I had come to Charlotte in 1990 and become a member of Presbyterian hospital medical staff as an ob-gyn physician.



On December 1994, I had a surgical mishap.  Inadvertently, I punctured the external iliac artery in a patient during laparoscopy.  This was unfortunate but a known complication of such a procedure.  I immediately proceeded to laparotomy and summoned Dr. John Hollenbeck (general surgeon) and Dr. Scott Andrews (cardiovascular surgeon) to assist me.  We repaired the injury and the patient went home after a few days stay in the hospital.  My malpractice insurance company as well as several independent reviewers determined that I met the standard of care in this case.  However, citing business reasons, the insurance company later decided to settle the lawsuit for 300K.



Following the incident, Presbyterian hospital went on a fishing expedition of my charts from over a two year period.  Most of these charts had been filed in the hospital archives as having no quality of care issues.  Anyway, a departmental â€œpeer reviewâ€ committee headed by Dr. James Hardy nitpicked and labeled 24 of them â€œproblematicâ€ out of my 102 charts reviewed.



The Medical Board of North Carolina asked an experienced ob-gyn physician from Charlotte, Dr. Kenneth Chambers to review my cases.  He as well as several other reviewers found my charts to be within the standard of care. 



According to a letter circulated by Dr. Jared Schwartz in October 1998 among the hospitalâ€™s medical staff, I was the first physician to be suspended in 20 years at Presbyterian hospital!  Was it just a coincidence that I was the first ob-gyn physician of Indian origin at Presbyterian hospital?  I went to the local courts and dug up medical malpractice cases.  I found out the following facts, which are true to the best of my knowledge.



Dr. W. Wortman injured a patientâ€™s bladder at a laparoscopy.  The jury found him negligent and awarded the Plaintiff $100,000. (92-CVS-16674)



Dr. Kenneth Baker performed a laparscopic surgery in October 1993 at Union Memorial Hospital.  An injury to the intestine was not recognized at this time.  Patient presented later with abdominal abscess and died.  (Union County 95 CVS 01325) Dr. Baker performed another laparoscopy in November 1994 at which time a bowel perforation was not recognized.  She died of sepsis.  (Union County, 96 CVS 00992)  Presbyterian hospital had no problem subsequently giving Dr. Baker privileges in ob-gyn department.



Dr. Whitesides performed a laser laparoscopy on a patient in 1995 (99- CVS-5141).  The patient complained of abdominal pain on December 2 and 3, the physician prescribed stool softener.  On December 4, she passed out and the husband had to carry her.  An exploratory laparotomy and hemicolectomy was done.  Suit also named Nalle clinic.



Dr. C. Ellington performed a laser laparoscopy in September 1991 on a patient and perforated her small bowel.  She underwent multiple subsequent surgeries and became unable to eat and drink.  She was placed on TPN (intravenous nutrition).  The suit also named Bradford Clinic and PHAC.  (94-CVS-11679)



Dr. John Tidwell performed a laparoscopy on a patient who died from overwhelming sepsis six days later.  (97-CVS-1707)  Dr. Tidwell also failed to respond to nurseâ€™s pages for another patient in labor in August 1989.  The infant suffered severe physical and neurological injuries.  (92-CVS-11209)



Dr. A J Lewis failed to manage fetal distress during labor in 1992, the parties named (Dr. Lewis and Mintview ob-gyn) settled for $5M in May 1995.



Drs. M. Torres and K Stephens were performing a hysterectomy at Presbyterian hospital, while managing a labor patient at Carolinas Medical Center in September 1995.  They failed to respond to fetal distress in time.  The baby was born with zero apgars and died 16 hours after birth.(96-CVS-9576)



Dr. W. McDonald failed to assess fetal distress in February 1987.  The result was severe physical and neurological injuries.  (96-CVS-7927).



Dr. Alice Teague delayed performing a c/section after unsuccessful vacuum extraction of a baby with much fundal pressure.  The baby was born with birth asphyxia and skull fracture.  The jury awarded Plaintiff 23.2 million.  The hospital settled separately for $6M.  (95-CVS-13212)



These cases are only the tip of the iceberg of adverse events involving Presbyterian physicians.  I know of no disciplinary action against these physicians by the hospital.  They kept on practicing at Presbyterian hospital.  Some are still there.  In fact, some of them sat in my judgment. 



In 1996, I filed a state court case for breach of the by-laws.  The hospital started a new review, ordered by the court, using outside reviewers, but then suppressed their findings!  They started yet another internal review, which found 25 of my charts to be problematic.  However, 10 of these charts were different from the original 24 charts! 



In 1998, after the letter from Dr. Schwartz circulated, I realized that I was targeted because of ethnic prejudice.  In January 1999, I filed a discrimination case in the federal court.  The hospital attorneys dragged the case for so long that the original judge died.  A new judge was assigned. 



However, out of nowhere, Judge Mullen, apparently sympathetic to the hospital, appeared and grabbed the case form the new judge.  He kicked out my federal lawsuit stating that I should have pleaded discrimination in the original state court case in 1996!  At that time, I had no evidence of  discrimination!  So much for spending eleven long years in the courts and a million dollars in legal fees!  My career has been destroyed for ever!



Even though North Carolina Medical Board found my cases meeting the standard of care and said they would help me, they never did.  All national, state, local medical organizations and leaders in the community have stood on the sidelines watching the travesty of justice.  The peer review was a complete sham!



After I filed a suit alleging discrimination, Presbyterian hospital became sensitized to the issue of diversity.  They made alliance with Charlotte Medical Society, made up of African-American and minority doctors.  They started sending their employees to diversity workshops.  But they do not even think about rehabilitating my destroyed career and life!  Damn the Indian!  I have struggled with my sweat and blood for 13 years and become a martyr just like Dr. M.L.K. Jr.  I am left in the dust, over which the hospital is proclaiming its newfound love for diversity, rewarding many other minority physicians but continuing to completely ignore me.



In this state and the country, an undercurrent of racism exists in the medical field.  Bad physicians of the politically correct persuasions are allowed to practice based on their clout.  Good physicians, who are not part of the â€œgood old boys clubâ€ and not approved by the powers that be, are disciplined and thrown to dogs.  The â€œpeer reviewâ€ system is used by the physicians to protect their own and destroy the disenfranchised.  This does not bode well for the health care of the citizens of this country.

I would be content if you could get someone to clean up the median on I-40 between here and Durham.  There is the front end of a Pontiac that has been there for 3 months, plus other debris.  It is a safety hazard.

Hello,

  A few weeks ago I sent an e-mail to you from the State’s web site about a donation of art from James DeMolyneux to a State museum. I have not heard back from anyone. Will someone please contact me about this donation? It is a sizable one.

Thank you for the schedule,

Dear Gov. Perdue,

I'm sort of an independent lobby for mental health here in Western North Carolina.  Since the State divested mental health in 2003, the non-profit and for-profit agencies who stepped in to provide services have struggled.  I agree that many that have gone belly up were ill-conceived and short-funded with business practices that left much to be desired.  However, budget cuts across the board have penalized the efficient and conscientious providers as well.  In addition past diversions of funds allocated for mental health further stripped remaining providers of the ability to provide quality services efficiently.  I'd like to suggest an incentive program for mental health agencies whereby those measuring up over a determined period of time can receive a State grant for either their existing programs or new programs.  Meanwhile I'd like to commend this current administration for its open and apparent zealous commitment to the betterment of government here in North Carolina.  Jean B.

What about Charlotte, NC?  What about our ridiculous road conditions?  What about the lack of educational resources in Charlotte.  What need affordable day-cares, we need an alternate to the Pre-K for kids that pass the screening.  You get penalized if you have actually taught your child something then they don't get into the free program.  We are the biggest city in North Carolina I think because of egos everything remains business as usual while driving down the beautiful streets of Raleigh.  While our streets are full of holes and traffic is growing with the city.  We have all these people moving here from Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania but hours of traffic on end in South Charlotte.  I regret voting for you already.

Rgds,
Tameka Proctor

Yikes! I'm concerned that the Sunday schedule offers no opportunity for prayer, praise, worship or just plain peace and quiet to contemplate the goodness of God and to rejoice that all good gifts come from Him! I'll pray for you and all our local and federal officials.
