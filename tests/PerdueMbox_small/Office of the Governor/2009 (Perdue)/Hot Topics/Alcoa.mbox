Subject: Lake levels at Badin Lake on the Yadkin River

Comment: Governor, As I believe you are aware, Alcoa Generating is attempting to get a 50 year right to draw down water to a level of five feet below full pond level rather than the normal three feet. This could cause some some serious problems to unknowing boaters or even more seriously for skiers. I have had first hand experience with a jet ski being beached on top of a metal plate that sticks up near the surface at a given lake level. There are both rocks and jagged stumps that can be just below, at or just above water level that can also be very dangerous. When the water level gets down to the five foot level, lives will be jeopardized. I've seen a boat that hit an obstacle and had a gash down one side that cost a substantial amount of money to repair. Badin is a beautiful lake and it would be a tragedy to allow lake levels to be lowered enough to cause endangerment of human life. As we understand it, this is all about money and how much power Alcoa can sell. Two feet of water can't make that much difference. Thanks for your consideration. Don Berrier 336-461-4457

Subject: Badin Lake vs Alcoa

Comment: Hi Miss. Perdue congratulations on the election first of all! Just a note letting know the concern of the citizens and property owners around Badin Lake stating our worries about Alcoa (a private company) controlling an entire river basin for there own greedy profits and gains. For the last 2 years my "lake front property" has been useless and dry and for the only reason of foresaid greed. The lakes just above Badin (Tuckertown and Tillery) remained full! Hummmm Alcoa clams "Drought" I clam BS pardon my french... Please please help the people of North Carolina have a safe place to go on weekends without the worry of stumps and boulders just below the waters surface. Hope you can help! Thank you James Tracy Davis

Subject: Illegal Imagrints

Comment: If the illegals in this state(and all others) were paying taxes would we be in the fix we are in ? It seems to me that if they were paying taxes our SCHOOLS, our roads and much more would not be in such a bad situation. I say legalize all of them and make them start paying taxes. Their use of our Welfare System and our Schools for free has a major impact on our economy. Also the money they our sending out of our country is a direct hit in the wallet. They send more money out of our country than they spend here. I have seen the numbers and they are overwhelming. How can our country,or state let them keep taking advantage of all of us?!!!!!!!

Subject: Alcoa Plans for Ruining Badin Lake

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue In this difficult real estate environment, we don't need additional challenges that reduce our home values even lower!! I have a lake-front home that is already valued nearly 10% lower than 3 years ago!!! With the Alcoa proposal to operate Badin Lake at 5 feet below full, my dock will be on dry land, and my beautiful home will potentially be worth less than my mortgage value!! Please don't allow Alcoa to put North Carolina citizens in more jeopardy to go upside-down on mortgages than we already are!! Please! Over 1500 North Carolina residents have sent letters to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) objecting to their proposal to allow Alcoa to lower normal operating water levels on Badin Lake (Narrows Reservoir) from 3 to 5 feet. We believe there were substantial errors in representing the interests of the people in the state during the license negotiations. FERC also failed to adequately recognize and evaluate the devastating effect in the local community of lower water levels on Badin Lake. We need your help and the help of our state agencies in preventing this from happening. To date FERC has not responded to our concerns. Alcoa is proposing to lower the normal operating level on Badin Lake from its existing 3 foot level to 5 foot. Neither FERC nor Alcoa have stated the reason why the decrease in operating level is necessary after 50 years of higher water levels. The proposed operation would allow the lake level to be lowered during periods of normal rainfall conditions when on average four times the amount of water flows into the lake than is required to flow out. The lake has been operated at 3 foot below full for the past 50 years and lowering the level to 5 feet will have a devastating effect on both the local community and visitors to the area. The water in the lake is a public resource that needs to be protected from the profit motivation of a private corporation. Lower water levels are particularly detrimental to water quality and pollution in the lake. Persistent fluctuations in the lake levels accelerate erosion and will stir up polluted sediments, reintroducing them into the lake system as well as transport polluted sediment down stream below the dam. Maintaining consistent higher water levels minimizes erosion, is good for water quality, good for the environment, good for fish and wildlife, and good for users of the lake. We can find no good reason why the state of North Carolina or its state agencies should not support our efforts to maintain more consistent water levels in Badin Lake. At the very least, the state should require Alcoa to maintain lake levels at its historic operating level of 3 foot below full pond during NON DROUGHT conditions. A slight increase in profit to a private corporation cannot be allowed to overshadow and destroy the social and economic well being of the local community. We are requesting your help to notify FERC that we are opposed to lowering normal water levels on Badin Lake. In light of recent pollution issues identified in Badin Lake, we are also requesting your help in obtaining the support of our state agencies to support the citizens of North Carolina who are concerned about these issues and their impacts on Badin Lake. We are not comfortable with the state granting the 401 Water Quality Certification and giving Alcoa a 50 year license until these important issues are resolved. Your help in obtaining a fair and equitable solution to this issue will be most appreciated.

Comment: As home owners at Badin Lake we are very concerned over Alcoa and FERC decision to relicence the normal operating water levels from 3ft to 5ft. below full pool. This would basically make our pier unsafe and we would be unable to use it. Realestate values are already suffering lets not make it worse by downgrading a beautiful natural resourse. please let us know where you stand on this important economic and ecological issue.

Dear Ms. Perdue,

Â·         Given the stateâ€™s budget shortfall and the overall economic troubles facing our nation, we must invest our tax dollars wisely and work to attract new businesses to our state.  The fact that Stanly County has spent $1 million in taxpayer money â€” and wants the State of North Carolina to spends hundreds of millions more to take over Alcoaâ€™s business â€” is very concerning. 

Efforts to take over the Yadkin Project set a dangerous precedent and are bad for business in

Hi, Mrs. Perdue
  My name in Lynwood Butler , I wanted to talk to you about the Yadkin
River situation. I have  worked for Alcoa for 32 years and have worked
for APGI for over 10 years ,I also work for Stanly County Sheriff's
office ,so I work for both sides of the debate . I would, as you would
like to see a win, win in this but don't think that will happen. Most of
all I am a tax payer in Stanly County too .I know this is something that
you would like to get resolved for everyone involved . The problem is
this has been going on for over 6 years now  and the county wants more
than Alcoa will give them .This isn't about water rights ,if it was then
the county would be talking about Progress Energy  also ,which is on the
same river as APGI's ,down a few miles and part of it is in Stanly
County too. It is about land and that is the bottom line .I may sound
like I'm for APGI only , but working at the dams as I do ,I know that
they go to a lot to make sure that the lakes are clean . I work on the
lakes as a Sheriff Deputy too . I see all the people who enjoys the lake
and know that if it wasn't for Alcoa ,that big lake wouldn't be there.
So if you will look behind the scene  and you will see it also. If you
would like to take a tour of our dams I can arrange it .or you may call
me at 704-422-5547


Thank you
