Comment: Give us a break! Enough is enough! If you want to charge additional taxes for additional income to the state, try taxing MacDonalds, Hardees, KFC, etc.. for obesity which is a NATIONAL CRISIS! I am tired of being blamed for the nations expenses. OBESITY IS A NATIONAL CRISIS!!! Stop charging me for my occasional enjoyment! I am really sick of all the taxes on tabacco!!! Sincerely Nancy Stevens P.S. And I am sick of seeing really FAT people around me that can't hardly walk to the MacDonalds or Hardee's that we are speaking of. I am 4'11" and weight 114 lbs. and can out walk or out work any of them. Think about it. Obesity is a MAJOR PROBLEM, BIGGER THAN MY HABIT. I am ALSO A TAX PAYER AND VOTER!!! Remember that come election time.I will be interested in your changes in policies. All I want is it to be fair to ALL!! NOT JUST TO TAX THE TABACCO USERS!! Because obesity is costing the state billions. Think about it!!! I look forward to any reply that you may have.You know I have tried to send this to you twice and hav not gotten any confirmation of delivery so, I DO NOT HAVE ANY FAITH IN ANY FURTHER EMAILS UNLESS YOU RESPOND TO CONFIRM MY EMAIL AS RECEIVED. I look forward to your response if any.

Subject: Bad Policies/Taxes

Comment: Good Morning, Governor Perdue's "sin" tax policy is a bad one. These numbers simply can not realistically rely on people smoking/drinking in order to raise tax money in an already wasteful system. Thanks to Mrs. Perdue, I've purchased my last pack of cigarettes this morning. Although she has helped me to stop smoking, the underyling wasteful spending problem still remains. Taxing something more will not fix this. Earmarks need to go. Only then can we resolve a lot of waste. You simply can not base a budget on fluctuation of numbers. Not good policy. Sincerly, Michael V. Cline

Comment: You are promoting increased taxes on alcohol & tobacco.....why???? I am not a smoker and I only have an occasional beer, so the tax will have very little effect on me. Is this to "punish" those people or is it just the "easiest" way for the State to increase its' revenue because we the State is better at managing our money than we are....I think not. LOOK AT OUR CURRENT BUDGET AND TRIM UNNECESSARY COSTS AND PROGRAMS. As a life-long North Carolinian, put me down as someone who is not a believer in how things are being run in Raleigh.

Subject: taxes uped for cigarettes

Comment: First off let me say I am sorry I voted for you. I really thought you would do a good job. But you havn't even been in office and have showed very poor work. Now on to the Taxes that you are puting on Cigarettes. I can prove that Alcohol kills more than someone that smokes. Smoking does not make someones life a living hello but Alcohol does. It has ruined so many lives from abruse to killing. Yes somking CAN cause cance. But it has not killed a child or a whole family. It hasn't abused a child when some one in the home is a aclcoholit and beats a child all the way thought thier life. Some don't make it or they grow up and drink them selfs. So not tell me that smoking CAN give someone lung cancer. When there is a child being beat every min from someone that drinks. Or you get a call that you Husban or wife-child mother dad the list goes on that has just been killed by a drunk driver. WHY must you up the taxes on cigarettes. They will not stop buying them. they will just not pay a bill to buy the cigarettes. You don't think. You don't like smoke so you do this cause it is a personal thing to you. You need to do more Taxes on ALCOHOL. OH yes you can't you don't want to pay more taxes on your wine that you drink. NC is pushing wine makers to make more wine. Something is very wrong with this picture. You need to think what you are doing. Kids will go with out cause mom and Dad will buy the high price cigarettes. No one has Taxed the Alcohol Why? cause most of the goverment drink it and it is run by the Groverment. Cigarettes are not. So Please do your homework and you will see I am telling you the truth. So sad you are taking away NC history. Not your friend Deborah Hunter Wallace,N.C.

Subject: Taxing low income people to balance budget

Comment: carton of cigarettes were at $ 27.99 before the Federal tax was added and you are proposing to add $ 10.00 per carton to that...a 35.7 % increase on cigarettes, but only a 5 % increase on alochol. More affluent people (like you) drink alocholic beverages and less affluent people (like me) smoke cigarettes. Is there a connection here? I know that smoking is not good for my health, but I suggest that you try working on the floor of a textile mill for 35 years and see if you become a smoker. I would like to suggest one way to get additional millions to help with the budget other than a new tax on cigarettes.... get the NC Revenue Dept. to collect the $ 505 million in unpaid taxes owed by tax scofflaws. Respectfully, Charles Rankin

Subject: Tobacco Tax Increase

Comment: Dear Governor: I first want to say I appreciate the tough challenges you face and wouldn't wish those upon anyone. But, I find your tax increase proposal on cigarettes and other tobacco products to be rather draconian. Hundreds of thousands of North Carolinian's employment is in some way connected to the tobacco industry. Your proposal of an excise increase of $1.00 per pack is a slap in the face to these proud North Carolinians who have dutifully supported this state for hundreds of years. It also unfairly punishes the million plus tobacco consumers in the state who already pay significant excise and sales taxes on the products they choose. Tobacco tax increases are a convenient and politically correct band aid to correct flawed budgeting errors. While I do not support any tax increase I am willing to share in some of the pain the state feels. But a $1.00 per pack increase is JUST PLAIN REDICULOUS! It's an insult to the great companies, farmers, processors, and dependents of the industry. But more importantly, it's a travesty to what silly policy does to adult tobacco users and the economy as a whole. I am outraged by such grievous misconduct in the Governor's Office and lack of thought or understanding at the losses in employment that this will create. The industry has created great value for this state over the last hundred years which goes completely unnoticed by your office. As it still does today. The industry provides stable good paying jobs and keeps our communities robust and growing. It is with all respect that I ask you to go back to your budget again and focus on policy items that will create jobs rather destroy jobs. The future of this state and country resides on our ability to grow and create jobs and compete. Not on silly, wasteful spending that creates dependency and unfairly punishes industry and individuals. Sincerely, Brice O'Brien

Comment: I was just wondering! If the tax on tobacco products has not been passed as of yet then why are we paying that extra dollar already been paying it for almost 2 weeks. The reason I was given was that because tobacco companies like RJ Reynolds and others are guessing it will pass so they have already went up so the stores that buy from them have to go up as well to cover the cost. Why are they doing this if the tax hasn't passed yet? Are they giving this money to the state or pocketing it? If the taxes pass fine raise it but can we wait to start charging people 1.00 more a pack untill the law has passed?

Subject: $1 a pack cigarette tax increase - INSANE

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing you to voice my opposition to your proposed tax on cigarettes. I am shocked that the Governor of North Carolina would even consider such a tax. Do you realize how many jobs are at risk if this proposal succeeds? Do you realize that the tax revenue will ulitmately decrease if your proposal succeeds? I am flabbergasted!! I do have a suggestion for you that will help. The tax woes will not be fixed by taxing cigarettes. Do you also realize that most of the smokers in the county are unemployed or considered below the middle class? If you really want to implement a tax on ALL the residents of North Carolina and not just a select few, then suggest a tax on Fast Food, Junk Food, Sodas, and all related ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù foods. There is an endless supply of income if you add a small tax to these items and not an additional taxation on cigarettes. I do support your taxation on alcohol but please find an alternative for the cigarette tax. Thank you. Dr. Nordskog

Comment: I don't understand why Gov. Perdue wishes to further damage the jobs in NC. The FET will hurt tremendously and this will only increase the unemployment rate. Has anyone figured what the state will really gain after decreased cigarette volumes, decreased MSA payments, and lost jobs. Tobacco industry workers can't pay income taxes if they are not working. Although this is a controversial industry, it has provided great things for the state of NC. Sincerely, Mark Garner

Subject: Tax increase on cigarettes and other tobacco products.

Comment: I would just like to give my opinion on the proposed tax increase on tobacco products. As governor of the state of NC you are suppose to look out for the states best interest, and I do not believe if you push this bill through that you are doing what you took oath to do. If you push this increase you will be potentially costing our state 50,000 jobs. You won't be punishing those who smoke but everyone in the state because if that many people are out of work then they won't be purchasing other normal comodities either. Do you really want to go down in the history books as the one who caused NC unemployment rates to hit the double digits. Why is it that everyone in politics likes to attack the tobacco industry. Why not go after all of the alcohol companies. How long has it been since someone hit their taxes. It really saddens me that you were voted into office as our Governor knowing that these are the steps that you plan to take to "improve" our state.

Comment: Hon. Governor Perdue, I strongly oppose your proposed tobacco tax. Over 50,000 North Carolinians work growing, manufacturing, supplying, and selling tobacco products in NC. This tax will cause the loss of 1000's of these jobs. It is a fact. You should be trying to create jobs not eliminate jobs. Thank you, Michael Hudspeth

Why do you Libs keep harping on tobacco? The truth is that you are interested on controlling people's lives and pushing the Lib agenda. Stop harassing us.

Subject: Proposed tax increase on tobacco products

Comment: How can the governor possibly consider proposing additional tax increases on tobacco products? We've just seen the largest federal excise tax increase on tobacco in history and now we're proposing increasing the state excise tax? We've seen unemployment rates growing by leaps and bounds recently across the nation. Reynolds America is still a major employer in Winston Salem. Additional tax increases on these products continue to drive this business into further staff reductions, not to mention increasingly placing a disproportionate financial burden on people who choose to continue to use these products. I realize that taxes are a necessary evil. It takes money to run our government, educate our children, keep our roads maintained, etc. However, there should be a way to obtain funding for these initiatives without constantly going after one industry and one consumer group. It unfairly targets jobs related to that industry and the consumers who choose to use that product. As an employee of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a consumer of cigarettes and a registered voter in North Carolina, I‚Äôm really struggling with how this is going to help our over-all economy. My husband who is also a smoker, but not employed within this industry called me yesterday after prices increased based on the pending federal excise tax increase to ask what was up with the price of cigarettes. I explained that the price increase was not a manufacturers‚Äô increase but that prices were increasing due to federal taxes increasing. He responded by telling me that it was time for him to quit. While that‚Äôs not a bad thing for him to do; if enough people respond in that manner, how does this help North Carolina‚Äôs bottom line? It puts people out of work that are currently working within the tobacco industry, causes people who do still choose to use the product to pay additional monies for it and the government still doesn‚Äôt increase revenue‚Ä¶ People, all of our country, are struggling to pay their bills and put food on the table. To place additional expenses on a particular consumer segment and place additional jobs in jeopardy is just unreasonable.

Comment: It infuriates me that government can pick on one industry to solve all the budget deficits. First, the tobacco industry has to provide health care to all the children in the US...despite the fact that other industries are causing health problems to these same children (can you say obesity). But call on the cash cow industry to provide. Now, our own newly elected Governor is jumping on the bandwagon and proposing a $1 pack increase on cigarettes. This is outrageous! Let's raise the tax $1 on the cost of Twinkies instead! As an employee of a tobacco company, I am deeply concerned for my job and the jobs of all my coworkers. But, the good news is my kids can get medical coverage under SCHIP when we are living off the government. Fortunately, I do not smoke, so I should be able to buy a little bit of food when I am out of a job. I really feel for those that will have to choose between smokes and food. I guess I should say, I feel for the victims of that decision. Let's not make that choice any harder. Please reconsider the outrageous tax increase on cigarettes. This bad decision will seriously affect children of smokers and innocent people who would be more volnerable to theft and muggings. I would rather see the state income tax raised..at least I might still have a job to be able to pay income tax.

If a case of beer is $15, then I guess it will now be 75 cents more expensive. Not enough to deter anyone and not enough to make the over half of North Carolinians that drink mad. 75% of all high school students have tried alcohol but that is a problem we like to ignore. Go for the easy win. The 15% of folks that smoke. It is a tried and true method. No originality but being creative in politics gets you not voted in next go round, right?

Comment: I streneously oppose this proposed tax on cigarettes. The huge federal tax increase, which goes into effect April 1st, will be a severe blow to the tobacco industry. The tobacco industry provides over 50,000 Jobs and pays decent wages and provides very good benefits. The industry pays a tremendous amount of taxes already. Your proposal could drive the industry out of business or offshore. What will you do when there are no tobacco taxes because the industry ceases to exist? How will you balance your budget then? We will loose jobs because of the federal tax increase, the estimate is more than 3000. I know that Washington doesn't care about North Carolina, but I voted for you! I expect much better from your administration. I know that smoking is politically incorrect, but the economics are not. This is an outrageous attack on jobs in our state.

Comment: Honorable Governor Perdue, The heading above states "The Office of the Governor is here to help". We, the tax paying hard working people of this great state are pleading for help! We've lost enough jobs, period! Please reconsider the unnecessary and very detrimental idea of further taxing cigarettes in the tobacco capitol of the world. The State of North Carolina will see job losses from the federal tax increase of .62 a pack on cigarettes. Do we need to add insult to injury by adding to those numbers? Hundreds in the tobacco industry have already lost there jobs here in Winston-Salem in the past 6 months as a result of the economy. This state cannot afford to continue having jobs lost. We need to work together to add, not lose jobs. Thanks in advance for your consideration.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing to voice my protest toward your proposed outrageous tax increase of 385%† on a single pack of cigarettes in our great state of North Carolina.†

I† proudly voted for you and supported you in your recent campaign for Governor. As a life long resident of our state and retired tobacco factory worker in Cabarrus county, (forced into early retirement due to our plant's planned closing...another 2500 NC jobs down the drain), I am depending on my pension money (funded by Altria) to support my wife and myself in our retirement years.† If my pension money is gone due to a possible forced bankruptcy by legislation such as this, I beg the question?† Will the "Old North State" be there for me?

You cannot imagine my disappointment in your proposal.† I understand that our state is facing serious financial woes and tough decisions will have to be made.† But to propose such legislation that would most likely shut down an entire industry that is so important to our state, is beyond my comprehension.† It makes no sense to me for†our state to in essence, put more citizens out of work.

Why not a propose a ten, twenty, maybe even a twenty-five percent increase?†Those modest increases would generate some needed funds†while at the same time keep†thousands of North Carolinians working and save an industry from being put out of business.

†But a 385% increase?† Please!

Respectfully Yours,

Rick S. Lott

Comment: Governor Perdue, I wanted to let you know that I vehemently oppose your proposed tax increase on cigarettes. No disrespect intended, but you do understand that with this increase in taxes, you are putting another 50,000 NC jobs in jeopardy? We've already lost most of our textile and furniture jobs. I guess tobacco is next. I hope you also realize that these taxes directly have a negative effect on the "working poor" in our state. Approximately 80% of smokers make less than $75000 per year. If your tax increase passes, it will drive the cost of a carton of cigarettes to $55. They will already be $44 on April 1 due to the new federal excise tax. It looks to me like the smart and creative folks we voted into office in Raleigh could come up with a budget and balance it without putting jobs at stake. NC is already at 9.7% unemployment. Surely you do not want to drive it into double digits. Respectfully, Jerry W. Johnson

To: The Honorable Governor Bev Purdue

PLEASE do NOT increase the Cigarette Taxes on North Carolina's citizens.

‚Äì More than 50,000 jobs in N.C. are related to tobacco production, 
manufacturing and distribution.

‚Äì Unemployment in the state is at 9.7 percent ‚Äì the highest in 25 
years.

‚Äì The federal government just imposed the highest tax on cigarettes in 
history ‚Äì that alone put jobs at risk in N.C. This increase would just 
add to the problem...and as consumption goes down, the actual revenue 
for the State could actually go DOWN !!!

Economists predict North Carolina could lose 3,000 jobs as a result of 
the federal tax increase alone ‚Äì and that‚Äôs an increase of 62 cents a 
pack, compared with the $1 a pack increase you're proposing.

Washington D.C. may not care about jobs in N.C., but we expect better 
judgment out of Raleigh.

‚Äì On April 1, the average retail price of a carton of Full Priced 
Cigarettes will be $44. If your proposal is adopted, that could be $55 
per carton.

The new FET will increase the TAXES on NC Adult Smokers over $226 per 
year!! Your proposal would add another $360 per year for a pack-a-day 
smoker! That's almost $600 per year per citizen that chooses to consume 
a totally legal product.

‚Äì That has a disproportionate negative effect on the ‚Äúworking poor‚Äù in 
our state.

Overwhelmingly, Cig
arette taxes are paid by the "working poor."

- 55% of smokers are working poor.

- One in four smokers lives below the poverty line.

- Median family income of North Carolina smokers is $33,437.

- 80% of smokers make less than $75,000.

This affects all of us...not just smokers. If the tax goes up, then so 
does unemployment, crime, smuggled (non-taxed) goods. Retailers and 
Manufacturer jobs...and all the other consumer goods they purchase will 
be at risk.

PLEASE do NOT raise the cigarette taxes for North Carolina!

If you've read this far, I am much appreciative. I would very much like 
to hear your thoughts on why you think this proposal makes sense for 
North Carolina and hope that you're open minded enough to consider 
alternatives to your opinion on this matter.

Sincerely, a concerned citizen,

Subject: Proposed Cigarette Tax Increase

Comment: I am totally opposed to this recent cigarette tax increase proposed today! What will become of the many jobs in our state that are part of the tobacco industry? More than 50,000 jobs in N.C. are related to tobacco production, manufacturing and distribution.

Subject: NO MORE TOBACCO TAXES

Comment: Governor Perdue: Please re-consider the proposed $1.00 per pack tax on cigarettes that is included in the current budget. A tax increase of this magnitude will reduce the number of cigarettes sold in NC by causing people to either quit smoking or cross state lines to buy their cigarettes. This will cost the retailers of NC business and ultimately cost NC revenue because there will be less packs sold to collect taxes on and this will result in a reduction in NC‚Äôs share of the Master Settlement Agreement between the tobacco companies and the States Attorney Generals. This tax increase will also cost North Carolina citizens (and voters) jobs as the tobacco industry and all the related businesses will all see a reduction in revenue. We elected you because we believed you would represent all of us in NC so please don‚Äôt sell out the hardworking farmers and factory workers for what is sure to be a short-term gain

Comment: I have lost my job at a tobacco company and will be leaving it on March 31, 2009. Please reconsider your proposal to increase the tobacco tax. If it goes through, then more of my co-workers and friends will be losing their jobs too.

Governor Perdue,

I want to thank you for your courageous leadership in proposing increased taxes on alcohol and tobacco.† For too long, our great state has lagged behind the nation in using such taxes to promote the health of our citizens.† Please let me know how I can support your efforts to pass this legislation.

Sincerely,

William Price, MD

Subject: Sin Tax increase

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue, Raising taxes during a recession is not the answer to close budget shortfalls. We are already heavily taxed by the state and local governments. So far you are taking the correct direction in cutting spending but there is more to cut. We do not need to spend more on education at this time. Why can't politicians understand what almost every family in the state knows. If we make less we spend less and do without. Please do not raise any taxes (sin or any other). Raising sin taxes will only force people to spend less and the state will never get the return you expect. Respectfully, Gary Brace PS I do not smoke but do enjoy wine occasionally.

Subject: State Spending/Taxing

Comment: It's time N.C. governor stopped unnecessary programs and stopped raising taxes to benefit programs. I'm a non-smoker but I've had enough of government taxing the tobacco industry. Government does not tax other products like it does tobacco. Why not tax beer/liquor? Because most politicians are big drinkers and non-smokers. We non-smokers would not be happy if governments taxed a product we liked the way they have tobacco. I love sodas. Thank you for not bringing the price of a 2-liter drink to $3. IT'S TIME TO STOP NEW TAXES. We poor citizens are being neglected by State, County and City/Town governments. All they think of it TAX, TAX, TAX. It's getting so there's little money left for food, lodging and medical care. Most people in government have money so they are not as affected as the lower income. Now is not the time to raise taxes on anything. Act or maybe we the citizens of N.C. need to replace everyone in our governing bodies next election.

Subject: No to the tobacco tax increase

Comment: This is a very bad idea on top of the recent FET increase, it will cost more jobs in our state. ‚Ä¢ More than 50,000 jobs in N.C. are related to tobacco production, manufacturing and distribution. o and that‚Äôs not counting all of the other jobs and businesses affected when tobacco-related jobs are cut (e.g., unemployed workers buy less of everything else ‚Äì from milk and bread to cars and houses). ‚Ä¢ Unemployment in the state is at 9.7 percent ‚Äì the highest in 25 years. Apparently the Governor wants to drive that into double digits. ‚Ä¢ The federal government just imposed the highest tax on cigarettes in history ‚Äì that alone put jobs at risk in N.C. And now the Governor is adding to the problem. o Economists predict North Carolina could lose 3,000 jobs as a result of the federal tax increase alone ‚Äì and that‚Äôs an increase of 62 cents a pack, compared with the $1 a pack increase the Governor wants. o Washington D.C. may not care about jobs in N.C., but we expect better judgment out of Raleigh. ‚Ä¢ On April 1, the average retail price of a carton of Camels will be $44. If Gov. Perdue has her way, that could be $55 by July 1st. ‚Ä¢ That has a disproportionate negative effect on the ‚Äúworking poor‚Äù in our state. o Cigarette taxes are paid by the "working poor." ÔÇß 55% of smokers are working poor. ÔÇß One in four smokers lives below the poverty line. ÔÇß Median family income of North Carolina smokers is $33,437. ÔÇß 80% of smokers make less than $75,000.

Subject: Proposed budget

Comment: Gov. Perdue, as a recent college graduate, I have to tell you that I am highly disappointed with your proposed budget. This state especially the city of Winston-Salem, was built on tobacco and although I understand we need more money in education, I think it is a VERY bad idea to criple tobacco an industry were more than 50,000 North Carolianians are employed. I also think it is a very bad idea to cut money to universities because in this day and age we need as many high quality professionals as possible. In November, I voted for you but now I think this may have been a bad idea. If this budget is passed it will cost thousands of high paying jobs in an industry that has helped shape North Carolina. Please remember this.

Subject: Cigarette Tax Increase

Comment: I strongly oppose raising the taxes on Cigarettes. Alternate suggestion, tax fast food. A much larger source of income and might help the citizens of this state. Have you gone to a Mall and seen the number of over-weight people? I am a Democrate and voted for you. And oppose using cigarettes as a source of funding the budget. Been there done that. Try something that sends a message that you are serious about improving the health of NC. Tax the fat we eat.

Subject: taxes on cigarettes

Comment: Ms. Perdue, on the news today i saw were you are considering raising taxes on cigarettes. I would like you to know that my father worked at american tabbaco for thirty-five years,thats how he put food on our table. if you raise the tax for cigarettes another dollar more than what obama is already raising it you will be putting thousands of jobs in jeopardy. The why the economy is now i don't think risking more jobs is a good idea. please wait until more jobs come along and this country gets back on its feet. Thank you, Sally
