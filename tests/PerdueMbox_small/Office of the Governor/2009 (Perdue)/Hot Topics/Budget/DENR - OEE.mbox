Subject: Office of Environmental Education

Comment: I was appalled this evening to hear that the NC Office of Environmental Education is slated for non-existence in your budget proposal. North Carolina has been a leader in the environmental education field. Don't throw it all away. As a life-long citizen of this state, I am disheartened to hear that this wonderful program that has meant so much to me as I have made my way in the environmental education field won't be a resource any longer. As an expectant mother, I would greatly miss all that the OEE has done that would benefit me as a mother, raising my children to be responsible citizens. I'm sorry this is perhaps not the best articulated note, but I am so upset that I'm having a hard time making more sense. Please reconsider. The Office of Environmental Education is a valuable resource not just to those in the environmental education field, but science educators, and all the men, women, and children in this state who will make a difference as to what kind of North Carolina we will live in.

Subject: Office of Environmental Education - Elimination!

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, Please reconsider your proposal in the budget to eliminate the DEHNR Office of Environmental Education. As a environmental researcher, community advocate, and resident of Cary, I feel that this plan will significantly harm the effort to educate citizens of North Carolina about issues vital to preserving the environment and to preserve our children's health and future. The NC-EE listserve is one of the best resources for finding out about best practices and training opportunities for environmental educators. Please preserve the entire DEHNR Office of Environmental Education, the work that they do in outreach and education is multiplied (if you teach a person to fish, then they can feed themselves). If you teach others how to care for the environment, then we will begin to lead sustainable lives. This budget cut goes against everything that we have worked for to get you and Obama elected. We need more investment in NCDEHNR's Office of Environmental education, allowing them to help foster greater connectivity between environmental resources within our state, and to help disseminate environmental education to neighborhoods and communities across the state!

Subject: Office of Environmental Education

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I read today that to help balance the state budget, you have proposed eliminating the Office of Environmental Education to save $377,000. I would like to ask you to reconsider that budget change. The Office of Environmental Education is a model across the country. Our state is one of the cleanest, healthiest in terms of the environment and aesthetically pleasing because of this department. Educators across this state, including myself, have benefited from the lesson plans, supplies and support material produced and provided through this department. I teach earth and environmental science to students that for the most part, have not spent any time outside. They are ignorant of the wonderful diversity of life around us. I am a Certified Environmental Educator. This office has set up this program to help formal and non-formal educators achieve this certification. If you are not aware, the certification requires taking classes through national and local organizations, self directed learning, teaching what we have learned and a service project. Currently, I am a full time high school science teacher. Many of the skills, lesson plans and tools I use for my classes were the result of the Office of Environmental Education. I would not have the inquiry bases, hands on activities and lessons to help these students without the Office of Environmental Education. Dismantling the office and moving it to the various entities per your budget is a mistake. Environmental Education will not receive the detailed attention and the development of vital activities and lesson plans will not happen. I am asking respectfully to reconsider this budget proposal. As a 20+ year informal educator, 3+ year formal educator, Certified Environmental Educator, William T. Hornaday Award recipient, Order of Long Leaf Pine and concerned citizen of North Carolina, I ask you to find the budget cut in another area. Thank you.

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: I wish I could address you in more positive terms because I believe that you are the right person to lead North Carolina during these difficult times and I would rather relate my support to your administration than directing a criticism. Unfortunately I am very discouraged by your recommendation to eliminate the Office of Environmental Education in the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The work being done by this office is instrumental in providing information to North Carolinians about the impact of everyday actions on the environment. It does this through curriculum development for schools, certification of environmental education teachers and through outreach to the general population, providing us with science-based information that we can use to make good decisions regarding the environment. The office was created to meet statutory requirements. I believe that these requirements cannot be met by eliminating the six positions proposed in your budget. Transfering the functions to other areas will cause a grave disruption in the services being provided and jeopordize the valuable progress being made in protecting our natural resources. I ask that you please restore funding for the Office of Environmental Education of DENR in your proposed budget. Sincerely, Pablo Escobar Board of Directors of the Environmental Education Fund Board of Directors of El Pueblo, Inc. Board of Directors of Wake County Human Services and Environmental Services

Comment: I am proud of the hard work I've committed to the North Carolina Environmental Education Certification program and am deeply saddened that the Office of Environmental Education is on the list to be eliminated through the new proposed budget. I urge you to reconsider this elimination because this program is vital to the success of environmental educators across the state! I use the NC-EE listserv and calendar of events on a daily basis to exchange information and advertise programs at the Outer Banks Center for Wildlife Education. Because our Center is located in a desolate area of the Outer Banks, we rely on the Office of Environmental Education to get the word out about who we are and what we have to offer the general public. All of our classes are free of charge, however, we cannot reach our optimum level of effectiveness unless people know we are here. Please reconsider eliminating the Office of Environmental Education. The children of North Carolina will thank you!

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue, I am writing to express my dismay and shock at the proposed elimination of the Office Of Environmental Education in your proposed budget. North Carolina‚Äôs future depends on its children and their commitment and ability to care for and protect our natural resources. The Office of Environmental Education is crucial to that mission. It supports activities across the state that further the necessary goals of creating generations of people who have the intellectual tools and the knowledge to address the environmental challenges of today and tomorrow, and who also have an attitude that respects and cherishes our great natural heritage. I believe that to eliminate this office would be an enormous step backward for North Carolina, and it would be very difficult to consider our state to be a leader on issues of education or of the environment. We would not be operating with a 21st century mindset. I urge you, as an educator, a parent, and a citizen of this beautiful, rich state, to reconsider this portion of the budget. Thank you, Jill Anderson

Subject: Elimination of the Office of Environmental Education

Comment: I was dismayed to learn that you have proposed eliminating the Office of Environmental Education. Last week, I enrolled in the environmental education certification program. I planned to go through the program to strengthen my capabilities as a school volunteer. I have been volunteering with Asheboro City Schools for over 8 years. I chose to enter the environmental education certification program because of the strength of the training modules and because it is open to informal educators as teachers. I attended my first 6 hour program on Monday, and came home with over a hundred activities that are tied to the NC curriculum. I was in a mixed group of public school teachers, science museum employees, and someone from the park service. Everyone enjoyed the training, and we traded ideas and concerns from our own experiences. I was especially excited about the hands-on, interactive activities for grade levels from pre-K through 12. The next day, I contacted a fifth grade teacher who I have worked with before, and made plans to lead an activity for her class. Her students will benefit from this program with no cost to the school system and no lost instructional time for this fifth-grade teacher. It will be the first of many free service hours that I will be putting in to bring environmental awareness to the children of our community. I was also looking forward to visiting the environmental education centers across the state as part of my training. I was shocked to find out this morning that the entire environmental education program may be eliminated. There are unseen benefits to this program that far outweigh its cost, and I implore you to save it. Sincerely, Susan Scott

Comment: I am outraged today to learn of Governor Perdue's recommendation to close the State's acclaimed Office of Environmental Education, and cut 6 jobs, all for saving $377,000. That same amount could be cut by simply not building 1/3 of a mile of an interstate lane. Same ole' NC politics; when in need cut education. In a time of awareness of the need for green job development, I find it irresponsible of the Governor to propose shutting down the office that ensures quality environmental literacy is being developed in NC to meet the needs of the green job sector. Crisis or no crisis, this is a department to increase staff and services not close! I voted for Governor Purdue because I believed she understands the need to govern with an eye on the long-term. Her actions on this matter do not match her stated governing beliefs. I beg the Governor to pull this recommendation. Stan Cross

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I had the pleasure of living in North Carolina from August 2006 through May 2008 while I was attending Duke University. During that time, I enrolled in the North Carolina Environmental Education Certification program through the state's Office of Environmental Education and took many workshops sponsored by the Office which have proven invaluable to me as an environmental educator. The NC Office of Environmental Education is a great resource for all educators and students throughout the state of North Carolina, and is an examplary office for other states. When I moved to Nevada last summer, I was shocked that there wasn't (and still isn't) a state office of environmental education - North Carolina had set the bar high! Please do not cut funding to this crucial office. It serves the needs of many throughout the state and its services are certainly worth the price. Thank you for your time, and I hope you continue to fund the NC Office of Environmental Education. Sincerely Laura Kelm

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue, As a citizen, parent, and lifelong environmental educator I am deeply concerned about the proposed elimination of the Office of Environmental Education. I was there to see you speak at the dedication of the NC Biotech Center in Kannapolis. I was inspired by the vision that you shared for leading North Carolina in Science Technology Engineering and Math Education. I am also recently struck by three key global vectors which have converged to indicate the time is now for North Carolina to lead in fostering a deeper understanding of the natural world around us: ‚Ä¢ Scientists and many world leaders have acknowledged that the evidence of global climate change is so compelling that public policy must be re-shaped immediately to avert a planet-wide crisis. ‚Ä¢ American students need a strong foundation in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) to work and live in the 21st Century. However, as jobs requiring solid STEM backgrounds are growing, more American students are choosing not to major in these areas. By 2010, if current trends continue, the majority of the world‚Äôs scientists and engineers will not be living in the United States. The result will be a reduction in America‚Äôs global leadership in STEM industries. ‚Ä¢ Recent world economic crises have underscored for many industries, corporations and individuals that we must reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and adopt more innovative, ‚Äúgreen‚Äù policies to survive and thrive in the 21st century. Knowledge of science and technology alone cannot solve our problems or help us preserve the world. We must remember that Nature, indeed environmental education is the source of infinite wonder to which all humans return and to which we are all profoundly linked. Without a deliberate effort toward environmental education how will these vectors be addressed by our future work force? The Office of Environmental Education is absolutely necessary if we are serious about maintaining our economic and environmental well being. Yours in education, Dr. Robert Corbin

My name is Matt Collogan and I'm an educator for New Hanover County in Wilmington. I am writing to voice my disgust for the elimination of the Office of Environmental Education. Of all things to cut back on, education of our natural resources should never be comprimised. Without the environment we have nothing.†Without educating†NC's young minds about the state's natural heritage, we are paving the way for for a dark future indeed. Please take this note as public opinion†against†the elimination of our wonderful Office of Environmental Education. How can you say your budget stresses education when you remove the most effective type of education this state provides? It's time to prioritize the things that are important, and environmental education is an essential part of the economy, culture, and future of this great state. Please continue to fund the Office of Environmental Education.

Comment: I have just heard that the Environmental Education program is losing funding as well as is transferring to other facilities.I am very upset.I am presently enrolled in the program.I have always receieved immediate responses from Libby Wilcox.I feel this needs to be looked at closely.The environment should be one of the highest priorities..The persons completing the courses are advocates into the community helping educate everyone regarding the importance of sound environmental actions and things we all can do to help improve NC environment.We also are one of the states who has such a large program.This is a request not to eliminate positions,not to transfer to other entitiies and for the program to continue as it is as well as be funded. Thanks,Linda Davis R.N.

Subject: Office of Environmental Education

Comment: Ms. Purdue, I am alarmed and upset that your proposed budget eliminates the office of environmental education. As a former educator, I am sure you know the value of educating children, our future. Furthermore, as we transition to a greener economy and combat global climate change, environmental awareness is more important than ever. I know that our state faces a fiscal crisis, but I strongly believe that this should be high on the list of priorities. Please do not make the mistake of eliminating the Office of Environmental Education. Thank you, Brian Ziegler

Comment: I am incredulous at the news of the elimination of the Environmental Educators of North Carolina, EENC, from the state budget. With the current presidential administration focus and all the urgent need to address all of our environmental problems, this is not the time to remove such topics from our schools. This department must be reinstated!

Comment: We support your proposed budget. We especially agree that the DENR Office of Environmental Education should be eliminated, based upon our personal involvement in the education programs that the office sponsors or supports. We also feel you should eliminate the DENR positions that advance and monitor for what is called "global warming" and/or "climate change." DENR has at least one dedicated position that has mandated reporting of energy and fuel usage for this purpose. We feel this is a waste of our hard-earned tax dollars. Thank you for your hard work in a difficult time.

Subject: Environmental Education

Comment: Dear Madame Governor, I am very disturbed to hear of the possible loss of the environmental education program in North Carolina. Since entering the program three years ago, I have changed the way that I teach science. I offer many more opportunities for my students to discover the state they live in, and it's living history. I have also received many grants through their program, all of which benefit my classroom directly. But the most telling part of the program is how much they care for the students, our children, of the this state. When the state announced the mandatory graduation project, EENC was the first to hear the call. The organized getting mentors for students, and also provided a place for them to gather information. So, even if you don't care about the huge number of educators that are helped throughout the state, then please consider the students and the benefit to them. Thank You, Timothy Adams

Subject: Elimination of the Environmental Education program through NCDENR

Comment: Dear Gov. Bev Perdue, I received an email this morning stating that the Department of Environmental Education through NCDENR might be eliminated. This includes the well known Environmental Education Certification. Many of us including myself are in the beginning, middle or end of this VERY valuable certification program and we all have been working extremely hard to complete the requirements. There is NO good basis for elimination of this program. It has helped hundreds of informal and formal educators become more aware of the environmental factors impacting our world, and helps us to incorporate this knowledge into our education classes and daily business practices. This is extremely disheartening. President Obama speaks of focusing more on environmental issues and this program is a huge step for informal and formal educators. I will be attending a workshop Thursday and Friday called Project Wet which I am very excited about and was looking forward to adding it to my EE certification. The EE website is an extremely valuable source of information and lists everything that a person needs to know about this program. Governor Perdue, I believe that you are being misinformed about this program. The EE certification program has a positive impact that can clearly be seen, just ask those who have completed it or are in the process of completing it. I ask that you please take another look at it. I think two ways to save this program might be to increase the sign-up fee which is currently $50. In addition some of the workshops are free or have a minimal fee. I would gladly pay to attend a workshop or pay a little more to have this program continue. For all of us in the process of gaining our EE certification, please do not make our hard work and efforts amount to nothing. Please, I urge you to find a solution to keeping the Environmental Education Certification alive. I really believe that if you asked us to invest more of our money in order to keep the program alive we all would, because we believe in it that much! Thank you and I hope this email finds its way to you. God Bless! Rhonda Leonard

Comment: I was shocked and dismayed to learn that Gov. Perdure is even considering eliminating the DENR Office of Environmental Education. Is she insane. This office has tremendous impact in our community and we should be expanding it, not reducing it. There is ample research that supports the positive influence on Environmental Education. Please reconsider this budget cut. It's absolutely asinine.

Comment: I am shocked to learn elliminating the DENR Office of Environmental Education is being considered. As an environmental educator, one of the reasons I recently moved back to NC was because of its fabulous Environmental Education Certification program and multitudes of professional development opportunities. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Science Education at NCSU as well as working on my Environmental Education Certification. I know tough decisions are having to be made because of budget cuts, but is cutting out an entire educational department moving NC in the right direction?

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue, I have been informed that the proposed budget includes cutting the Office of Environmental Education. I believe this is a TRAGEDY! As an educator who has received my Environmental Education Certification, I can speak to the worthiness of this office. The certification program, the EE Institutes, and the staff of the OEE have helped to keep me informed and enlightened on environmental issues that I must relay to my students. As to shipping the responsibilities to other departments--having worked as an aquarium educator under NCDENR and as a current community college instructor I know the staff in other departments do not have the time,resources, or knowledge to do what the staff of the OEE does on a daily basis. Thank you for your consideration, Cindy Seymour Biology Instructor Certified Environmental Educator

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, Please rethink your proposed elimination of the Office of Environmental Education. As an environmental educator, this office has been an invaluable resource both in my professional development and in my ability to educate the public about our state's environmental issues. The Office of EE has helped me to connect with other educators in my area to pool resources, provided excellent workshops that I have used at the non-profit where I work, and has served many important functions. Without the Office, I would not have been able to teach thousands of K-12 students and adults about our local waterways and how to protect them. I know that every environmental educator in the state relies on the office, and without it the quality of enviro. ed. and consequently, the knowledge of the public and the quality of our environment will quickly deteriorate. North Carolina is at a pivotal point where we need to have an environmentally educated public in order to protect our beautiful state, and this cannot happen without the Office of EE. Thank you, Kathryn Blau Environmental Educator

Subject: Budget cuts for DENR

Comment: Madam Governor, I am a member of NCAE and NEA. I have served as a local Vice President to UCAE. I am a high school teacher who teaches Earth and Environmental Science at Forest Hills High School in Marshville, North Carolina. We are a low income school in Union county and not much money comes our way. I voted for you in the elections where you ran because you were a former teacher and I felt that you had our best interest in mind. The following was email to me and others who are associated with DENR. They have provided workshops that are essential to our programs at the middle school and high school level. They give out vital information and send us information about our water systems in North Carolina. Without this work source, many of my students would not have had the opportunity to learn and understand the importance of ground water, point source and non-point source pollution. They would not be able to truly understand about our ocean shorelines and importance of them. They are the place I go to find out information. The list serve that I am part of also gives me daily input and people who care about the environment and how it should be taught. To get rid of this agency will put all of us who teach Earth Science back to square one. If you want to cut the budget, but some unnecessary offices at the state level that has nothing to do with education. Please do not cut this important agency. The entire environmental education constituency in North Carolina is shocked to learn today that Governor Perdue's proposed budget eliminates the DENR Office of Environmental Education. - to save $377,000!

The only thing that I need to hear from you is that it is not true that youi suggested doing away with the Office.

Indeed, either she is misquoted or mistaken: "Transferring the curriculum development functions..." is telling in that curriculum development has never been a function of the Office. I appreciate the support of the Governor in education. I sacrifice my longevity willingly to keep others in their positions. Please ensure that eliminating the OEE is the best plan for our state.

Subject: Restore funding for NC Office of Environmental Education

Comment: Re: Restore $377,209 in state budget for NC Office of Environmental Education An open letter to Governor Beverly Purdue Dear Governor Purdue: On November 30, 2006 you wrote a letter to me following the ceremony to honor newly certified Environmental Educators. At the time, I was President of Environmental Educators of North Carolina. You wrote, ‚ÄúOur children are our greatest resource, and ensuring they understand the importance of the environment in which they live is an essential part of a well-rounded education. Environmental educators across our state are helping to build a stronger North Carolina‚Ä¶Thank you for including me in this special program and please call on me anytime I can be of assistance to you.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt agree more, and I am calling on you for assistance. Please restore funding in the budget for the Office of Environmental Education. The work this small office does has ripple effects all across our state. Their promotion of Environmental Education Centers boosts tourism, bringing in valuable dollars to our economy. Their functions cannot simply be farmed out to other offices. The office has a professional staff trained specifically in the multi-disciplinary field of environmental education to ensure that children and adults across our state gain the knowledge and skills to make wise decisions about some of the biggest issues that face us today: energy, climate change, and a reliable supply of clean water. Perhaps most disturbing is the fact that the budget recommendation does not mention the Environmental Education Certification Program. I was certified in 1999 and have served on the Certification Advisory Committee for several years. Thousands of teachers, park rangers, nature center staff, and others rely on the certification to gain the professional skills necessary to carry out their jobs. For many, it is a job requirement. As a water resources professional, I regularly rely on the expertise and technical materials offered by the NC Office of Environmental Education. I realize we all must sacrifice during these tough times. But please, don‚Äôt destroy the momentum of more than two decades of state and national leadership provided by the Office of Environmental Education. As you say, our children and the strength of our state depend on it. Sincerely, Laura Webb Smith Life Member, Environmental Educators of North Carolina

Subject: Environmental Education

Comment: Dear Governor, Please do not withdraw the environmental education in NC. The environment is one of our critical concerns these days, especially in light of the budget crisis. We need to ensure that the environment will be looked after as we try to pull out of these tough economic times. We can even look to the environment as a source for creative ways to bring back our economy. Please keep the environmental education program going. Thank you.

Subject: Do Not Eliminate Office of Environmental Ed.

Comment: Governor Bev Perdue, In this critical time for environmental issues, it is unthinkable that our state government would consider cutting funding for the Office of Environmental Education. As an educator, I believe in the importance of teaching children to care about the environment and to seek knowledge and understanding so that as our future leaders, they can help to create solutions for our pressing problems. Without extended opportunities to experience, gain skills and acquire factual knowledge and without teachers who are confident and capable in our local environment, we are sorely neglecting a most critical part of our duty as educators. We cannot produce well rounded future decision makers, if they do not have this firsthand experience to draw from. North Carolina has been a leader in Environmental Education and the Office of EE is a special and unique entity in our state. As a teacher, I draw from the resources available through the Department of Environmental Education as well as rely on others who have received training through this program. Please consider the importance of your decision for the future of our students, teachers and for the perilous impacts our uninformed actions have on the future of our planet. Sincerely, Kevin J. Smith Governor Purdue Supporter Technology Instructor Evergreen Community Charter School Asheville, NC

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I heard of your proposed budjet cuts to the department of Environmental Education. Should this pass, it would be a tradgedy for all of the children and teachers who benefit from North Carolina's rich Environmental Education programs. As our world is faced with so many environmental crisis it is more important than ever to nurture a generation of citizens who are passionate about the natural environment. This proposed budget cut could have dire consequences on all citizens of North Carolina loss of jobs, but more importantly it could mean a loss of sense of value on North Carolina's beloved natural environment. Please consider revising this proposal. Thank you, Maria Simcox

Subject: proposed removal of Office of Environmental Education

Comment: Dear Ms. Perdue: I couldn't believe it when I read that you are considering eliminating the Office of Environmental Education. As an environmental educator, I am directly impacted by this. It was BECAUSE of this department that I have become an environmental educator. As part of the EENC list serve I have been finding out about and attending fascinating and useful workshops in environmental education, and even found my job with the Agape Center for Environmental Education through this office. When I have gone out of state, which I often do, I have boasted about NC's wonderful EE office, feeling so proud of all the amazing programs going on in our state to educate about what is the most important consideration in these times: the health of our environment. I voted for you because I believed that you valued our investments in education in this state. $377,000 is a SMALL price to pay to keep environmental education alive in our state. Without this important office, our state would not be leaders in this field any longer. For the past couple of years I have been taking every EE workshop I can, not just to get my EE certificate, but because the programs are so fantastic! I already have enough credits to get me the certificate, but I love what I am learning through the various state parks and environmental centers. Environmental Education is CRUCIAL to the health and happiness of the students in our state. Today I led two groups of first graders from a Raleigh school through our forest to learn about weather, insects, predators and prey. They were delighted to be outdoors in a stimulating learning environment. For many groups we have taught, their experience at Agape was probably their first in a natural forested area without roads, cars, and houses. Many children don't even realize what kinds of animals are native to our area, expecting to see lions and tigers (and I am not just talking about first graders!) I would never even be doing this sort of work if it hadn't been for the Office of Environmental Education. PLEASE, do not allow such a small amount of money to encourage you to delete this important office!

Subject: Please don't get rid of DENR Office of Environmental Education

Comment: Hello, My Mom is a retired educator (teacher of TAG students....YOUR future leaders) in Chapel Hill. Please don't get rid of this extremely informative and important program. Children need this, and my Mom has been doing post-retirement work teaching the young children of your great state this invaluable knowledge. The amount involved ($377,000) is a pittance as compared to what they gain in knowing how much they and future generations have to do with the environment and how people can change and help the natural world we live in. Please keep this program active, and PLEASE READ WHAT MY MOTHER HAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS: "Friends, this Office is what has given me life after retirement! I have taken many workshops in environmental education, and even got two of my jobs through the EENC listserve. If it weren't for this department, I wouldn't be working at Agape Center for Environmental Education or Camp Chestnut Ridge, providing children with great hands-on science experiences in the outdoors. I have written to our governor and representatives, as suggested below. Please be moved to do the same. Many people will be in bad shape as a consequence of this act, not to mention the children who need all the environmental education they can get!" Thank you in advance for your understanding and for your clarity in seeing just how important this is, and how it can affect so many lives. Respectfully yours, Zach Solem Atlanta, GA

Subject: Environmental Funding

Comment: The State of NC has done a good job of underfunding our environmental and natural resource programs. For example, state efforts to ensure our rivers and streams are clean is largely a joke. Now your administration seems intent on using the economic downturn to make these matters even worse. Because the national economic meltdown will be long-term and will be followed by a far worse climate & related environmental meltdown ... now is the time to decide whether we will become another Hati or whether we will tighten our belts in a rational way and go all out to minimize the catastrophic climate/environmental meltdown headed our way ... the first phase of which already is here. With Best Regards S. Keisler

Governor Purdue,
Dismantling the office of Environmental Education is very unwise. †This is an up and coming economic field in the United States. †In our little charter high school we have begun 4 environmental micro enterprises, 2 of those with assistance from this office. †Four of our teachers have been to the wonderful summer professional development sessions they host, and are in the middle of acquiring EE certification.
It is not very much money.
Please rethink your choice.

Dear Governor Perdue,
I am deeply saddened to hear of your proposal to eliminate the Office of Environmental Education. I have counted myself lucky to live in a state that prioritizes environmental education as much as NC does in having a state office.† The EE Office's Environmental Education certification program is a fantastic resource for classroom teachers as well as for the non-profit I work for.† Through the program, I have enriched my own knowledge and teaching base enormously, and been provided with innumerable valuable resources which I have been able to share with other instructors who teach with Muddy Sneakers: The Joy of Learning Outside.†The 13 of us who work with classroom teachers through the†Muddy†Sneakers program†are only a drop in the†bucket of the hundreds of other formal and informal educators in this state who are making positive changes in the awareness and actions of our citizens by educating themselves on environmental issues.
North Carolina is only one of a few states with an Environmental Education program -- what a sign of our progressive view on bringing about positive student growth, with an eye on future generations! The EE Office has been instrumental in making clear connections between outdoor learning and academic, social, and psychological developments in children. In addition to the long-term human and economic benefits of a well-rounded citizenry, environmental education makes sense if we want to preserve and protect NC's valuable natural resources. If young people don't learn about nature, they see no need to protect it. For these reasons, I think that it would be a serious mistake to eliminate the Office of Environmental Education.

Please consider carefully†how you really want to support education in North Carolina. Environmental Education is a crucial part.† I believe it would be a short-sighted mistake to†cut the state budget in this manner.
Thank you for your†consideration,
Lauren Agrella

This is a sincere request to continue the North Carolina Office of Environmental Education.



As our collective attention turns more closely to sustainability in support of President Obamaís directives as well as the stimulus package intentions, we must support and expand educational programs to our children that directly connect them to their natural world. Our efforts today will not be sustained if our children are not connected to the environment at an early age. Consider the important message in Richard Louvís <http://richardlouv.com/>ìLast Child in the Woodsî.† The <http://www.eenorthcarolina.org/>NCOEE is a tremendous resource not only for k-12 education, but continues into the <http://www.eenorthcarolina.org/colleges.htm>higher learning institutions such as Central Piedmont Community College. It also has great value for families looking for information and sources of education and events all across North Carolina.



Governor Perdue, have you visited the website yourself? My feeling is that someone made this recommendation and that you may not be aware of all this organization has to offer our state. Please take five minutes at least, and look over the website and the incredible materials and resources that they provide to all of us. This cannot be lost. I would rather have my taxes increased to pay for environmental education such as this organization provides than to see if go away. Education is key to sustainability!† You cannot have one without the other. Educators, museums, nature centers, environmental organizations, county park & recreation departments and many many other institutions use this resource on a weekly basis and will be adversely affected if this program is lost.



Please, reconsider this decision. Funding is minor when you consider the impact. Go to the website and see for yourself† Do some homework and be informed on this very worthwhile resource. Give me a call if you want to hear more reasons.



Thank you for reading my email and for helping to keep our children educated on important issues regarding our natural world.



Best regards,

Ernie
