Subject: [Aid4Mail Trial tag #16887] Funding Cuts for Shipboard Operations at Cape Fear Community College,
 Marine Tech Program

Dear Governor Perdue,

†I am writing today to ask you to please help in the matter of funding cuts for shipboard operations in the Marine Tech program at Cape Fear Community College† (CFCC). I discovered recently that It has been decided that funding for the operation of the research vessel RV Dan Moore be eliminated effective fiscal year 2009-2010. This action would serve to cripple one of the premier Marine Technology programs in the country at a time when many, including myself, are re-training themselves to meet anticipated workplace needs.

My own personal story is not all that uncommon these days. I feared that my computer related job would eventually be outsourced or eliminated† - my company was bought out 7 times over 11 years and the only people who profited were Wall Street. At 52 years of age, I decided to take the risk of retraining myself for a new career. The excellent Marine Tech program at CFCC offered me a viable alternative. Part of what makes this program so unique and valuable is the hands on shipboard experience we gain on our voyages - something that can't be obtained at any other institution on the East coast. I have found the shipboard experience to be immeasurably valuable, as do potential employers. With the current state of the economy I strongly feel that now is not the time to cut funding for programs dedicated to retooling the workforce.† I am hoping that this† decision can be forestalled. I would greatly appreciate your consideration in this matter.

Sincerely,

Tom Pawlicki

Dear Governor Purdue,

I have written our State representative about this issue before and received no response.

The State maintains ABC stores all over the state.† These stores, or at least the two in Henderson County, probably have four to six employees each.† Almost every time I go into an ABC store, there are as many employees as customers.† Prices are high so many people who are within 50 miles of South Carolina, Tennessee or Virginia make a periodic trip to those states to stock up on liquor.† Certainly, I know this is true of residents near South Carolina.

I assume the ABC store employees are State employees who receive all of the State benefits, healthcare, pensions, etc.† Assuming this is true, I am wondering if the profit from ABC stores pays for all of these benefits, particularly health care and pensions.† If they don't, the laws should be changed and State ABC stores should be eliminated.† Iowa had a State ABC store system some years ago.† They changed the system such that retail liquor stores are privately run.† I believe the State still supplies the retail stores from State warehouses, but I am not sure of that.† At least Iowa does not have the burden of future pensions and health care for the retail store employees.

The bottom line is, I do not believe North Carolina should be in the liquor business, a business that is more efficiently and probably more economically, handled by private business.

Best regards,

Ron Davis

   Good Afternoon Governor Perdue,
      I know it's budget time. We're all feeling the pressure. My name
is Tammy Thompson and I work for Davidson County Schools. I'm feeling
the pressure as well, being a teacher assistant. I'm aware of the
possible budget cutbacks, but please be aware of how vital our role
is within the schools before deciding to cutback the teacher
assistant positions. I would like to mention a few of our
responsibilities that you may not be aware of. The clerical portion
of our positions have all but been eliminated. We are now instructing
the children in the classroom, one-on-one instructional time with
students, small group settings, remediation, we cover classrooms to
provide the necessary planning time and duty free lunches for the
teachers, drive the buses, and monitor students at arrival and
dismissal as part of our duties. It may seem to be the quick solution
for the budget, but I feel it will only hurt the success of our NC
children. Please take a minute and visit our NCATA website to view
our thoughts and concerns. I recently sent you a letter as well, I'm
hoping that you will receive at least one of my letters.
           Thank You,  Tammy Thompson

FYI ñ A Suggestion

I would like to suggest the interesting California model to reduce personnel cost till the budget can be balanced.



California state government according to its Governor, will place workers on a paid 4 day work week. The 5th day is unpaid and no work.†



This is being done for a period of six months till the budget can be balanced.



This idea saves the jobs of State workers.

I think this idea should be considered, till the budget can be balanced.

Subject: State Health Plan Update





State Health Plan Update!

RIF and Health Coverage

†Employees who lose their job as a result of a reduction in force (RIF) will continue to have coverage under the State Health Plan for up to twelve months, as long as the employee has twelve or more months of service and the employee was covered by the State Health Plan at the time of separation from service.†
†Employees may continue coverage for their eligible dependents during this 12-month period.† The employee and any dependents will remain on the employing unit's billing statement while receiving RIF benefits.† The employing unit is responsible for collecting and remitting any applicable premiums.††The State Health Plan will allow employees who have been RIFíd to change their health plan coverage (move from 80/20 to 70/30) and coverage type (employee-family to employee only), as long as the request is made within 30 days from the date of separation from service.† <http://www.shpnc.org/hbr-updates/february-2009/change-form-example.pdf>Click here for an example of the Change Form correctly completed. ††Employees who elect not to continue coverage under RIF immediately following separation may not obtain coverage at a later date.† After one year, the former employees and their eligible dependents may continue health coverage on a fully contributory basis. Former employees who choose to continue their coverage after their initial 12 months will be directly billed by Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina. ††Employees who do not have 12 months of consecutive service may continue health care coverage at full cost under COBRA (for themselves and any eligible dependents).

GREAT NEWS!† NC HealthSmart programs and interventions are working!† Members are better managing their chronic conditions.† As a result, Plan savings totaled $18 million in 2007.† This means that for every $1 spent on the Health Coaching program, $2 are saved.† Next, the State Health Plan will focus on wellness efforts to prevent chronic disease.† These results and next steps are outlined in <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1102467397801&e=001_-QgL7pf_rI2wU83J1Sh1-ERXzV1rJQ0iZSAWnacQ01cDm7rvGq80V9AaiyggBkcINZHpwA94NjAuWrdu6qEyMtgcnFAWWC9wemJ3dJZTbZkiEmYu1v1Gc52jIaqGkmyc77uVqus9YY-3UNAcw76hKfdibgj4pbI>The State of Member Health: Trends and Interventions for Plan Members 2008.†


New Prescription Refill Guidelines

The State Health Plan for Teachers and State Employees will be following new guidelines for prescription refills beginning on March 2, 2009. The new prescription refill guidelines are being implemented to comply with pharmacy "best practice" standards and regulatory requirements. Most members will not notice a change when they order a prescription refill.† †The updated prescription refill guidelines will be used to review member prescription history to calculate when a medication is eligible for refill. <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1102467397801&e=001_-QgL7pf_rKdm6sn4YdXiXawXCHtq-Dx_7lXeCKX6XDUx3jKc9tD-HfWWrFvQwGn8etglPLg7RwXPkph90kUeP1GpgIYfE24KBydrK0H_ZIf7UOt3TdnFN0KlxcIIN6oWByJMSs33f8=>Click here to read more.







Reminder to Verify Pay Statements after Health Plan Changes

Employees should review monthly pay statements after a coverage type change (changing from employee-family coverage to employee-only coverage), which results in a change in the payroll deduction.† This is a way for you to verify that the requested coverage change was made.

Subject: state budget option

Comment: State Budget option I have lived in Iowa for 36 of my 41 years. Grew up in Cedar Falls with my father being employed by John Deere and my mother was a nurse. I am a veteran of the US Navy, received the GI bill and went to college at Iowa State. I had to balance 3 parttime jobs while going to school fulltime but did not graduate. In 1998 I moved back to the cedar valley. I cannot remember all the jobs I had from 1998 to present. My employer now is the University of Northern Iowa as a boiler operator at the powerplant and have been there for 2 years now. Now that you know a little bit about me, let me tell you a little about Iowa. The state of Iowa employs 48,000 people. As in the case of most of the states , we are suffering from severe budget restrictions. When a state reduces its budget it looks for cuts in personnel, goods, and services. All of this can be translated into reduction in orders in factories which in turn causes the factories producing these goods and services to cut their budgets and layoff personel. These cuts feed themselves and cause more cuts and more cuts‚Ä¶etc. This is what is going on right now. The idea I have come up with will put $270 million into the average states budget to be used for the purchase of goods and services as well as taking people off of layoffs. All of this will be done without raising any taxes. All that would need to be done is taking a tax that is paid for by everyone and giving it to the states. If you remember last year when the price of gas was so high, Senator Mccain called for the suspension of the 18.4 cents/gallon gas and 24.4 cents/gallon diesel federal taxes from memorial day to labor day ( approx 4 months). He called this an ‚Äú immediate economic stimulus‚Äù. Shortly after that the ARTBA ( Ameriican Road and Transportation Builders Association) did a study on the drastic effects that this would cause. You can view this study by going to the ARTBA website or doing a websearch using the words ‚Äú top ten‚Äù and ‚Äúfederal gas tax‚Äù . The very first reason it states is about the $9 billion lost during that 4 month period. This means, using my vast algebraic skills, that in 6 months $13.5 billion would be generated from the tax. Doing some more math you would find that the average state contributes $270 million during that 6 month period. So, if we could make it so that the money generated went back to the state to be used for their budget to buy goods and services and bring back personel that were layed off, then maybe we could start to turn around the economy. Now, I know you are wondering about the general highway fund where the $13.5 billion originally went. This study was done back in April/May of 2008. One thing that has happened since this study has been out was the $700 billion stimulus package which gave the DOT $13.5 billion as well as the highway fund received $53.7 billion. Also, in the Omnibus 2009 bill just passed the DOT received $50 billion. Also,the 2010 budget is asking for a 2.5% budget increase from the 2009 budget. I know they need the money for increased transportation projects and personel increases but they should at least give this a look at. If you agree with this proposal please forward it to your congress representative. I am very interested in your views over this matter and would encourage any feedback you may have.

Subject: Budget cut proposals

Comment: Ms. Perdue, I am employed as a teacher assistant with Pamlico County Schools. The recent budget cut proposals are an outrage and a slap in the face to the educators of the state of North Carolina. These are the very educators who voted for you and helped to put you in office. I always thought of you as "Bev" and our friend but that opinion is changing in light of a lot of your recent "ideas". Freezing our longevity, ABC money, creating a $265,000 job for your friend Mr. Harrison are just a few important ones. If our budget is in so much trouble then why do you think we have the money to create a new position that has such an outrageous salary? It seems like that money could have been used instead of touching money that affects thousands of state employees! Our economy is already suffering. At an all time high are foreclosures, bankruptcies, unemployment, and decreased spending. People cannot pay their bills as it is and yet you want to take money OUT of our salaries that we already count on to pay the bills we have. What an adverse affect this would have on the economy. The cost of living is rising at a rapid rate and you want to give teachers an increase of only 2% and the rest of the state's employees get NOTHING!!! You think things are bad now. Just wait until so many of us are making even less under your proposals. I am sure you are familiar with the trickle-down affect. I am a single mother and a dedicated educator. I have 25 years as a teacher assistant with Fred A. Anderson Elementary. I don't think you realize how small my yearly salary is and how tight my budget is. Could you live on $23,000 a year? That is what I make after 25 years of dedicated service. I can't manage on that and I know you would not be able to do so either. My longevity and ABC money along with my tax refund and child support are all that keep me afloat at this time of the year. Take that away from me and I will not be able to pay either my rent, light bill, car payment, car insurance, water bill, etc. I do not have cable tv or trash pick up just to try to save money where ever I can. I work very hard and I am very dedicated to the children that I work with everyday. I have always tried to go above and beyond and my colleagues certainly do the same. We are some of the lowest paid professionals and paraprofessionals in the state. So, please tell me why you are trying to take money away from us that we earn, need and deserve?????????? I'm sure Mr. Harrison would NEVER agree to do our jobs for the salaries that we are paid. So, once again I ask you how you can do this to educators with a clear conscience???? Please be willing to use other avenues to balance the budget instead of taking away part of our salaries that we are entitled to and have worked very hard to earn. This should not even be legal. To TAKE someone's salary away who makes less than $50,000 a year and create a job for someone and pay them $265,000 a year. You should be willing to treat us like the professionals that we are and always will be. Sincerely, Rosemary Fulford Study Island Administrator Fred A. Anderson Elementary
