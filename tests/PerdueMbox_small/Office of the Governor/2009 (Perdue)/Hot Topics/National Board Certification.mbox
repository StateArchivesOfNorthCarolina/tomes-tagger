Comment: Ms. Perdue, Thank you for continuing to support educators with the national board process. I certified as a nationally board certified teacher this year and the experience has been wonderful. I really feel the process has permitted me to reach more students and I now work at an alternative school. I would love the opportunity to speak with your more about this, and you are welcome to visit my classroom and meet my students. I think this is going to be a great term and a great time for North Carolina. I am excited about having you as our leader. Thanks again for supporting teachers and helping us reach our potential.

Comment: I wanted to send my deepest support and thanks for continuing to support the North Carolina's Nationally Board Certified teachers. I just achieved my boards this year and am eager to implement these standards into my teaching instruction. I am truly appreciative that my work will not be looked over and that NC's government will continue to support National Board candidates with a supplement.

Comment: Just wanted to thank you for your continuing support and to let you know that receiving National Board Certification has made a big difference to me and my students. I am consciously aware of what I am teaching and how I am impacting my students everyday! National Board Certified teachers make sure students know why they are learning the chosen content and reflecting on their own progress continuously.

Subject: National Board Certification Budget Cuts

Comment: Governor Perdue, As a National Board certified educator, I am extremely concerned about the information received regarding possible budget cuts to the National Board Certification program. I am also confused. Will this budget cut impact educators who have already achieved National Board certification or will it only effect the candidates who are seeking certification (the state not paying their certification fee)? The process of becoming a National Board certified educator is a rigorous one and not to be taken lightly. Therefore, if cuts must be made to the program, please consider cutting funding for certification process instead of taking away the 12% salary increase of those who have already received this prestigous certification. Sincerely, Shelly Goines-Harris

Comment: It has recently come to my attention that some states are considering dropping the NBPTS incentive pay for their teachers. As a former teacher and National Board Certified Teacher, I urge North Carolina to look for other options. Teachers have worked extremely hard for this honor and if it is taken away, I fear that teacher morale could suffer. I know many things must be considered in trying economic times, but ask that this please be taken into consideration when looking at the state budget. Thank you for all you and your staff do.

Subject: NBPTS

Comment: Mrs. Perdue- It has come to my attention that several states, not including NC, are doing away with NBCT's pay. I am wondering if this is something you are considering. If so, not only will impact me but my family. Before considering anything, I would like to let you know that many of us are living based on this additional income. It is assumed this was our salary until the certification runs out (unless renewed). As a NBCT, mother, and wife, the results would be tramatic. We could lose our home or vehicles if this was a decision or motion you would consider. I am a highly qualified teacher, and dedicated to serve the students of NC. I have worked hard to get where I am today, including raises and earning my Master's degree in May. I hope you are NOT considering doing away with our status as many of us are remarkable instructors for your state. Thanks! Melissa Neal NPCT, 2003

Comment: January 26, 2009 Dear Governor Perdue, I wish to thank you for the efforts you made as a state representative in supporting the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. North Carolina has proven her dedication to teachers by making sure teachers striving for this level of excellence were supported in many ways. Having just earned this distinction, the hard work and dedication to complete the process is still very fresh in my mind, my heart, and especially my practices as a Media Coordinator. Daily, I come into contact with 750+ children in my 5th and 6th grade school. This thought provoking process made me not only recognize my strengths but through deep reflection gave me the direction and confidence to face daily challenges so that I could become the best educator possible. I am a different parent and teacher because of the rigorous process required of NB candidates. I realize we are in tough economic times on both the state and federal levels. I wish to urge you, my governor, to keep the NBPTS strong in North Carolina by continuing to pay for the process as well as provide the three paid workdays to complete the process. Please do not succumb to budget woes like many states, rather continue to let North Carolina be the beacon of light for all educators in America. Thank you, Melissa G. Pleasants Melissa G.

I wanted to contact you to thank you for your continued support of National Boards and also tell you that National Board Certification has made a huge impact on my teaching career, and the students that I teach. Being a Nationally Board Certified teacher has helped me be more reflective and thoughtful in my teaching.

I know that some states have made budget cuts in the National Boards area and I hope that North Carolina will not even consider cutting any of the National Boards budget.

Comment: Gov. Perdue, I am writing to encourage you and other NC leaders to continue and support the National Board Certification for teachers in North Carolina. I have 16 years teaching experience and work with Title One students. I earned my NBCT in 2007. Before that I earned a Master's in Reading, all while having two children in school. I love what I do and the extra income is well worth the long nights of reading, writing, studying, etc... I continue to mentally use the standards and find myself reflecting on my teaching. Although it was very hard, I know our elite teachers of NC want to better themselves as educators therefore they are committed to becoming life long learners through NBCT. (I sound like I am writing a NB paper again). Anyway, Thumbs up for all you plan to do for the children of NC. I believe education is strengthened by having educated, confident, committed and knowledgeble teachers who are rewarded by extra income they have earned. Thanks, Amy

Comment: I wanted to thank Governor Perdue for supporting the National Board process. Without the support from my county and the state government, I would've been unable to go through the process. I have found great personal and professional satisfaction from being Nationally Board Certified. In addition, the pay raise has been instrumental in helping me to maintain the home that I purchased. I am aware that we are in tough economic times, and tough decisions have to be made regarding budget cuts. However, I hope that Governor Perdue still sees the importance of funding this program. It would be a huge blow to me financially to have this money taken back from my paycheck. I felt compelled to bring this up as a professional and a NC resident. The NBPTS process proved to be challenging, but truly helped me reflect on my professional practices. This program is a great example of our state "putting their money where their mouth is." Often programs are talked about or "highly recommended in the world of education, but rarely are they actually backed and supported to such a degree. I very much appreciate being treated as a professional, and being compensated for the hard work that I did and continue to do. Keep up the good work, Governor Perdue!

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, Congratulations on your election, and best wishes for the new year. I'm a teacher in Ocracoke, recently certified by the NBPTS. I know that you were instrumental in making NC a leader in the effort to allow all interested teachers to pursue Certification, and I want to urge you to preserve that opportunity as you face tough economic decisions. Without state funding, neither I nor the other four teachers at our school who either have achieved or are seeking certification would be able to make the commitment of time due to the financial demands of the process. (We are five out of 22, mind you.) I believe that the certification process is invaluable in providing dedicated teachers a systematic way of examining their own practices, and that it translates to better schools and better prepared students. Thank you for your efforts to give the opportunity of certification to so many master teachers. Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any other insight on this issue, or to drop by my classroom if you're in town at NCCAT, or just to come to the beach. (Really. Come on by.

Subject: National Board Pay

Comment: Gov. Perdue, Thank you for continuing to support National Board Certification. The National Board Certification process was the catalyst for regular reflections on my teaching practice which I know benefits me and my students. Please continue to support the additional pay which comes with earning National Board Certification so all of my colleagues will continue to analyze what we do for the children regularly. And so those of us who have earned the certification can continue to support our families in these hard economic times.

Subject: National Board Teachers

Comment: Governor Perdue, I have recently been certified a National Board Teacher in the State of North Carolina. I know that in these hard financial times, many areas within our state will see cutbacks. I want to thank you, however, for supporting teachers here in North Carolina with this program. Education is a truly special area where we need educated professionals who are life long learners. I believe and know you agree that we have to invest in our children. National Boards Certification is truly an honor among my profession. By even trying, it shows how dedicated a teacher is to his or her classroom, and once achieved, the lessons learned tremendously benefit our students, and eventually, our community. Through the National Boards process, I learned about myself as a teacher and about how to assess my students to adjust my teaching practices, and unlike college, had the ability to practice these lessons in my own classroom. Opportunities like National Boards help teachers learn new things about their teaching and allow them to update their current practices. This in itself is a benefit, but it is alot of work, and the finacial advantage for completing your boards is a big motivator for teachers completing this process. They may go into the process for the money, but in return, the teacher, his/her classroom, and our state education results will see the results as well. I am a lifelong learner and am currently working on my masters in technology. I thank you for your support of this program, and opportunities to expand my knowledge about teaching and learning. I hope teachers will continue to reap the benefit of this amazing program for years to come and can also become more capable and more incitive professionals during the process. Thank you, Tara Gander

Comment: Governor Bev Perdue, Thank you for initiating North Carolina support for National Board candidates. I know the current economic stress is great, but National Board pursuit makes such a difference in one's teaching. I feel it is essential for North Carolina to continue to provide monetary support for those who choose to make the attempt. It is also important to continue the 12% monetary increase for ten years. This is one way to keep excellence in the classroom. Instead of moving into administration or higher education, K-12 teachers can afford to continue what they love most of all - teaching in the classroom. Sincerely, Elizabeth B Morrison, M Ed, NBCT OCS teacher Lake Norman High School

I want to thank you for you support in the National Boards process and certification for NC teachers. Thank you for you continued efforts for all education in our state.

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, Thank you for your continued support of the North Carolina National Board Certified Teachers of our state. I hope you will continue, in spite of our economic woes, to support this valuable program. I became a NBCT in 2005 and am trusting our state to continue the funding for this special hard worked for program. Children across the state benefit from highly qualified and reflective teachers. I know my teaching has improved and my students continue to achieve some of the highest scores in the state partly because of my work toward becoming an NBCT. I really need the extra pay the funding provides since my spouse is struggling in his job situation due directly to the state of the economy. Keep up your good work and may the Lord bless you richly. Thanks again for supporting our state NBCTs. Carolyn Valcourt

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue, I became a NBPTS teacher this year and so proud of my accomplishment. The rigorous process allowed me to challenge and examine myself as a teacher. Through the process, I became a more reflective, thoughtful teacher. I understand that you provided the groundwork to offer the opportunity to go through the NBPTS. Without the financial assistance it provided, I perhaps would have been unable to become a National Board Certified Teacher. I earned my master's degree three years before and I am still paying for it. Again, thank you for your upmost support of NC Education. I am excited to hear the news that Dr. Harrison has been selected as the new head of NC Education. I am also supportive of June Atkinson continuing to play a vital role in DPI. Again, thank you for all you are doing. I would like to volunteer to do what I can do to support your initiatives. Please let me know what I can do to help you improve NC education!

Subject: Continue to Support NBCT for NC

Comment: It has come to my attention that state support of teachers seeking National Board Certification might be in jeopardy due to cut backs and budget balancing. I am writing to ask that you do what ever you can to keep state incentives in place in NC. NC leads the country in the number of NBCT's, and I firmly believe that NC schools are better for it. Could you imagine where our schools would be without these teachers? The education of our children is the most important thing there is, and the more highly qualified teachers a school has, the better the education. A state couldn't invest in a better deal than that. So please do what ever it takes to keep helping teachers pay the assessment fee. Please, continue rewarding those teachers who have worked so hard to achieve the highest level of education to improve student learning. With Sincere Thanks, Grace C. Dorsey

This process allowed me to recognize what was working well for me but to also look at how I work daily in the classroom delivering instruction to my students. I hope that this initiative will continued to be supported by your current administration and our state legislature.

I understand that there is a proposal to eliminate the 12% salary differential for National Board Certified Teachers. Please, I beg you to reconsider this. It is imperative that you see the value in  continuing to monetarily support national board initiatives.

I have experienced significant professional growth and as a result of going through the national board process, I will continue to be a reflective practitioner. This benefits my students as I strive to develop more effective methods of teaching and reaching even the most challenging student.
Our students deserve the best education that we can give them and rewarding our teachers for going through this process is a way to insure that we give our children Highly Qualified educators who truly care about impacting our students and providing them with the best teaching strategies and methods. Please do not take away this incentive for teachers to go through this process. 
Why is it always children and educators who have to make the most sacrifices when money is an issue?  It seems that you would put your money where our future is...the children of NC.

Thank you,

Comment: I wanted to thank Governor Perdue for her continuing support of National Board Certification and National Board certified teachers in North Carolina. The National Board certification process is a wonderful professional growth experience for teachers, and it translates into higher quality teaching and learning for our students. The NC pay incentive for N.B. certified teachers also attracts much-needed professionals to our state. Again, thank you for your support of education in N.C. Sincerely, Brenda Puett, B.S.Ed., NBCT

Comment: I am a National Board Certified Teacher and I want to thank the state legislatures of the past and present for their support through compensations and incentives. I worked hard to acheive my certification and I work hard in my classroom with the kind of reflection that was instilled in me during my preparation for National Boards. I have supported other teachers since I received my Certification in 1994 who have also acheived. We have confidence in our teaching ability and we appreciate that our legislature feels comfortable and pleased to reward us for the job that we do. I invite you to come visit my class anytime at Franklin Elementary in Mt. Airy, NC. 336-786-2459 Sincerely, Jennifer Lowe NBCT

Subject: NBPTS

Comment: I just wanted to thank Governor Perdue, and her predecessors, for all their support with establishing NBPTS. It was an amazing process for me and reinforces my teaching efforts and beliefs. My hope is that other teachers continue to have the opportunity to go through this process. Teachers are so important for all children. It is a tremendous boost for teachers to have a way to be recognized for the tiring and sometimes unrewarded efforts. Again thank you for your support.

Comment: I want to recommend that NC continue to support its teachers in their quest for growth and excellence through National Board Certification. NC's educators are motivated and excited about this incredible opportunity to improve their practice b/c of the backing of the state. An investment in this program is an investment in the future of our great state. Students who attend classes in the classroom of a National Board Certified educator are clearly receiving a first rate public education. I think it's important to continue the states backing for this program for a brighter future for NC's youth! Please continue to fight for us Governor Purdue- we need your support! Sincerely, Stephanie Martin Kindergarten Teacher Pender County Schools

Comment: Please consider the importance of National Boards for teachers in this tough economic time. We work tirelessly for our pay and when efforts are made to improve our teaching effectiveness for students and families by achieving the NBPTS, our pay should not be penalized. It sends the wrong message to the teachers, students and families of every state. Our efforts should not be ignored or penalized. We don't make enough money as it is...

Comment: In these times of budget cuts, I would like to share my feelings on the importance of National Board certification to NC educational system. As a National Board certified teacher, I know how crucial National Board certification is to the professional development of NC educators. I believe in high standards for NC students and teachers. The National Board process strengthened my teaching skills and caused me to strive for excellence in my profession. Without the funding provided by NC, I would not have been able to afford the fees. Please continue to value NC education by supporting the National Board process. Natalie Burris 4th Grade Teacher Sherrills Ford, NC

Comment: Thank you for your support of National Board Certification for teachers. As teachers, that is the one recognition/prestige we have in this profession, and I would hate to have the pay taken away. Thousands of teachers have spent countless hours working toward this achievement, not to have it taken away. I welcome you to talk with me after school hours or on the weekend. Thank you for your continued support.
