Subject: State Tax Bill

Comment: Governor Perdue, Thank you for taking the time to read my e-mail.
First, congratulations on becoming our governor. I wish you all the success
during your term(s) in office. I am writing you regarding a personal matter
to me and my family, but I know that it is a personal matter to many in this
state, and indeed most of the country. I will be brief, but I do hope that
contacting my governor will be fruitful. My husband David and I are in Real
Estate. He works very hard and loves what he does. As you are very aware,
the housing market is not doing very well, but we continue to work and trust
that our economy will start to turn in the near future. My issue relates to
what we do for a living. We have been successful in the real estate
industry, and now like everyone else, we are struggling. Even though our
income has been cut in half, our expenses have remained the same in our
business. For that reason, we find ourselves behind in our state tax bill.
We currently owe more than $9000.00 for 2007 that we are having difficulty
paying. I always pay my bills, every one of them, however the money I put
aside to pay the final bill for 2007 I had to use to pay my mortgage, food
for my 3 children, etc. We have contacted the state regarding the tax bill,
but they are unwilling to give us an extention. Governor Perdue, I know that
you are not the one reading this e-mail, so whoever it is that has the
ability to respond, please help me in getting some kind of extention for
this bill. I know money is tight for us, as well as the state, but I am
hoping that someone can work with us. I anxiously await a response. Thanks
again for your time and consideration. Jenny Lee

Subject: Tax Fraud

Comment: Dear Governor Bev Perdue, My name is Vadis Fields. Every year that
I file my taxes,someone has used my dependants. This is the third time this
has happen. I have file amended taxes to resolve the issue and to show the
government that I am the mother and the children resides with me. I have
mailed proof to the IRS in 2006 such as birth certificates, school records,
copy of lease, and medicaid cards. I have contacted the local IRS and the
main IRS office reporting the fraudulent claim that someone has claimed. I
tried to file my taxes and found out that I couldn't claim my dependants. I
Don't who it is, but the Government or IRS Know who has claimed my
dependants. It is not fair to me. I am a single parent struggling. How can I
get this situation resolved and be able to get the earn income credit? How
can I get theIRS to release the tax money due to me without going through
the mail? I tried to file electronical through H&R Block and my taxes was
rejected because of this matter. How can I get the IRS to take action
against the guilty? Thank you for helping me with this matter. Please feel
free to call me at (336)727-2711. Sincerely, Vadis Fields

Subject: Taxes

Comment: Dear Beverly Purdue, We had to move out of California in November
2008, because we could no longer afford to live there. It was a hard
decision because we both really liked Sonoma County where we lived. We also
both really liked our jobs with Kendall-Jackson, I worked there for 12 years
and my husband had been there for 5. We made good money, or so we thought,
but with our mortgage and daycare for two babies under 3, we were barely
making it paycheck to paycheck. Because of the housing market we had to make
a choice on how to get out from under our house, keep trying to pay, let the
bank foreclose or sell it in a short sale. We were trying to do the right
thing and so we decided to do a short sale, so the bank would get something.
0Apparently letting the bank foreclose would have been the better option. We
were just informed by our tax lady that we owe California $2851.00 and the
Federal Government over $6636.00, because of our cancellation of debt on the
short sale of the home we used to own. In the past we have usually gotten
back at least $6,000. It makes me feel very sick inside since we tried to do
the right thing and now only have around $50 in the bank, after cashing in
and using our 401ks and any saving we had. We are very frustrated because we
moved to give our family a better life and we knew it would be hard starting
over. My husband had been promised a job, which never worked out. Both of us
are very experienced in our fields and we have had no luck finding jobs. For
the first time ever I had to go to the state we now live in for assistance,
so thankfully we have Medicaid and food stamps for our family. My
Mother-in-law owns the home we live in and she has agreed to sell it to us,
but we need to have money coming in, so we can make monthly payments. Us not
having money to pay her, affects her household. The place we are living
every room needs something done to it, major and minor upgrading. When we
first arrived we had to spend a week in a hotel, just to make it livable for
our family. Thankfully my husband is very handy so he can fix just about
anything, but it takes money, which we are lacking at this point. I've been
selling things that I'd rather not have to sell, and my husband has been
trying to find odd jobs or anything, just to make a few bucks, but none of
it covers our bills. Our bills are much less then what they were in
California, but with no money coming in everything seems huge right now. In
California we owed $500,000 now we owe around $50,000 and that includes the
purchase of the place we are living. We both filed for unemployment, through
California I received an approval letter and a claim form, but almost a
month later, still no check and I can't get through to anyone. My husband
filed almost 6 weeks ago and has been trying to call to find out the status
of his with no luck. We've just been trying to do the right thing. My
husband was so stressed when we were in California it was affecting his
health. He ended up in the ER several times with chest pains and shortness
of breath. I had to call 911 once when he collapsed in our driveway. With
everything going on and now the news of owing all this tax money for a sale
that we never saw any money from, I fear him relapsing. It scares me for
many reasons, I'm in a new area that I'm not familiar with and I have two
babies and my husband to worry about. Please explain to me how two people
who have worked so hard their whole lives (I'm 40, he's 37) can end up
getting screwed in the end because the banks got greedy? I'm hoping maybe
there is someway you can help us. If we would have received some of that
bailout money that was given to the banks, we could have caught up on our
mortgage and maybe we could have stayed in California. We fill that we
should not owe the taxes listed above, especially after everything we did to
try and right our bad situation with the bank and all the taxes we had paid
last year while working. Like I mentioned we are frustrated for trying to do
the right thing and now we have nothing and no way to improve our financial
status which was our over goal and reason for the major move. We know at
some point we will catch a break, get out from under our debt and enjoy
watching our children grow into wise young men. Our plan is to teach them to
save for things you want and pay for it outright. We don't buy anything
anymore unless we can pay for it outright. Again, we are asking for your
advise, somehow to get rid of these outrages taxes and help us get through
to someone in California, so at least my unemployment checks would start
coming while we continue searching for jobs.with that we would be able to
get by. Thank you for your time, looking forward to your opinion, Samantha

Subject: [Aid4Mail Trial tag #18374] Marilyn Nevins - Earned income tax credit age limitation
Content-Type: text/plain;
	charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
X-Folder: Revenue

Dear Ms. Nevins

Your email to the Governor's office has been forwarded to me for a reply.

The earned income tax credit eligibility requirements are found in Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code.  One of the limitations is that the credit is available only to workers who are at least age 25 and under age 65.  The rational for age limits was to limit the cost of the credit and to target it to persons who depend on earnings for a large portion of their support.  The fact that a worker was eligible for full Social Security benefits at age 65 (now 66) was also a likely consideration in determining the age limitation of 65.  Because the North Carolina earned income tax credit is based on the federal credit, the age limitations provided in federal law are applicable for North Carolina purposes.

We understand your concerns regarding the credit.  You may be interested to know that some organizations, such as AARP, are advocating elimination of the age limitations.  However, any change would require legislative action by the U. S. Congress.

Please let us know if you have additional questions.

Very truly yours,


Sam McEwen
Assistant Director
Personal Taxes Division
Department of Revenue

Dec of 08. She left her house and land to me and my brother. She was in
assisted living. We have contacted Raleigh and the lady we spoke with says
we should owe around 10 grand to the state. This was on Dec 28 of 08. We
have called up there 4 to 5 times since then. All I want is a bill so that I
can build a house on the land that she left me. I can not build until this
issue is resolved. I just think it is funny that you have someone here who
has to call a beg to give the state money. It has been almost 2 monthes
since we have contacted Raleigh. WILL YOU PLEASE HELP US. Thanks James

Comment: I received notice that I owed $183.35 from 2007 taxes....$175 for
amended report +8.35 interest. I am mailing a copy of the information to
you.I sent a copy of the check for $175 which was paid in May of last year.
I received another form letter stating they could not waiver interest on tax
due. They consider the file closed and I was told to pay the $183.35. This

Someone did call me about my tax refund - but, a "computer glitch" was mentioned in the conversation and then I see this article in the Newspaper (attached).

I am unemployed - I filed online so that I could do an electronic return and get my money back sooner.  $2,840 - I cashed in a 401K this year due to being unemployed and AST took out too much for State.  I have the form where I chose 7% but - for some reason - they chose to make the percentage higher - so, you have had "my" money for about a half a year.   

We, as taxpayers don't get to choose when we pay our taxes.

           "Lay said his agency is having trouble tapping special funds needed to keep its cash flow at a comfortable level, and           the state doesn't want to deplete all the money."

Subject: North Carolina Department of Revenue

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I have copied and pasted here my wonderful
experiences with the state of North Carolina since I retired from the
military and for some reason chose North Carolina to move to. I dare say the
largest mistake I have made in my life and one that I will truly regret for
the rest of my life. Very respectfully, David Campbell
____________________________________________________ Good Day Linda Douglas,
NCDOR This was as little help as could be offered. My issue has nothing to
do with any kind of legislation. My wages are now being garnished and I am
paying more taxes than anyone in my tax bracket would ever pay due to the
state of north carolina basically saying this is what we want and we are
just going to take it and there is nothing you can do about it. Thankfully
they finally accepted what I sent and I am not stuck paying 2004 taxes as
well. It is really overwhelming when you have to find so much proof that you
didn't live here and they refuse what you thought was beyond proof. I have
been told that being a retired disabled veteran that I should be receiving a
$4000 tax break right off the top... I have no idea what is being done about
that. I have now had to leave employment and surviving off my military
retainer and a part-time job. This is not a lot of money during these times
and with a handicapped child things are very stressful. With the help of God
and my ability to live on nothing, The Governor and the Honorable Kenneth R.
Lay should be very comfortable. Thanks for all of your assistance. David

9193045159 Message: I've written before and have had nice return calls, but
nothing is getting done. I send the paperwork that shows my acutal earnings
for 2005 and that I did not live here in 2004 and I receive no responses
after that... it is like pretend you don't get it and he'll pay if we just
keep bothering him. I have received another letter from the department of
revenue saying they will begin taking my tax refunds, both federal and
state. I really don't know what else to do. The IRS makes a mistake and they
now have thiers corrected, but I've got to live with North Carolina's
mistake. I can only send the proof of what my earnings were and what was
paid... I don't know what else you want. You got the incorrect information
from the IRS originally, why don't you go back and get the corrected
information yourself. I've sent it in twice now with nothing to show for it.
It was a fairly simple error at that... This had been my first year to file
with a 1099 from being retired militay and I claim the taxable part under
the correct line and they came back to say I did not claim this money
because it wasn't under income. Of course what they sent to North Carolina
was the form showing what I did not claim. I really don't know why I moved
here, the school system is well behind what I thought they would be and the
taxes are insane. Thanks.

Subject: Wage Attachment North Carolina Dept Of revenue

Comment: I hope you can help me with an issue I have tried to resolve with
the NC Dept Of Revenue. I have a wage attachment placed with my employer
from the NC Dept of Revenue for $1478.00. I had a refund of $1656.00 which
they applied to that amount. They still say I owe $104.00. I do not see how
that can be since they took the $1656.00 towards the $1478.00 tax due Also
there was a wage attachment placed to my pay which I have already pair
$278.00 plus an additional $271.00 taken out of my pay which still has not
been applied. I have requested to have the wage attachment taken off my pay
but no one has called me back on this matter. I am getting $278.00 taken out
of my pay each pay and would like to see if you could resolve this matter
for me. I did not receive any phone calls back from the Dept of Rev and feel
I am getting the run around. I am due monies now and feel I am getting
treated unfair. My husband had lost his job and we can not afford to have
any more monies taken from us. Please help me to resolve this matter before
any more mones are taken from me. My name is Elizabeth Allison ss# REMOVED
BY GOVERNOR'S OFFICE address 6506 Weldon Circle Concord North Carolina

check into this matter. I have tried the Charlotte Officer as well and left
messages for Karen Lewis without any reponse and spoke to about 5 different
people in the Dept Of revenue. I understand this is a busy year but I do
need the wage attachment taken off my pay and my monies due me returned to
me as soon as possible. Thank You, Elizabeth Allison

Comment: I think the citizens of North Carolina have a right to know if
refunds are being held by the NC Department of Revenue. I have read much
speculation about this online. In past years efiled returns were processed
in as little as 8 days. I know people that have been waiting for as long as
30 days now including my own family. It is time for transparency and
honestly in the government.

Ann:

Is this a Revenue issue? Unfortunately, far too many people think we should
know which agency they're referring to by providing "Raleigh" as their point
of contact.

Subject: I owe the state money. I need a bill. 

Comment: My grandmother pasted away in Aug of 08 and then my home burnt down
Dec of 08. She left her house and land to me and my brother. She was in
assisted living. We have contacted Raleigh and the lady we spoke with says
we should owe around 10 grand to the state. This was on Dec 28 of 08. We
have called up there 4 to 5 times since then. All I want is a bill so that I
can build a house on the land that she left me. I can not build until this
issue is resolved. I just think it is funny that you have someone here who
has to call a beg to give the state money. It has been almost 2 monthes
since we have contacted Raleigh. WILL YOU PLEASE HELP US. Thanks James
