Dear Mr. Shawgo:

Your e- mail sent to the Office of the Governor was forwarded to this Division for a response.  Thank you for the opportunity to share information with you.

It appears you and your wife are experiencing a custody dilemma and I regret she is not allowing you to speak with your son as often as you or he desires.  I am uncertain who you have spoken with in Iredell County, however if you have spoken with Iredell County Department of Social Services (DSS) and they have informed you they cannot assist you in either visiting or talking to your son, they are correct in doing so.  If the local DSS is not involved with the mother and son, they have no legal authority to interfere in this matter and by law, cannot do so.  Neither can the Governor's Office or any other government office assist you with this matter.  Because your situation involves a custody concern, you will be best aided by contacting a Family Law or Child Custody Attorney and discussing the matter with him or her.  An attorney can best advise you what should be done in this situation so you can resume communicating with and seeing your son.  I hope you are soon able to get this matter resolved.

Thank you for contacting the Office of the Governor with your concern.  If there is a need to contact this office again, I can be reached by phone at the number listed below or toll free within the state at 1.800.662.7030, which is our Care-Line.  I can also be reached via e-mail at <mailto:Valarie.Johnson@ncmail.net>Valarie.Johnson@ncmail.net.

Dear Mrs. Price:



Governor Beverly Eaves Perdue asked that I respond to your email regarding your mother’s Medicaid eligibility through the Special Assistance program.  The Division of Medical Assistance (DMA) administers the Medicaid program in North Carolina.  Please be assured of my interest and concern for your situation.



When an individual is living in an assisted living facility, they may be eligible for Medicaid if they meet the Special Assistance (SA) program requirements.  To be eligible for SA, an individual must be eligible for SSI, or ineligible for SSI solely due to income.  SA recipients are automatically eligible for Medicaid. 



Some assisted living facilities include a special care unit such as your mother’s Alzheimer’s unit.  To be eligible for SA in the special care unit and therefore receive automatic Medicaid, the individual’s income must be less than the SA rate set by the North Carolina General Assembly (currently $1,515 per month) plus the personal needs allowance (currently $46 per month).  The total monthly income limit for SA eligibility is $1,561.   Your mother’s income of $1,700 per month makes her ineligible for this program.



As you mention, your mother may be eligible for long term care Medicaid in a skilled nursing facility (nursing home).  The income eligibility requirements for this are different from the SA requirements.  Unfortunately, there are no exceptions that would allow your mother to qualify under the SA program.

Subject: Assisted Living vs Nursing Home



Comment: My Mom has Alzheimers and has lived in an Assisted living in an Alzheimers unit for the past four years. Because she went to work after my father died 45 years ago and she received retirement and SS of about $1700 a month, (we pay $5400 a month for AL Home)the only way she could receive medicaid was if she went to a nursing home which is more expensive than the AL Home. In order to provide her with the care she needed, I have sold her farm and I have sold her home, and now by the end of July we will be broke and will be forced to move her to a nurisng home. I could have kelp her home but I would have to move her to a nursing home. As hard as it was, I sold her home so she could recieve the care she needed. If she had never gone to work and just lived off the government after my Dad died, she could stay in the AL Home. There are other people living were she is who can stay and medicaid covers them because they make under $1500 a month. Mom is under Hospice care and moving her is one of the worst things we can do at this point. Over the years our tax money has gone to support people who won't work. I am begging you to treat my Mom like you would if she had not worked hard to raise her family. Please make medicaid let her stay where she is. It will not only let her live out her time where she feels at home it will save the state money. Over the years I have contacted every politian there was and I have only been told it was not their job or they were not going to even try to change the law. Yes Mom has Alzheimers but she is still a human being. Please help me do what is best for her. It is just wrong to make her go where she can not receive the care she needs just because she went to work. You are my last hope and I know if there are rules then there can be exceptions to the rules. Please contact me at 919-943-3553 or cell 919-202-9269.

Dear Mr. Remeta:

Your email to the Governor's office regarding the I-85 bridge was forwarded to me for response. NCDOT staff is completing our application for Federal Discretionary funding that we plan to use to replace the bridge over the Yadkin River. All proposed projects entered for funding must meet specific guidelines and no one state can request more than $300 million.  It is our priority to aggressively pursue that maximum amount for the project. We have not been given a timeline for how soon after the delivery of our application that we will get a response from the federal government. Once that decision is made, we can move forward with our planning.

We continue to consider the Yadkin  River Bridge our number one priority due to its state and regional significance.  As you are well aware, replacement of this bridge is critical to the long-term safety of our citizens and the economic well-being of the region as a corridor utilized by major industry to move goods.

Once our application is completed, it will be posted on our web site at <http://www.ncdot.gov>www.ncdot.gov. In addition, a web section with additional information beyond the application regarding the I-85 project will be posted and available for viewing.

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott

Dear Ms. Snead:



Thank you for your letter regarding the use NC Education Lottery dollars.  The Governor appreciates hearing from constituents who are concerned about the educational welfare of our state’s youth.



 The North Carolina Education Lottery was established to ensure we are providing high quality pre-kindergarten for at-risk four-year-olds, smaller classes in grades K-3, and funding for critical school construction needs in fast-growing and low-wealth counties, as well as college scholarships. For more information on how lottery dollars are spent, please visit their website at: <http://www.nc-educationlottery.org/>http://www.nc-educationlottery.org/  and click on “Where the Money Goes”.

Subject: Explanations needed - thanks




Many people are wondering why with the State getting so much lottery money (or supposed to be), why this is not taking care of the education shortfalls.  We were never anywhere near this desperation prior to the lottery in the 1980's and while economy is much worse now, it sure seems the education lottery money would keep teachers teaching and any extra cuts to state budget could go to help the other Important State employees keep their jobs and not have to take furloughs and cuts.



All state employees (including teachers) are important and without them you would not need art centers, acquariums, parks, etc.  In my opinion money should be made available to them first and any cuts be made to those things mentioned.  Even our State law enforcement personnel are being forced to take furloughs and cuts when our crime is increasing; is that really wise?   Are they any less important?



Thanks for listening to a concerned citizen.  Peggy Snead, Manteo

Dear Ms. Johnson:



Thank you for your e-mail regarding paying for college.  The issues you describe regarding payments for education are understandable.  Paying for school can be quite a financial commitment, coupled with day-to-day, on-going financial obligations.  If you have not, I recommend you contact the North Carolina State Higher Education Assistance Authority (NCSHEAA) at P.O. Box 13663, RTP, NC  27709 or by phone at 919/549-8614 to speak directly with a loan representative.  The staff at NCSHEAA is equipped and knowledgeable about various financial assistance options available. Additionally, you can contact the College Foundation of North Carolina for information regarding scholarships, grants and loans.  They can be reached at 1-877-877-2362.



Thank you again for contacting our office.

Hopefully I'll not sound mad about it ,But where's the BEEF???? Thanking You for taking the time to read this.....Maby some of that money could go towards paying the Teachers instead of looking to layoff anyone! Kat Bauer

FYI



Dear, Ms Good,

The Governor’s Office has received your letter and has asked the Department of Commerce to respond. I am pleased to do so. In response to your request for information about grants for your businesses, I would offer the following information:



Generally speaking, grants for small businesses are very rare.  Exceptions may be for new cutting edge technology, green technology companies and non-profits.



There is pending legislation in the legislature for a revolving loan fund called the “Small Business Assistance Fund”, but it will have to make it through to the final House budget before it will be available.   



The Stimulus Package does not provide "grants" to individuals or small businesses specifically.  This package brings funding for public works projects, new infrastructure projects, residential & commercial weatherization projects and clean technology & renewable energy projects and others that will offer contracting opportunities and jobs for people in North Carolina and across the US. In addition, there are some minor changes in SBA lending in both the 2008 Economic Stimulus Package—see: <http://www.sba.gov/stimulus/>http://www.sba.gov/stimulus/ and the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009 <http://www.sba.gov/recovery/index.html>http://www.sba.gov/recovery/index.html that may potentially benefit small businesses. In-depth information relating to the Stimulus Package how the money can be used in North Carolina is outlined on the new website set up by Governor Perdue

As a word of caution, there are many "grants scams" out on the internet that are misleading and not representing official governmental organizations or websites.  All legitimate federal grant programs are cataloged online at <http://www.cfda.gov>www.cfda.gov (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance).



In addition, the Small Business & Technology Development Center has developed an online official publication where sources of capital and loan programs may be identified called "Capital Opportunities for Small Businesses in NC: <http://www.sbtdc.org/publications/cap_opps.asp>http://www.sbtdc.org/publications/cap_opps.asp 



I hope this information is helpful. I encourage you to look at the Department of Commerce Website: www. nccommerce.com for regular information to assist entrepreneurs. I am wondering if you have contacted Self Help Credit Union in Durham which specializes in services to small businesses. Self Help has a Raleigh branch near you at 19 W. Hargett; telephone: 755-2232. I will contact you if new funds become available through the General Assembly’s new program.



Sincerely,

Gail McDonald

Subject: Small business help

Comment: Greetings, I am writing to get some help with financing my new business. I have good credit, but cant find a loan anywhere and I have tried for months. Now I am about to loose my building as I have depleted my savings. My new cafe and lounge would create 35-40 jobs here in Raleigh. I had planned on using my credit cards and obtaining a SBA backed loan, but no bank is still lending. My cards have been reduced or canceled because of the economy (for no other reason). I have my building, and have started renovations, but I'm out of cash and cant find a lender still making unsecured loans or sba backed loans. Can your office advise? Where is the stimulus that is supposed to help? I would be injecting 200k in taxes each year plus dozens of jobs! I work full time and put every dime into this place, but its not going to be enough. Is there any program, anything at all that doesn't take 6 months just to be told no, sorry? Does your office know of any lender, or have any pull with anyone you can point me towards? Thank you, Eileen

Email: gohot229@yahoo.com 

Subject: Fiscal debt and how to save $$$

Comment: Governor: What about all the Mills in the State that are empty and shut down. The Prison system has an unlimited number of inmates that would be happy to work to offset and fund their canteen privliges. By starting mills with the low wages paid prisoners, they could possably become competative with the off-shore factories that left with NAFTA and also outsourcing over the recent years. If a factory was working, the colateral jobs would increase and would also start a re-emergence of in state(s) return to made in the USA as production would take place here along with goods and services needed by such an operation. Tax benefits could coax back parent companies to the states and perhaps start a movement. Win-Win in that prisoners can work and are much happier, the economy is revived, and that Manufacturing returns to the US. Along these lines, out of work teachers could fill the Foreman positions and dirrect company production. The savings the prison system could make would be substantial, additionally two things could happen, #1 training of prisoners for Civilian activities after terms were served. #2The prison system could finally run in the Black with actual profit. #3 the prisoners, with something to ocupy their time would be much more content, thus eliminating some or most violence associated with idleness. #4 the economy throughout would profit from encreases in civilian activity in comerce and goods and re-establishing Companies and production bact to the USA on a permenant basis.

Raleigh, N. C. 27699-4701 (919) 733-2126 919) 715-8477 ] Greetings to
you at the North Carolina: Department of Correction and to the Crime
Control and Public Safety, my name is Mr. Dwayne Keith Mobley and today
I am writing to you this letter, First: to let the Department of
Corrections, know that I have not received a letter from them concerning
my complaints against them and what I felt toward them getting access of
my medical life and possibly using this information, but on a personal
scale. As I also feel that the people who did this no longer work for
the DOC. Second: I am also writing this letter this way because of the
lack of cooperation you have given to me, as this is now going on five
years of me faxing to the DOC, of North Carolina. I have written to the
Medical Director, in specific because of what knowledge and access you
have in getting your own understanding of this matter, but I am unsure
of you level of comprehension of me. But I feel strongly about the lack
of care for the safety that took place while I was an inmate some nine
years ago, in August. Inmate number 0656154, is the number I was given
and with the people who I am against in me gaining my full identity, it
may not still be the same, as I even took a video when I entered the
system. The safety was not there for me as I sat in prison, the same
people who caused me to go, were outside the prison all the time,
stopping the other inmate guess as they came to visit them and made
comments of towards me, putting my safety in jeopardy. I stressed how my
U.S. mail was theft and fraud, from people who have access to my mail
and no one did anything. In fact every legal document that came to me
was fraud and even now today that act has continued. If you can see how
these acts are play out by the same people, you will see why you both
are addressed in this letter. And please do not mention contacting the
Postal Inspection Services, because as an inmate I could not and since I
have been free, I have, but these people who these complaints are about
are not weak in influence. Why would they want my medical history and me
go through those entire tests I took while in prison? Check for
yourself, if I was going to only be there for eight month, I needed my
teeth fixed, in which they totally overlooked. As I understand no one is
to be sitting around the prison. Well these people did and they had no
one to stop them. And if you would like to know of these people, just
check into the county that sent me to prison, where my violations took
place. I question of whether they have my right identity on file, as
well. When is a patient, inmate or not; when? Could the value of
something get him or her overlooked and even to the point of medical
experimentation. Because even the county of where I once lived found out
about unfortunate medical history and at that time I was able to pay for
my medical expenses, but they needed my history, what would be the best
way, send him to prison for something. I say this lightly, because I am
no model citizen and I did my share of badness, but look at my record;
you will see that there were other offensives that could have sent me
away much longer. You know why they didnâ€™t because they knew that I
had nothing to do with what they ran into and it made them look totally
corrupt doing me that way. Look at what violated my probation, I got
shot. I got shot for pictures I had taken for me of people of interest
and they were taken that night I was shot. I know I am going on about
this, but I am really trying to make you understand that medical
experimentation took place a long time ago and I had no knowledge, but I
have been catching on and since then I want some answers! If you feel I
may be wrong; check! , If you write to me back in response to this,
please pay special attention to weather I get your letter or not,
because all my U.S. Mail, is watched and at times returned to say
differently, as they people who want this are the very same people I am
writing to you about. But I do look forwarded to you written letter!
Just about any given morning I am here at the Warrenton County Memorial
Library, writing of ways to bring light of a very dark situation. I
value the written word, as to your letter of response! My country is
fighting me back and I amagain. I am the Pursuer of Justice.

The claimant needs to have the issue of his severance pay adjudicated.  
We have already gathered the needed information and his claim is

by his severance pay will be issued no later than Tuesday, 7/7/09.

Matt,



Your note to Governor Purdue was forwarded to me for response.



A green energy job or business is one which involves saving energy or producing energy from renewable sources.  Some examples here in North Carolina include:



Piedmont Biofuels – makes diesel fuel from waste oils and fats (e.g. used French fry oil)

Carolina Wood Pellets – Makes fuel pellets for residential stoves and commercial boilers from the waste wood of a sawmill.

Southern Energy Management – Installs solar energy systems for the production of hot water or electricity from the sun.

Megawatt Solar – Manufactures solar electric systems which use curved mirrors to concentrate the sun

Advanced Energy – conducts research and promotes the technologies which save energy and improve energy efficiency.



I hope that this helps.

Thank you for your hard work to try and balance the NC budget.

I still am curious what exactly green energy jobs and businesses are.  I am hoping that someone in your office can give an example of a green business or a green energy job.

Thank you.

Subject: Larry D. Murphy opus # 0296973

Comment: Gonernor Perdue: RE: Larry D. Murphy opus# 0296973 I know that the Govenor is in charge of appointing the Parole and Pardons Commission, and I would like for something to be done about the fact that I, the allegeded victim, who had recanted my childhood testimony, because it was a false memory, and no one wants to listen or admit that a child could actually mistake the identy of the person who had abused her.. Anyways, my dad came up for a parole hearing in October of 2008, and they still have not made a decsion.. They will not give me an answer as to what the hold up is? Why they can not make a decision... I realize that there is a lot to factor in, and that there are a lot of people that have to be notified... and things that have to be considered, but given the fact that the victim has contiusouly stood behind her father, and has tried to do everything legally possible to get him out, and noone will listen to her.. This man has been in prison for 20 years simply on the word of a very angry 10 year old girl.... That seems very wrong.. Is there some pressure that you could put on the Parole Board to make a decision, please? Thank you for looking into this very important matter to our family... Respectively yours, Julie Murphy

This is to acknowledge receipt of your e-mail to Governor Beverly Eaves Perdue, which was forwarded to the North Carolina Department of Correction Public Affairs Office. You are seeking information about changes in sentencing laws and the possibility of bringing back parole.



At this time, no new sentencing laws have been enacted. Any change to North Carolina laws would require action by the North Carolina legislature.  Every year, many bills are introduced that never become law. 



You may also want to check out the Web link: <http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/>http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/  At this site you can look up pending bills and also find out who represents your district.

An inquiry was forwarded to me regarding oversight of homeowners' associations.  

The Department of the Secretary of State does handle incorporations of nonprofit corporations and unincorporated associations.  Many homeowners' associations are incorporated as nonprofits.  The Department does not, however, regulate homeowners' associations.  Internal management issues in homeowners' associations are a matter for the members of the associations to resolve, either through their internal by-laws processes or by using the courts system.

As far as I know, at this time there is no State or federal agency which regulates or oversees homeowners' associations.

There is a bill which is before the General Assembly which would provide oversight of homeowners' association managers in some circumstances.  The bill is:  House Bill 762 (=  Senate 516)  Community Association Managers Licensure.

Thank you for your inquiry.

Ms. Harris;



The Governorâ€™s Office has referred your inquiry to the Cemetery Commission for response.



As we have previously indicated with our response to your e-mail inquiry of May 11th (below), there are no minimum requirements for cemetery maintenance.Â  The Cemetery Commission cannot enforce standards unless set by General Statutes.Â  It is not uncommon for the Cemetery Commission to receive concerns from citizens regarding cemetery appearance and maintenance throughout the State, but again, maintenance and appearance are not mandated.



Concerning the composition of the Cemetery Commission, contrary to your understanding, the most recent membership consists of five cemetery owners, one retired former cemetery owner and two managers of larger corporate cemetery concerns.Â 



Further, once a perpetual care cemetery is established and licensed, a minimum of thirty acres of land must be maintained as a cemetery unless â€œgrandfatheredâ€.Â  True, any excess land beyond thirty acres may generally be sold for other purposes, but only if there are no interments thereon.



Hopefully this answers your concerns.Â  The next meeting of the Cemetery Commission is to occur August 5th beginning at 10:00 in Suite 242 of the Oakwood Office Building located at 1100 Navaho Drive, near Wake Forest Road in Raleigh.Â  The meeting is open to the public and if you wish to address the Commission, we have a roster on which you may indicate that desire.

Unfortunately, the N.C. General Statutes governing Perpetual Care Cemeteries, Article 9, Chapter 65 (The Cemetery Act), do not have minimum standards.Â  The only provision is that the cemetery cannot be deemed a "...public nuisance of a health or safety hazard.".Â  The meaning of Perpetual Care is only loosely defined.Â  If markers are damaged by personnel of the cemetery, they are obligated to repair/replace; if damaged by other sources or are soiled, the cemetery has no legal responsibility.Â  Most Perpetual Care cemeteries have self-imposed responsibilities to straighten and reset markers that are askew or sunken; but again, that is not mandated by law.



Â 



You can request a complaint from be mailed to you for completion and return to this office.Â  However, we cannot force a cemetery owner to do more than is legally required.Â  We do utilize coercion, though.

I have family that is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Durham,NC. My family and I wanted to know what rule does a cemetery have. How much care do they have to do for ground and markers? This place has a lot of damage from back hoe. If a owner doesn't care for a cemetery, what can be done about it?

Thank You

Subject: Grave yard in North Carolina

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue I vote on you. Hoping that you would in force the law in North Carolina. There are several things wrong with the maintance of grave yard in North Carolna. First off the North Carolina Cemetery Commission is not made up of the same people that own Cemeteries. They protect the developer that buy cemeteries for there land and then make housing developements out of them. But never care for the people who are buried near them. I have talk to alot of people that tell me that calling on you and other to help is a waste of time. You have family like myslef that are buried somewhere. We trust these cemeteries in our weakest time to care for our family. I wish that I could talk to someone in this matter from your office. Instead I get a copy of a law that not inforced by your office.

Thank you but my original request was made on June 12 and I can provide that to you if needed. If this information that you have given me is policy, then I would have certainly understood.I was at first given very vague and frankly puzzling information about my request. However, I thought the new policy under Gov. Perdue was that all applications would be available on line. I need this information before the deadline to file for election, but I see that this will not be possible. I certainly thought that a request made on June 12 would have a quicker turn around time and I thought all grant applications were in the public domain and could be accessed electronically. I can only image how difficult it must be for someone, for example, in Bryson City to get such information. I will come to Raleigh to get copies when notified. Thank you. Elissa Yount

Office of Governor Bev Perdue <blockedhttp://www.governor.state.nc.us/>



State of the Budget



For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the

impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced

first-hand.



In that time, our state's unemployment rate has almost doubled and now

stands at 11.1 percent - 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolina's

families have been hurt by the recession, so has our state's budget.



The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a

decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal

year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the

country, and it is the largest in North Carolina's history.



Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve

significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in

January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and

transparency to ensure North Carolina's government is working in the best

interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough

times.



This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the

public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have

instituted more accountability and transparency in our state's mental health

and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making

at the Department of Transportation.



Through my JobsNOW <blockedhttp://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>  initiative, we are

putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery

dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my 12 in

6 program

<blockedhttp://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?ne

wsItemID=299> , a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for

high-demand jobs in less than six months.



Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this

state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I

presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education,

priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolina's long-term

economic growth.



Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1

billion.



As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included

profound cuts to core government services.



We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public

safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to

cripple our classrooms.



Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving

North Carolina's economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs.

Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and

would cut short our long-term economy.



As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will

need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the

bone.



I've traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue

necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget

crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including

health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of

jobs and protect our children's education.



The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a

budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our

children and our economic future depend on it.







          Sincerely,



 Bev

Thank you for your recent inquiry to the Governor’s Office.  They have asked that I respond.  I am glad to address the question of where the lottery funds have gone.



Through yesterday, sales to date have been over $ 3.5 billion.   We make transfers to the Office of State Budget and Management quarterly.  Our last transfer was made July 1 and was based on sales through the end of June.  We have transferred over $1.136 billion to North Carolina.



The Lottery Act specifies how the lottery proceeds will be spent.  The Act designates that 50% is to be split between at-risk four-year old pre-K and K-3 class size reduction; 40% to school construction; and 10% to college scholarships.   It takes an act of the Governor or the Legislature to alter this designation.  The following hot links list the lottery allocations by county for fiscal years 07 and 08:  <http://www.nc-educationlottery.org/uploads/docs/Beneficiary%20Brochure%20fy2008.pdf>FY '08 Beneficiary Brochure   <http://www.nc-educationlottery.org/uploads/docs/Beneficiary%20Brochure%20fy2007.pdf>FY '07 Beneficiary Brochure.  The FY09 brochure will be prepared after the fiscal year ends.  These brochures don’t show what the counties have received this year because we don’t have that information yet. You can find more information on the lottery webpage at <http://www.nc-educationlottery.org/about_where-the-money-goes.aspx>http://www.nc-educationlottery.org/about_where-the-money-goes.aspx.



The education lottery has accomplished what the Legislature envisioned when it was created.  The money is going where directed by law.  The lottery was never designed to meet all the budget needs of education.  We cover roughly 4% of the education budget.  The education budget is greater than 50% of the total state budget.  The K-12 annual budget is over $8 billion.  Education funding needs are significant.  At the lottery, we are extremely pleased that we have added over $1 billion that was not previously available.  The Governor is trying to fill a one-year $3 billion hole in the budget.  Without the lottery, that hole would be bigger.



Getting the word out about where the money has gone has proven difficult.  We appreciate the interest of citizens such as you and are glad to be able to provide this information

Gov. Perdue,

What impact has the NCEL ( North Carolina Education Lottery) had on educational resources in North Carolina. I listened to the celebration this past May when the  announcement of the lottery returns stated an amount in the millions of dollars.



What has happened to all that money over the last 3 years?? Has there been mismanagement of the dollars brought in from the lottery? Which was the initial reaction from the public when the lottery was first put up for vote 10 years or so ago.



If the lottery money is not going to be put toward education, then by God, it should be discontinued for the state of North Carolina.



I know that that the revenue from the state lottery should have made a big impact on our education, but the wrong, and I do mean wrong, people are in charge of the distribution of the funds if we are having all the deficits that you mention in your email.



What will you do about this?

Subject: Homeowner's Assistance Program

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am writing you because my husband who is a SSgt with the United States Marine Corps recently reported to Camp Lejeune, NC due to military orders; we had to leave our home empty and unsold in VA. Due to his orders, we were unable to receive an offer for our home that would cover what we still owed. We qualify for the HAP; but because it is so slow in coming, we are about to miss our first mortgage payment coming in July. We have paid our mortgage on time for the last 3 years; but due to the difference in housing allowance; we can no longer afford to make the payments. We had to leave before the house was sold and now it sits empty. My husband could very well lose his security clearance if the house has to go into foreclosure. We have sought help from 2 different senators, 1 in VA and the other here in NC. We don't know where else to turn. Nothing is being done to help us and we have done nothing wrong. He if following military orders to be here, how is it that he fights for the freedoms of this nation; but no one fights for him? We could really use your help with this situation. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Maria Marker praise2jc@gmail.com 540-455-6448 910-327-2102

Dear Mrs. Marker:



The Office of Governor Beverly E. Perdue forwarded your complaint letter to the Office of the Commissioner of Banks for a response to your mortgage related issues. 



We previously responded to the Governor’s Office that you may want to consider contacting the Virginia authorities about the property foreclosure in that state.  However, in order for this office to address your problem with the lender on your North Carolina property, you will need to file a formal complaint with this agency, asking your mortgage company to work with you during this period of financial difficulty.  If the mortgage company is a company is we regulate we may be able to assist you directly.  If your mortgage company is outside of our regulatory authority, we will forward your concerns to the appropriate regulatory authority.



Please file your complaint on-line at our website: <http://www.nccob.org/>www.nccob.org



Go to our website, then click on the Consumer Assistance block.  Once on the Consumer Assistance page, you will find a link to our complaint form.  Fill out the form and submit it.  Print a copy of the completed form, sign it, and either fax or mail us the signed copy.  Once we have received the signature copy and any documentation pertinent to your complaint, we can contact the company on your behalf.



Please be aware that filing this complaint does not guarantee that your mortgage company can modify your loan or provide you with a workout plan.  What we can provide is making sure that your complaint gets to the right department within your mortgage company and is responded to with details of what options, if any, may be available to you at this time.



If you have further questions regarding filing a complaint, please contact our office.

Subject: FW: King, Susan (request for assistance)



I spoke with Susan King yesterday early afternoon, even before this e-mail came in to my office.  Susan told me then that she had written everyone that she could think of, including the Governor's office. 

Susan had left a voice mail for me early Monday morning, stating that one of the Clerk of Courts personnel has been giving Kevin King warnings about when Susan comes into the clerks office - in her words 'a heads-up on her activities'.  She also is still unhappy with the representation she is receiving from her attorney.

I called the Victim Advocate in the DA's office to ask her about the statement about the Clerk giving out inappropriate information.  I know that Janice deals with Criminal DV cases, but I wanted to speak with someone I knew at the courthouse to get their take on this statement that Susan was alleging.  Janice Loggins assured me that just because Mr.. King was a former law enforcement officer it did not give him preferential treatment.  Court papers are public information and anyone may ask to see documents regardless of their involvement in the case.  I asked Janice who the appropriate person would be, should Susan wish to lodge a complaint.  Ms. Loggins said that the process would be to begin with the attorney to take up for her, then followed by the Chief Clerk.

I called Susan King after this conversation, and she was waiting in her attorney's office.  I asked her if she had complained to Pisgah Legal Services about her attorney and she said she had, but that they were very slow in getting back to her.  Now her case is up this Thurs. the 9th.  She said they would not guarantee other representation and she had already paid Mr.. Smith to represent her.

She said her attorney had made no effort to get the papers from her case in Greenville, S.C. which she felt would be helpful to build her case here in Buncombe County.  So she requested the documents herself and they were forwarded to her.  She said in these documents, Kevin King says 'I have friends in the Clerks office who tell me everything'. 

As Susan was preparing to go into her attorney's office I told her to make sure that attorney see's those statements, as well as all the other documents she has obtained.  I also said that she could take the statements to the Chief Clerk, as this would be a personnel matter for the Clerks office.

This is the second time now that Ms. King has contacted all of our offices, right before her case is to be heard in court.  This leaves very little time to assist in any way, even though I do not know what this office might do to assist at this point.  We cannot provide an alternate attorney for her, and I cannot make a claim against the Clerks office as a third party.  Ms. King is very knowledgeable about how the system works, is quite capable of advocating for herself, and I believe is scared of the outcome of the court case - and the divorce settlement, understandably. 

Again, I encouraged her to follow-up with the Clerks office, and to let me know how her meeting with the attorney went.  I have not heard from her today. 

If you have other suggestions for action on this case, please let me know.

Ms. Hobbs:
Your e-mail has been forwarded to the NC Department of Correction. At this writing, no sentence restructuring laws have been passed.

Any change to North Carolina laws would require action by the North Carolina legislature.  Every year, many bills are introduced that never become law. You may want to check out the Web link: <http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/>http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/  At this site you can look up pending bills and also find out who represents your district.


Thank you for your inquiry.

Subject: Probation:

Comment: Governor Perdue: Are there any programs in place to help non-violent Felons get jobs.I was recently convicted of a Felony in VA due to the use of the internet in a State Police Sting operation.There was no victim 15-18 years old and no intention of going up there.All it was was the use of a cam and chat.My point is this I had 18 years in Civil Service with 2 left to retire @ 58 years of age.I am 57 now and it seems Ft. Bragg or I should say one of their tenants Womack Army Medical Center doesn't want to give me a hearing.According to the union AFGE the Hospital Staff and the Emergency Services Dept. where I worked as an EMT gave me 7 days to reply to a certified letter back on May 6th.I was still in Virginia waiting for the paperwork to get settled here in Fayetteville where I reside.One of the representatives said I was supposed to be given 30 days.I have been in a LWOP (Leave Without Pay) status since early September 2008.So basically I havn't had a Paycheck in @ 9-10 months.I have over 1000 of sick leave hours and 140 annual leave hours I can't touch under the curent circumstances.I have filed a grievance with the AFGE Union against Womack for not complying with the guidelines and to hear my story.All I am asking for them is to reinstate me somewhere else in Civil Service.I have bills to pay like everyone else and my wife can't do it alone.I have had to take 2 Finacial Hardship Withdrawals from my thrift Savings Plan just to pay some bills and our $1150.00 a month Mortgage.That TSP is supposed to be part of my retirement.I am not denying the fact I messed up on the computor but the fact remains I am a taxpayer and property owner and am being treated like a 2nd class citizen.Everyone should get a 2nd chance especially going 56 years with only 4 speeding tickets in 40 years of driving. P.S.If your office could shed some light on this I would appreciate it.My other point is this I have classes to take once a week and once a month with out of pocket expenses + gas.It seems North Carolina has all these laws and guidelines but nothing in place to help Felons get jobs.I am marketable and employable.I have more than a 12th grade education.Especially with 29 years in the Medicla/Fire/Rescue field.there has to be some position where someone will hire me. Thank you Richard Chandler

Ms. Coats,



The governor’s office forwarded your query to me for response.



42 Collision Center is on the leading edge of a very important movement.  You are to be commended and admired for being the first to take such an important step.



While there are tax credits for energy efficiency (e.g. installing insulation or high efficiency heating and cooling systems) and renewable energy systems (e.g. solar hot water) I am not aware of tax credit for “going green.”  There are however, a number of awards and recognitions for companies such as yours.



Several are listed below:

Comment: I am the Security Director for a Federal Credit Union and attempting to gain information on a parole suspect who is under current indictment, prior convictions, and continuing his financial crime spree. I am talking with Angela Winchester located in Guilford County Probation who states she cannot assist us by providing the suspects telephone number to us as a contact due to confidentialy laws. It is my understanding that this information is not priveleged once convicted and on probation. I am attempting to obtain more warrants for this suspect. Can you please tell me why this agency of the NC Probation office refuses to assist in a criminal investigation and is protecting the criminal? I would like some assistance to gain warrants for this career criminal.

Mr. Moose:

Thank you for reply and information which is of no use to me now.  I appreciate your quote of NCGS 15-207 which I was and am fully aware of and was only part of my initial complaint.  As explained to your Greensboro Probation Officer and her District Manager, I was seeking some assistance from a Government Agency empowered and authorized to exercise their law enforcement power over a known convicted felon and criminal who was actively on probation.  Information was provided on the initial conversation with Ms. Winchester that her probation subject was already convicted and was continuing his crime spree while visiting her on probation visits.  I cannot say that I was amazed or surprised to talk with her and her District Manager and learn of their outlook on crime and probation.  I was told that it would not do any good to revoke this person’s probation because the court would just turn him loose. (Quote)  I had a low opinion of your Department when I called for assistance and now have a confirmed low opinion.  It is you, your probation officers, managers, and your shared disrespect for citizens that allow such criminals as Jerry Johnson to walk the streets committing crimes while you turn your head and disregard their criminal behavior.  As long as you and your department condone the crimes that are being committed with your knowledge and assistance our judicial system will continue to fail.  I am not quite sure how many deaths, financial losses, and other crimes will occur before someone in a higher role than you will come to the aid of citizens of this state.  In closing Mr. Moose, I should not have to be a law enforcement officer, federal officer, or judicial official for you to provide assistance to me.  I would suggest that you go back and read the state constitution and your oath of office!  In closing, Jerry Johnson was located by Truliant Federal Credit Union Security, Interviewed by Truliant Federal Credit Union Security, provided a full confession admitting to larceny from a residence, fraud, forgery, and financial crimes.  Jerry Johnson’s information was turned over to the Greensboro Police Department who shares the same opinion that I do of your agency.

Subject: Probation Parole Suspect

Comment: I am the Security Director for a Federal Credit Union and attempting to gain information on a parole suspect who is under current indictment, prior convictions, and continuing his financial crime spree. I am talking with Angela Winchester located in Guilford County Probation who states she cannot assist us by providing the suspects telephone number to us as a contact due to confidentialy laws. It is my understanding that this information is not priveleged once convicted and on probation. I am attempting to obtain more warrants for this suspect. Can you please tell me why this agency of the NC Probation office refuses to assist in a criminal investigation and is protecting the criminal? I would like some assistance to gain warrants for this career criminal.

Thank you for your recent inquiry to the Governor’s Office.  They have asked that I respond.  I am glad to address the question of where the lottery funds have gone.



Through yesterday, sales to date have been over $ 3.5 billion.   We make transfers to the Office of State Budget and Management quarterly.  Our last transfer was made July 1 and was based on sales through the end of June.  We have transferred over $1.136 billion to North Carolina. Once we transfer funds, our responsibility for the funds is complete.



The Lottery Act specifies how the lottery proceeds will be spent.  The Act designates that 50% is to be split between at-risk four-year old pre-K and K-3 class size reduction; 40% to school construction; and 10% to college scholarships.  The class size dollars are the only lottery funds designated to cover teacher salaries. It takes an act of the Governor or the Legislature to alter this designation.  The following hot links list the lottery allocations by county for fiscal years 07 and 08:  <http://www.nc-educationlottery.org/uploads/docs/Beneficiary%20Brochure%20fy2008.pdf>FY '08 Beneficiary Brochure   <http://www.nc-educationlottery.org/uploads/docs/Beneficiary%20Brochure%20fy2007.pdf>FY '07 Beneficiary Brochure.  The FY09 brochure will be prepared after the fiscal year ends.  These brochures don’t show what the counties have received this year because we don’t have that information yet. You can find more information on the lottery webpage at <http://www.nc-educationlottery.org/about_where-the-money-goes.aspx>http://www.nc-educationlottery.org/about_where-the-money-goes.aspx.



The education lottery has accomplished what the Legislature envisioned when it was created.  The money is going where directed by law.  The lottery was never designed to meet all the budget needs of education.  We cover roughly 4% of the education budget.  The education budget is greater than 50% of the total state budget.  The K-12 annual budget is over $8 billion.  Education funding needs are significant.  At the lottery, we are extremely pleased that we have added over $1 billion that was not previously available.  The Governor is trying to fill a one-year $3 billion hole in the budget.  Without the lottery, that hole would be bigger.



Getting the word out about where the money has gone has proven difficult.  We appreciate the interest of citizens such as you and are glad to be able to provide this information

You have got to be kidding. Raising the sales tax, calling for “tax cuts” then asking for more school spending?  What was the ram rod lottery vote about?  Where is the money?
