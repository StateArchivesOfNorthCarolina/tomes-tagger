Like most of my fellow North Carolinians, I believe life should mean life, and even if a life sentence is defined as 80 years, getting out after only 35 is simply unacceptable.

> Since that ruling, my staff and I have been doing everything we can to stop the release of these rapists and murderers. These are people who have been denied parole repeatedly, and many who have numerous infractions during their prison stay. I do not believe they are ready for release onto the streets of our communities.

> While I understand the decision of the Supreme Court, I believe there remain unresolved legal issues that were not addressed. Before Mr. Bowden or any other offender affected by the Courtís decision is turned loose, these issues must be heard.

> At issue is the application of good behavior credits to these violent offenders serving life sentences since the 1970s. Since last week, we have been scrutinizing the good behavior credits applied to the 20 inmates eligible for immediate release. This morning, legal counsel and Department of Correction staff met with officials who oversaw the application of those behavior credits during the 1980s. At the time, the DOC gave inmates day-for-day credits under the authority of the then-secretary. There is a real question whether the General Assembly intended for the DOC to have that kind of authority. I do not believe they did, and my legal counsel agrees. This raises the very real question that these inmates should not be eligible for early release.

> Mr. Bowdenís case is in the process of being sent back to the trial court to recalculate his sentence. These issues can be resolved by the courts.

> Until these new legal issues have been resolved by the courts, Mr. Bowden and the other violent offenders will not be released.

Subject: thank you for helping protect the women & children of NC

Comment: Ma'am, I wanted to thank you for blocking the release of the convicted murderers/rapists that was recently being contemplated. When I first heard that might happen, and reviewed the charges of the inmates involved, my first thought was, "Does no one care about the women and children of this State?" How could law enforcement turns their backs on us like that?? Thank you for stepping up to the plate and protecting the women and children of your State. I am thankful you had the strength and courage to do so. I am sure many other rape survivors feel the same way I do. In gratitude and appreciation, Pam Marx Raleigh, NC

Words just can't express how thankful I am.† I teared up a bit when i heard the news.

Dear Govenor Perdue,

I want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for not releasing the murderer that killed my grandmother, Norma Ehrhart.† She was killed in 1975 at a local 7-11 in Fayetteville, North Carolina.† My mother was pregnant with me during that time so I did not have the chance to meet her.† To this day, I wonder what it would of been like to have my grandmother in my life.† So again, thank you and God bless.

I wanted to let you know that I am so glad that you are doing everything you can to keep these people behind bars.† One of the victims of Bobby Bowden was my best friends mother.†

My in-laws were killed in a car wreck 10 yrs ago caused by a "released" criminal.† He was drinking at the time, but since he was not caught until the next night, that could not be proved.† He only spent 7 yrs in prison for causing 2 deaths of the most wonderful people I ever knew.† Ever since then, I have my doubts about the "just" in justice system and this so-called structured sentencing in N.C.† I have lived here since 1977 and for the first time voted last year.† Unless something changes, I will vote for "you" again.
THANKS AGAIN

> Gov. Perdue Establishes the NC Innovation Council

Gov. Perdue†on Monday†announced the creation of the first North Carolina Innovation Council.† The purpose of the Council is to foster strategic investments and policies in the growing knowledge and innovation economy.† Perdue made the announcement after touring a lab in the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in Winston-Salem.
> †
> ‚ÄúTo continue growing jobs in North Carolina we must make sure this state is poised to compete globally in the 21st century,‚Äù said Perdue.† ‚ÄúInnovation is North Carolina‚Äôs launch pad to success in the global economy, and it‚Äôs a primary way for us to maintain and sharpen our competitive edge.‚Äù
Executive Order No. 29 establishes the North Carolina Innovation Council and empowers it to advise the Governor on:
‚Ä¢ coordinating public and private investments and policies to promote innovation;
> ‚Ä¢ moving innovative ideas from the lab to the marketplace more efficiently; and
> ‚Ä¢ strengthening collaboration among business, academia, state and local government.
The Council‚Äôs membership will draw on a broad spectrum of expertise in entrepreneurship, science, academia and government. It will be co-chaired by Steve Nelson, managing partner of the Wakefield Group, and Al Delia, senior advisor to the Governor.

Gov. Perdue, Microsoft Unveil New Partnership to Offer Job Training

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Thursday†announced that North Carolina will join forces with Microsoft in an innovative, public-private partnership to provide free technology training to individuals across the state. The Governor joined Gail Thomas Flynn, Microsoft‚Äôs Vice President of State and Local Government, at the Harris Campus of Central Piedmont Community College to applaud the unique partnership titled ‚ÄúMicrosoft Elevate America.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis partnership will provide North Carolinians with another opportunity to retrain for today‚Äôs new economy,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said. ‚ÄúAt a time when businesses are seeking a highly qualified, well trained workforce, Elevate America can provide potential employees with new skills to succeed.‚Äù
Microsoft is partnering with the North Carolina Community College System, the Division of Workforce Development in the N.C. Department of Commerce and the N.C. Employment Security Commission to distribute a total of 23,700 training vouchers during the next 90 days across the state. Courses range from basic technology literacy to intermediate-level technology skills. A portion of the vouchers will be issued to North Carolina residents for Microsoft Certification Exams, all at no cost to the recipients.
For additional information regarding the Microsoft vouchers and locations where citizens can obtain a voucher in North Carolina, visit <https://secure.ncjoblinkmis.com/>https://secure.ncjoblinkmis.com/ and click on the Microsoft Elevate America link.††

Affidavit Filed to Prevent Prisoner Release Without Parole

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Thursday†announced that the Department of Correction is putting in place a plan to comply with the decisions of the appellate courts in the State v. Bowden case.† The Department has calculated unconditional release dates for the affected inmates.† According to these calculations, the earliest unconditional release date is scheduled for 2054.
‚ÄúI will continue to pursue all legal means of preventing the release of these inmates without any review by the parole board or any post-release supervision,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue.† ‚ÄúI have asked Sec. Keller to review all records to ensure that the inmates are not awarded any credits for which they are not eligible.‚Äù
Pursuant to the court decision, DOC has calculated unconditional release dates for those prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes committed between April 8, 1974 and June 30, 1978.† For this group of offenders, records had previously shown release dates of ‚ÄúLIFE,‚Äù reflecting that no unconditional release was thought to be available to them.† These sentences must now be treated as statutory life sentences of 80 years.
DOC Secretary Alvin Keller has directed that for each life sentence imposed for crimes during this time period, the unconditional release date shall be calculated as 80 years minus applicable jail credit earned while the prisoner awaited conviction and sentencing.
As has been the practice of the DOC for at least 50 years, Secretary Keller will continue awarding good behavior credits for prisoners with life sentences only for purposes of earning a more favorable custody grade, for becoming eligible for parole or when the Governor commutes a prisoner‚Äôs sentence.† Such credits will not be awarded for purposes of calculating an unconditional release date.† This has been the procedure of the Department of Correction since at least 1955, during which time the head of the corrections agency has held statutory authority to establish rules and regulations as to grades of prisoners, rewards and privileges applicable to the classification of prisoners and allowances of time for good behavior.
The Fair Sentencing Act passed in 1981 excluded Class A and B felons from receiving good behavior credits for purposes of unconditional release from prison [15A-1340.1 (a)].
‚ÄúI cannot see any meaningful difference between prisoners with statutory life sentences of 80 years and Class A and B felons under the Fair Sentencing Act in that their crimes are similarly heinous,‚Äù said Keller.
The DOC has filed an affidavit from Secretary Keller explaining this release date calculation in Cleveland Superior Court for the State v. Wilbur William Folston case. Similar affidavits will be filed in the Bowden case and others where judges have ordered release dates to be calculated for similarly situated inmates.

Gov. Perdue Launches eLearningNC.gov

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Monday announced the launch of <http://elearningnc.gov/>eLearningNC.gov, the entry point to all the eLearning resources North Carolina has to offer.† The new web site will provide an easy one-stop-shop for any North Carolinian, from K-12 students to life-long learners, who wants to take advantage of online learning such as the NC Virtual Public School, online courses from community colleges or universities, and online career building.
†‚ÄúOver the last 10 years, technology has revolutionized the way we live and work ‚Äì and I‚Äôm committed to using it to revolutionize the way we teach and learn,‚Äù said Perdue.† ‚ÄúWith the click of a mouse, anyone in North Carolina will be able to access online learning through this new web site.† A highly-educated workforce, highly-proficient in technology, is key to keeping North Carolina competitive in the high-tech global economy.‚Äù
<http://elearningnc.gov/>eLearningNC.gov was created by a partnership between the Office of the Governor, the North Carolina Education Cabinet, and the North Carolina eLearning Commission.
eLearning provides all K-12 students, regardless of location or background, with the ability to take online courses that would normally not be available to them.† Additionally, eLearning provides all college students and adults with the opportunity to take courses and learn new skills through retraining or advanced degrees.

Perdue Announces Investments in†Green Economy

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Wednesday announced that 18 small North Carolina companies will receive grants up to $100,000 to develop and market promising green and alternative energy technologies and products.† It is the third round of grants distributed by the state Department of Commerce‚Äôs Green Business Fund and puts more than $1 million in federal Recovery Act dollars to work in North Carolina.
‚ÄúNorth Carolina continues to position itself as a leader in the emerging green economy with these kinds of smart investments in promising technologies and products,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue.† ‚ÄúThese creative entrepreneurs and businesses are turning green into gold by growing new companies and creating jobs.‚Äù
It is estimated that more than 200 private sector jobs will be created as a result of the grants, spread across 18 cities and spanning 18 counties in North Carolina.† The federal Recovery dollars come through the N.C. Energy Office‚Äôs State Energy Program.
About half the projects fell under the ‚Äúenvironmentally conscious clean technology and renewable energy‚Äù category while the remainder fell under the green building and biofuels categories.† The awards ranged in amounts from - $31,985 to $100,000.

Gov. Perdue Requests Disaster Assistance for Haywood County Businesses Affected by Rockslide Closure

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Tuesday†requested assistance from the federal government for businesses affected by the closure of I-40 due to the rockslide of Oct. 25. In asking for a U.S. Small Business Administration disaster declaration, Gov. Perdue sought funding to help businesses in Haywood County cover normal operating expenses. If approved, the declaration will make low-interest loans available to help eligible business owners pay expenses until the interstate reopens. Also eligible will be Buncombe, Henderson, Jackson, Swain and Transylvania counties.
‚ÄúInterstate 40 is a major commercial route through western North Carolina and many local businesses depend upon that traffic for their livelihood,‚Äù Perdue said. ‚ÄúThese federal loans would offer needed assistance to businesses that have been impacted since the rockslide.‚Äù
Several business owners have asked the state for financial assistance after they experienced a dramatic decrease in business activity over the past three weeks. An SBA disaster declaration for economic injury would enable business owners to apply for low interest loans to pay for repairs and loss of revenue.† If the request is approved, business owners will be advised of the process for applying for loans.

Gov. Perdue Makes Emergency Declaration for Dare County

Gov. Bev Perdue†on†Monday signed an emergency declaration to help Dare County recover from the heavy rain and flooding that saturated the area last week as Tropical Storm Ida moved through North Carolina. The declaration of a State of Emergency is the first step in seeking federal funds to help clear debris and repair N.C. 12, as it enables the N.C. Department of Transportation to request funding assistance from the Federal Highway Administration.
‚ÄúOur local and state emergency management and transportation officials have worked tirelessly since the storm rolled in last week,‚Äù Perdue said. ‚ÄúCrews are working as quickly as possible to reopen the road and coming up with alternative emergency routes in the meantime. With the tremendous amounts of rain that soaked our entire state and the high winds, we‚Äôre extremely fortunate that there was not more damage.‚Äù
Gov. Perdue toured portions of Dare County and the Outer Banks on Tuesday and met with local emergency and transportation officials.

Job Announcements in McDowell and Richmond Counties

North Cove Springs, a regional producer of bottled water from natural springs, will expand its production facility in McDowell County.† The company will invest more than $6.3 million and create 138 jobs in Marion.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $310,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
‚ÄúNorth Carolina‚Äôs business-friendly policies and highly skilled workforce remain attractive to growing companies looking for the ideal location to expand,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said.† ‚ÄúOur state is the perfect platform for successful firms like this one to compete and thrive in a national market.‚Äù
North Cove Springs, of Marion, whose ownership includes Able Rebuilders LLC, a national tools remanufacturer headquartered in Florida, taps water from natural springs.† North Cove bottles, markets and distributes the spring water and naturally flavored water beverages to regional and national retailers.

Happy Thanksgiving!

I wish you and your family many blessings and†a very happy Thanksgiving weekend!† Please travel safely and eat well.† I will be with my†family this weekend, and giving thanks for my many blessings. But I will also take a moment to remember†those I've met†recently who are less fortunate.†

On Monday, I helped deliver the four millionth meal for the Winston-Salem Meals-on-Wheels program.† After I delivered her meal, Ms. Nancy Hooper told me how thankful she is for the volunteers.† Itís more than just†a warm†meal those dedicated North Carolinians bring ó it's a smiling face, a friendly conversation, a little bit of humanity. That can make all the difference.†

On Tuesday, I spent some time at the Raleigh Rescue Mission.† I spoke with many of the people there†ó†some were recovering from addiction and others were unlucky families who are homeless for the holidays.† At the children's development center, I listened to pre-schoolers of homeless mothers.† Despite their situation, they were all able to list something they were thankful for ó and there's nothing like the sincerity of a child to brighten your day and give you hope for the future.

Please count your blessings and give thanks this weekend. Remember your friends and†neighbors who may be struggling this year;†it's a rough time for many North Carolina families, but together, we will get through this. Let's all take inspiration and hope from stories like those from Meals on Wheels and the Rescue Mission ó we all have something to be thankful for.

Experts laud North Carolina's finances

Every state has been hit hard by the global economic crisis.† State budgets across the country have seen record shortfalls and deficits.† But not many states have dealt with these financial hardships as well as North Carolina.† Experts have lauded North Carolinaís budget management.

Last month, the stateís AAA bond rating was reaffirmed by the three rating agencies.† North Carolina was one of only seven states to get the AAA bond rating from all three agencies.† The other states were Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Georgia, Missouri and Utah.

In particular, Moodyís emphasized the stateís proactive budget management: ìMoodyís believes that the stateís strong executive management and proactive responses to its unexpected budget shortfalls will enable North Carolina to manage ongoing fiscal pressures.î

Additionally, a recent <http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/>Pew Center on the States study of states in fiscal peril put North Carolina in†the top 20 of states in the best financial condition.

Gov. Perdue Announces Haywood County Businesses to Receive Disaster Aid

Gov.†Perdue†on Tuesday†announced the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has agreed to provide low-interest government loans to help eligible Haywood County businesses cover normal operating expenses. Several business owners asked the state for financial assistance after they experienced a dramatic decrease in business activity over the past three weeks.

ìThese federal loans are critical to protect western North Carolina businesses and the families that rely on them for their livelihood,î said Perdue.† ìI encourage eligible businesses that need extra help to take advantage of this opportunity.î

A major rockslide near the Tennessee border on Oct. 25 has shut down Interstate 40 while crews work to remove the debris and repair the road. Traffic has been rerouted along Interstates 26 and 81.

The SBAís Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program provides loans to help business owners pay bills when their businesses are not producing income. The EIDL is available even if the business didnít suffer physical damage; loans are available only to applicants determined by SBA to have no credit available elsewhere. All Economic Injury Disaster Loans are made at the four percent interest rate with terms up to 30 years. Small businesses may borrow up to $2 million, but specific amounts and terms are set by the SBA based on each applicantís financial condition.

Several businesses were significantly impacted by the rock-slide detour.† The SBA declared Haywood County a disaster area as a result of the rock slide.† Under SBA rules, businesses in Buncombe, Henderson, Jackson, Madison, Swain and Transylvania counties that also suffered economic losses as a result of the damaged highway also may be eligible for assistance.

Governor Speeds Up Unemployment Benefits for ConAgra Workers

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Tuesday†signed Executive Order No. 31 to extend immediate eligibility for unemployment benefits to laid-off ConAgra Foods employees.† State law permits the Governor to waive the ìwaiting weekî for unemployment benefits for the victims of a major industrial disaster.

ìAlready in the midst of tough economic times, the ConAgra disaster was a major blow to hundreds of North Carolina families,î said Perdue.† ìSpeeding up unemployment benefits will help these families get back on their feet faster.î

On June 9, 2009 an explosion occurred at ConAgraís Slim Jim plant in Garner.† The explosion has claimed the lives of four workers and injured dozens more.† ConAgra has resumed limited production at the facilityówell below its capacity.† ConAgra ended compensation for some of its employees last week.

8 Contracts Totaling $21.3 Million Awarded for Highway Projects Across North Carolina

Gov. Bev Perdue announced on Monday†that eight contracts totaling $21.3 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including four projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The contracts were awarded by the N.C. Department of Transportation to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.

ìRecovery dollars continue to help us put North Carolinians to work and deliver much-needed†transportation projects,î Perdue said.

The four recovery projects are located in Alleghany, Halifax, Rockingham and Wilson counties.†† The six other projects are located in Brunswick, Duplin, New Hanover, Onslow, Pender, Sampson and Wake counties.

Two other projects, one for the Daniel Street Extension in Edgecombe County and one for a bridge replacement in Forsyth County, will be awarded if the low bidder demonstrates that it has met ìgood faith effortî requirements in attempting to reach the disadvantaged business enterprise goals set forth in the contracts.

The bids received on all 10 projects advertised came in 9.8 percent, or about $4.1 million, below NCDOT estimates.† For more information about funding for infrastructure improvements in North Carolina, as well as other NCDOT projects and activities, visit <http://www.ncdot.gov>www.ncdot.gov.

Gov. Perdue Requests Federal Disaster Declaration for Dare County

Gov. Perdue†on Wednesday†requested assistance from the federal government for homeowners and businesses in Dare County affected by the recent nor'easter. In asking for a U.S. Small Business Administration disaster declaration, Gov. Perdue sought funding to help homeowners and businesses in Dare County that sustained major damages from the recent storm.† If approved, the declaration will make low-interest loans available to help eligible property owners make repairs.† Also eligible will be Currituck, Hyde and Tyrrell counties.

ìThese federal loans will offer needed assistance to coastal residents to rebuild their homes and businesses,î said Perdue.† ìI saw the damage in Dare County first-hand and itís important that we get everyone back on their feet quickly.î

Between November 10 and 15, a noríeaster related to the remnants of Hurricane Ida swept through coastal North Carolina.† The most severe damage was found in Dare County.† A damage assessment survey found several homes and business having sustained major damage as a result of the storm.†

An SBA disaster declaration would enable eligible citizens to apply for low interest home and personal property loans to pay for repairs and loss of inventory or other business capital.† If the request is approved, citizens will be advised of the process for applying for loans.

Comment: Govenor Purdue: thank you for keeping the convicts in prison. If our Judicial System would have done the same in 2008 as you have Eve Carson and Abhijit Mahato would be alive. They had everything to offer and those swamp running trash did nothing but take and destroy! Please back the 2nd amendment because our law enforcement has become the victims and the prey as evident by Maurice Clemmons, his friends and relatives. Once again thank you: Patrick Kenneth O'Brien
