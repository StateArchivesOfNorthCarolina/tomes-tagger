Governor Perdue Announces FY 2009-2011 Budget

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday†announced her 2009-2011 proposed budget.† Despite facing the most challenging budget situation in decades, her budget increases per-pupil spending, invests in job creation and protects public safety through probation, mental health and anti-gang initiatives.

"As families and businesses across our state are tightening their belts to make ends meet, government must do the same.† But, in the process, we must not neglect the stateís most pressing needs," Gov. Perdue said.† "My proposed biennial budget makes strategic investments to create jobs and increases overall per student spending, while ensuring that North Carolina state government lives within its means."

Gov. Perdueís budget closes a $6.4 billion cumulative gap and reduces spending by $2.6 billion over the next two years.† Her budget also utilizes $2.9 billion of federal recovery funds to support critical services and recommends a $1.3 billion revenue change for tobacco products and alcohol.

Gov. Perdue stresses recurring savings rather than one-time actions, asks agency heads to take a targeted approach to identify reductions, and eliminates or reduces 20 programs that are inefficient, duplicative or costly.

Governor Perdue Opens Piedmont Office in Charlotte

ìI have pledged to be a governor who represents all people, in all parts of North Carolina,î said Perdue. ìOur state has governorsí offices in the west and in the east. It is important we have an office that is accessible to the residents of this region as well.î

The office is in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Government Center, in uptown Charlotte. It will be staffed full-time by the director of the piedmont office.

Perdue was joined by Lt. Gov. Walter Dalton, Commerce Secretary Keith Crisco, local elected officials and area business leaders at the office opening.

The office phone number is (704) 330-5290.


$48.85 Million in Neighborhood Stabilization Grants Announced

Wednesday, Gov. Bev Perdue announced that 20 local governments, nonprofits and other organizations have received grant awards totaling $48.85 million under the new federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program developed late last year by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The programís purpose is to assist those areas hit hardest by the housing crisis.

ìForeclosures, subprime mortgages and mortgage defaults are hurting homeowners, families and our communities,î Perdue said. ìThese new federal funds will go to communities most severely affected by the housing crisis and will be used effectively. Iím encouraging all participating organizations to collaborate in order to leverage these grant funds and make them go even further.î

Local Government Recipients: City of Raleigh, $2.5 million; Wake County, $2.5 million; City of Charlotte, $2.5 million; City of Greensboro, $2.5 million; City of Winston-Salem, $2.5 million; City of High Point, $2.5 million; City of Gastonia, $2 million; Henderson/Vance County, $2 million; City of Durham, $2 million; City of Rocky Mount, $2 million; City of Lexington, $2 million.

Non-profit Agency Recipients: St. Augustine, in Raleigh, $2 million; Charlotte Housing Authority,† $2 million; Guilford Habitat for Humanity, $2 million; Forsyth Habitat for Humanity, $2 million; Passage Home (in Wake County), $2 million; Greensboro Housing Authority, $2 million.

Statewide Agency/intermediary Recipients: Self-Help Credit Union, $2.5 million; N.C. Community Development Initiative, $3.5 million; and N.C. Housing Finance Agency, $4 million.

NSP funding is provided through HUDís Community Development Block Grant program under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. In North Carolina, the NSP grants are administered by the Commerce Departmentís Division of Community Assistance. DCA staff developed North Carolinaís guidelines through a public process late last year. Total NSP grant funding to North Carolina is $52.1 million; 5 percent of that will be used by DCA to implement and monitor the program.


Governor Proposes Legislation to Increase State Mental Health Facility Transparency

Wednesday,†Bev Perdue announced that she will work with Attorney General Roy Cooper and proposed legislation to increase the transparency of state mental health, developmental disability and substance abuse facilities by making more information in death records public.

ìIn North Carolina, the welfare of our citizens always comes first,î said Gov. Perdue. ìEnsuring that important information in death records is public will make state facilities more accountable for the people in their care, restore public confidence and rebuild public trust.î

Perdue and Cooperís proposal would require the following information regarding deaths in state facilities to be public information:

- The name, sex, age and date of birth of the deceased;
> - The name of the facility providing the report;
> - The date, time and location of the death;
> - A brief description of the circumstances of death, including the manner of death if known; and
> - A list of all entities to whom the event was reported.

Budget Reform and Accountability Commission

Last week, Gov. Bev Perdue† announced that Hilda Pinnix-Ragland of Cary and Norris Tolson of Pinetops will serve as co-chairs of the Budget Reform and Accountability Commission (BRAC). Perdue established the commission to help her locate and eliminate wasteful spending while increasing efficiency in government.

ìIt is the responsibility of government to ensure every tax dollar is used as efficiently and wisely as possible,î said Perdue. ìI expect my BRAC team to root out wasteful and unnecessary spending, hold government accountable for its appropriations and help ensure taxpayers are not funding ineffective or unsuccessful programs.î

The commissionís first task will be to conduct a detailed review of the stateís entire continuation budget to identify inefficiencies, and develop options for cuts and consolidations.

The initial membership of the BRAC is expected to be named within the next week.

Dear Governor Perdue,

About one week ago I sent an e-mail to your office in Raleigh and have not had a reply. I asked for information about two bills that apparently†are in the General Assembly and deal with chiropractors.

Is there a chance that someone can reply to me? I†would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you,

Governor Perdue Announces FY 2009-2011 Budget
Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday announced her 2009-2011 proposed budget.  Despite facing the most challenging budget situation in decades, her budget increases per-pupil spending, invests in job creation and protects public safety through probation, mental health and anti-gang initiatives.

"As families and businesses across our state are tightening their belts to make ends meet, government must do the same.  But, in the process, we must not neglect the state's most pressing needs," Gov. Perdue said.  "My proposed biennial budget makes strategic investments to create jobs and increases overall per student spending, while ensuring that North Carolina state government lives within its means."

Gov. Perdue's budget closes a $6.4 billion cumulative gap and reduces spending by $2.6 billion over the next two years.  Her budget also utilizes $2.9 billion of federal recovery funds to support critical services and recommends a $1.3 billion revenue change for tobacco products and alcohol.

Gov. Perdue stresses recurring savings rather than one-time actions, asks agency heads to take a targeted approach to identify reductions, and eliminates or reduces 20 programs that are inefficient, duplicative or costly.

Governor Perdue Opens Piedmont Office in Charlotte
Today Gov. Perdue announced the official opening of the Governor's Piedmont Office in Charlotte, fulfilling a campaign pledge.

"I have pledged to be a governor who represents all people, in all parts of North Carolina," said Perdue. "Our state has governors' offices in the west and in the east. It is important we have an office that is accessible to the residents of this region as well."

The office is in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Government Center, in uptown Charlotte. It will be staffed full-time by the director of the piedmont office.

Perdue was joined by Lt. Gov. Walter Dalton, Commerce Secretary Keith Crisco, local elected officials and area business leaders at the office opening.

The office phone number is (704) 330-5290.

$48.85 Million in Neighborhood Stabilization Grants Announced
Wednesday, Gov. Bev Perdue announced that 20 local governments, nonprofits and other organizations have received grant awards totaling $48.85 million under the new federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program developed late last year by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The program's purpose is to assist those areas hit hardest by the housing crisis.

"Foreclosures, subprime mortgages and mortgage defaults are hurting homeowners, families and our communities," Perdue said. "These new federal funds will go to communities most severely affected by the housing crisis and will be used effectively. I'm encouraging all participating organizations to collaborate in order to leverage these grant funds and make them go even further."

Local Government Recipients: City of Raleigh, $2.5 million; Wake County, $2.5 million; City of Charlotte, $2.5 million; City of Greensboro, $2.5 million; City of Winston-Salem, $2.5 million; City of High Point, $2.5 million; City of Gastonia, $2 million; Henderson/Vance County, $2 million; City of Durham, $2 million; City of Rocky Mount, $2 million; City of Lexington, $2 million.

Non-profit Agency Recipients: St. Augustine, in Raleigh, $2 million; Charlotte Housing Authority,  $2 million; Guilford Habitat for Humanity, $2 million; Forsyth Habitat for Humanity, $2 million; Passage Home (in Wake County), $2 million; Greensboro Housing Authority, $2 million.

Statewide Agency/intermediary Recipients: Self-Help Credit Union, $2.5 million; N.C. Community Development Initiative, $3.5 million; and N.C. Housing Finance Agency, $4 million.

NSP funding is provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant program under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. In North Carolina, the NSP grants are administered by the Commerce Department's Division of Community Assistance. DCA staff developed North Carolina's guidelines through a public process late last year. Total NSP grant funding to North Carolina is $52.1 million; 5 percent of that will be used by DCA to implement and monitor the program.

Governor Proposes Legislation to Increase State Mental Health Facility Transparency
Wednesday, Bev Perdue announced that she will work with Attorney General Roy Cooper and proposed legislation to increase the transparency of state mental health, developmental disability and substance abuse facilities by making more information in death records public.

"In North Carolina, the welfare of our citizens always comes first," said Gov. Perdue. "Ensuring that important information in death records is public will make state facilities more accountable for the people in their care, restore public confidence and rebuild public trust."

Perdue and Cooper's proposal would require the following information regarding deaths in state facilities to be public information:

- The name, sex, age and date of birth of the deceased;
- The name of the facility providing the report;
- The date, time and location of the death;
- A brief description of the circumstances of death, including the manner of death if known; and
- A list of all entities to whom the event was reported.

Budget Reform and Accountability Commission
Last week, Gov. Bev Perdue  announced that Hilda Pinnix-Ragland of Cary and Norris Tolson of Pinetops will serve as co-chairs of the Budget Reform and Accountability Commission (BRAC). Perdue established the commission to help her locate and eliminate wasteful spending while increasing efficiency in government.

"It is the responsibility of government to ensure every tax dollar is used as efficiently and wisely as possible," said Perdue. "I expect my BRAC team to root out wasteful and unnecessary spending, hold government accountable for its appropriations and help ensure taxpayers are not funding ineffective or unsuccessful programs."

The commission's first task will be to conduct a detailed review of the state's entire continuation budget to identify inefficiencies, and develop options for cuts and consolidations.

The initial membership of the BRAC is expected to be named within the next week.

Please ask the governor how raising taxes on cigs etc is helping the people.† People cannot afford to pay their bills as it is.† Increasing taxes just puts us more behind on these items.† I use tobacco products and i am not ashamed of it.† Politians just make promises and never goes by what they say.† They should develop the slogan as one pro wrestler has, "lie,cheat and steal."† I am disappointed in Bev.

She opens another office.† Another way of spending tax payers money in a time when we cannot afford it.† She gives a job to a man over June Atkinson, another govt waste of money, because June is doing a wonderful job.

Creating more burdens on the tax payer.† I should have known better.† I should have stayed a republician and never switched parties.† Another demo will never get my vote.

NAB EDUCATION FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES
SERVICE TO AMERICA AWARD WINNERS†

WASHINGTON, DC - NABEF announced today the winners of the 11th annual Service to America Awards. Winners will be honored at the Celebration of Service to America Awards dinner on Monday, June 8 at the Renaissance Washington, DC Hotel. The celebration recognizes outstanding community service by local broadcasters.†

"This year's group of winners has done an outstanding job at developing programs and initiatives designed to improve their respective communities," said NAB President and CEO David K. Rehr. "The dedication these broadcasters have shown toward their viewers and listeners is truly remarkable, and we look forward to honoring their efforts during the 2009 Celebration of Service to America Awards dinner."†

This year's Service to America Awards will honor the following broadcasters:†

Service to America Television Award
This award recognizes a television station for the totality of its efforts and its commitment to excellence in serving its community.†

WFMY-TV Greensboro, NC
Owner: Gannett Broadcasting†

WFMY has a history of reaching out to the local community and providing answers to tough questions such as how to feed the hungry or how to improve the education system. The station's outreach keeps viewers informed about those in need and gets them involved in being part of the solution. Efforts include Operation Greensboro Cares, the annual Food 2 Families campaign (now in its 17th year), Tools for School (which helped more than 19,000 students in 15 school systems in 2008), free swimming classes for needy children and Go Healthy Month to educate children about healthy lifestyles.†

These awards spotlight television and radio stations for outstanding programs, campaigns and public service announcements produced for the benefit of children.†

Radio
WLEN-FM Adrian, MI

Every day WLEN serves children of all ages in their community. The station sponsors a number of events and initiatives for children, including public service campaigns produced by youth groups and student interns, and broadcasts highlighting the "Student of the Day" and the "Athlete of the Week." WLEN also involves the youth of their community in helping others. With Mission Possible, youth groups helped raise money to provide shelter for homeless men in the community.††

Television

I like the idea of furloughs.  I would not be self conscious about  
the perception of bad financial state caused by this approach, since  
everyone is in a similar boat.  Plus is has the major advantage of  
FAIRNESS.  Everyone suffers a little to save some from suffering a  
lot.  Much better.

Thanks!

I don't think too many people who honestly care about what our kids are breathing in WNC are too happy with Gov. Perdue right now.† The truth?† There isn't a single leader in NC who has the courage to lead where we have to go in the face of the global warming tsunami facing us.

Governor Perdue Announces FY 2009-2011 Budget

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday†announced her 2009-2011 proposed budget.† Despite facing the most challenging budget situation in decades, her budget increases per-pupil spending, invests in job creation and protects public safety through probation, mental health and anti-gang initiatives.

"As families and businesses across our state are tightening their belts to make ends meet, government must do the same.† But, in the process, we must not neglect the state‚Äôs most pressing needs," Gov. Perdue said.† "My proposed biennial budget makes strategic investments to create jobs and increases overall per student spending, while ensuring that North Carolina state government lives within its means."

Gov. Perdue‚Äôs budget closes a $6.4 billion cumulative gap and reduces spending by $2.6 billion over the next two years.† Her budget also utilizes $2.9 billion of federal recovery funds to support critical services and recommends a $1.3 billion revenue change for tobacco products and alcohol.

Gov. Perdue stresses recurring savings rather than one-time actions, asks agency heads to take a targeted approach to identify reductions, and eliminates or reduces 20 programs that are inefficient, duplicative or costly.

The program‚Äôs purpose is to assist those areas hit hardest by the housing crisis.

‚ÄúForeclosures, subprime mortgages and mortgage defaults are hurting homeowners, families and our communities,‚Äù Perdue said. ‚ÄúThese new federal funds will go to communities most severely affected by the housing crisis and will be used effectively. I‚Äôm encouraging all participating organizations to collaborate in order to leverage these grant funds and make them go even further.‚Äù

Local Government Recipients: City of Raleigh, $2.5 million; Wake County, $2.5 million; City of Charlotte, $2.5 million; City of Greensboro, $2.5 million; City of Winston-Salem, $2.5 million; City of High Point, $2.5 million; City of Gastonia, $2 million; Henderson/Vance County, $2 million; City of Durham, $2 million; City of Rocky Mount, $2 million; City of Lexington, $2 million.

Governor Proposes Legislation to Increase State Mental Health Facility Transparency

Wednesday,†Bev Perdue announced that she will work with Attorney General Roy Cooper and proposed legislation to increase the transparency of state mental health, developmental disability and substance abuse facilities by making more information in death records public.

‚ÄúIn North Carolina, the welfare of our citizens always comes first,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúEnsuring that important information in death records is public will make state facilities more accountable for the people in their care, restore public confidence and rebuild public trust.‚Äù

- The name, sex, age and date of birth of the deceased;
> - The name of the facility providing the report;
> - The date, time and location of the death;
> - A brief description of the circumstances of death, including the manner of death if known; and

The commission‚Äôs first task will be to conduct a detailed review of the state‚Äôs entire continuation budget to identify inefficiencies, and develop options for cuts and consolidations.

The initial membership of the BRAC is expected to be named within the next week.

Governor Perdue Announces FY 2009-2011 Budget

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday†announced her 2009-2011 proposed budget.† Despite facing the most challenging budget situation in decades, her budget increases per-pupil spending, invests in job creation and protects public safety through probation, mental health and anti-gang initiatives.

"As families and businesses across our state are tightening their belts to make ends meet, government must do the same.† But, in the process, we must not neglect the state‚Äôs most pressing needs," Gov. Perdue said.† "My proposed biennial budget makes strategic investments to create jobs and increases overall per student spending, while ensuring that North Carolina state government lives within its means."

Gov. Perdue‚Äôs budget closes a $6.4 billion cumulative gap and reduces spending by $2.6 billion over the next two years.† Her budget also utilizes $2.9 billion of federal recovery funds to support critical services and recommends a $1.3 billion revenue change for tobacco products and alcohol.

Gov. Perdue stresses recurring savings rather than one-time actions, asks agency heads to take a targeted approach to identify reductions, and eliminates or reduces 20 programs that are inefficient, duplicative or costly.

Thank you for the update.

I do not see any money coming to Orange County or Chapel Hill in the National Stabilization Program, either as governmental grant or non-profit.† This is disappointing to me.

Is this another area of dangerous technology that you know nothing about except that they are well funded?† I see no meetings on your agenda that would inform you of the alternatives or risks involved in this technology.

I supported the late Governor Ann Richards in Texas and observed her loss of an election because of her failure to keep promises about stopping polluters.† She too disappointed us when she took work for the tobacco industry after she left office.†

Will we now see the Nanotechnology Governor?† Did you know these small particles can go through your skin and the cells of your body?† Please educate yourself on the precautionary principal of regulation.

> Governor Perdue Announces FY 2009-2011 Budget

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday†announced her 2009-2011 proposed budget.† Despite facing the most challenging budget situation in decades, her budget increases per-pupil spending, invests in job creation and protects public safety through probation, mental health and anti-gang initiatives.
"As families and businesses across our state are tightening their belts to make ends meet, government must do the same.† But, in the process, we must not neglect the stateís most pressing needs," Gov. Perdue said.† "My proposed biennial budget makes strategic investments to create jobs and increases overall per student spending, while ensuring that North Carolina state government lives within its means."
Gov. Perdueís budget closes a $6.4 billion cumulative gap and reduces spending by $2.6 billion over the next two years.† Her budget also utilizes $2.9 billion of federal recovery funds to support critical services and recommends a $1.3 billion revenue change for tobacco products and alcohol.
Gov. Perdue stresses recurring savings rather than one-time actions, asks agency heads to take a targeted approach to identify reductions, and eliminates or reduces 20 programs that are inefficient, duplicative or costly.

Governor Perdue Opens Piedmont Office in Charlotte

Today Gov. Perdue announced the official opening of the Governorís Piedmont Office in Charlotte, fulfilling a campaign pledge.
ìI have pledged to be a governor who represents all people, in all parts of North Carolina,î said Perdue. ìOur state has governorsí offices in the west and in the east. It is important we have an office that is accessible to the residents of this region as well.î
The office is in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Government Center, in uptown Charlotte. It will be staffed full-time by the director of the piedmont office.
Perdue was joined by Lt. Gov. Walter Dalton, Commerce Secretary Keith Crisco, local elected officials and area business leaders at the office opening.
The office phone number is (704) 330-5290.

$48.85 Million in Neighborhood Stabilization Grants Announced

Wednesday, Gov. Bev Perdue announced that 20 local governments, nonprofits and other organizations have received grant awards totaling $48.85 million under the new federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program developed late last year by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The programís purpose is to assist those areas hit hardest by the housing crisis.
ìForeclosures, subprime mortgages and mortgage defaults are hurting homeowners, families and our communities,î Perdue said. ìThese new federal funds will go to communities most severely affected by the housing crisis and will be used effectively. Iím encouraging all participating organizations to collaborate in order to leverage these grant funds and make them go even further.î
Local Government Recipients: City of Raleigh, $2.5 million; Wake County, $2.5 million; City of Charlotte, $2.5 million; City of Greensboro, $2.5 million; City of Winston-Salem, $2.5 million; City of High Point, $2.5 million; City of Gastonia, $2 million; Henderson/Vance County, $2 million; City of Durham, $2 million; City of Rocky Mount, $2 million; City of Lexington, $2 million.
Non-profit Agency Recipients: St. Augustine, in Raleigh, $2 million; Charlotte Housing Authority,† $2 million; Guilford Habitat for Humanity, $2 million; Forsyth Habitat for Humanity, $2 million; Passage Home (in Wake County), $2 million; Greensboro Housing Authority, $2 million.
Statewide Agency/intermediary Recipients: Self-Help Credit Union, $2.5 million; N.C. Community Development Initiative, $3.5 million; and N.C. Housing Finance Agency, $4 million.
NSP funding is provided through HUDís Community Development Block Grant program under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. In North Carolina, the NSP grants are administered by the Commerce Departmentís Division of Community Assistance. DCA staff developed North Carolinaís guidelines through a public process late last year. Total NSP grant funding to North Carolina is $52.1 million; 5 percent of that will be used by DCA to implement and monitor the program.

Governor Proposes Legislation to Increase State Mental Health Facility Transparency

Wednesday,†Bev Perdue announced that she will work with Attorney General Roy Cooper and proposed legislation to increase the transparency of state mental health, developmental disability and substance abuse facilities by making more information in death records public.
ìIn North Carolina, the welfare of our citizens always comes first,î said Gov. Perdue. ìEnsuring that important information in death records is public will make state facilities more accountable for the people in their care, restore public confidence and rebuild public trust.î
Perdue and Cooperís proposal would require the following information regarding deaths in state facilities to be public information:
- The name, sex, age and date of birth of the deceased;
> - The name of the facility providing the report;
> - The date, time and location of the death;
> - A brief description of the circumstances of death, including the manner of death if known; and
> - A list of all entities to whom the event was reported.

Budget Reform and Accountability Commission

Last week, Gov. Bev Perdue† announced that Hilda Pinnix-Ragland of Cary and Norris Tolson of Pinetops will serve as co-chairs of the Budget Reform and Accountability Commission (BRAC). Perdue established the commission to help her locate and eliminate wasteful spending while increasing efficiency in government.
ìIt is the responsibility of government to ensure every tax dollar is used as efficiently and wisely as possible,î said Perdue. ìI expect my BRAC team to root out wasteful and unnecessary spending, hold government accountable for its appropriations and help ensure taxpayers are not funding ineffective or unsuccessful programs.î
The commissionís first task will be to conduct a detailed review of the stateís entire continuation budget to identify inefficiencies, and develop options for cuts and consolidations.
The initial membership of the BRAC is expected to be named within the next week.

Governor Beverly Perdue:

There is one major step that would help to reduce the budget deficit for the coming year, one that would cost no jobs or cuts in budgets for specific programs.†

Take a†good look at salaries of those appointees earning annual salaries of six figures and announce a†ten percent cut†in the next budget year† in all†six-figure salaries.††That would mean†one whose base salary was $120,000 a year would have a base pay monthly pay of $9,000 a month instead of $10,000.† To the unemployed and those struggling to get by on a much lower income, those people†still have†their job, and†a temporary 10% cut in pay could hardly look like a hardship to†many others (teachers, police) earning much less while†watching vacant positions go unfilled.

Please add a feature or link in these emails to allow for comments or suggestions. If the Governor really wants to be ëin touchí with the people, a dialog should be established. Otherwise; the emails become merely an electronic proclamation which I can read in the newspaper (assuming these continue to be printed); but have no voice in the matter. Donít be afraid to let us speak!



A dictator can be transparent to the public; but is still a dictator if they do not care what their subjects think or feel!

Governor Perdue Announces FY 2009-2011 Budget

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday†announced her 2009-2011 proposed budget.† Despite facing the most challenging budget situation in decades, her budget increases per-pupil spending, invests in job creation and protects public safety through probation, mental health and anti-gang initiatives.



"As families and businesses across our state are tightening their belts to make ends meet, government must do the same.† But, in the process, we must not neglect the stateís most pressing needs," Gov. Perdue said.† "My proposed biennial budget makes strategic investments to create jobs and increases overall per student spending, while ensuring that North Carolina state government lives within its means."



Gov. Perdueís budget closes a $6.4 billion cumulative gap and reduces spending by $2.6 billion over the next two years.† Her budget also utilizes $2.9 billion of federal recovery funds to support critical services and recommends a $1.3 billion revenue change for tobacco products and alcohol.



Gov. Perdue stresses recurring savings rather than one-time actions, asks agency heads to take a targeted approach to identify reductions, and eliminates or reduces 20 programs that are inefficient, duplicative or costly.

$48.85 Million in Neighborhood Stabilization Grants Announced

Wednesday, Gov. Bev Perdue announced that 20 local governments, nonprofits and other organizations have received grant awards totaling $48.85 million under the new federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program developed late last year by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The programís purpose is to assist those areas hit hardest by the housing crisis.



ìForeclosures, subprime mortgages and mortgage defaults are hurting homeowners, families and our communities,î Perdue said. ìThese new federal funds will go to communities most severely affected by the housing crisis and will be used effectively. Iím encouraging all participating organizations to collaborate in order to leverage these grant funds and make them go even further.î

- The name of the facility providing the report;
- The date, time and location of the death;
- A brief description of the circumstances of death, including the manner of death if known; and

From† Tom Hobbs†† Newport† NC

Shouldn't it be against our Constitution to tax just a
certain group of people?† You continue to put the tax
burden on the group that†enjoyes smoking and those
that get pleasure from†having a drink of alcohol.

These are the small pleasures the working person can
still enjoy.† You let people get addicted over many years
of consumption and then run the taxes up so high it
will make them suffer for other needs.

You don't use any of the tax money to help the smokers
health cost or insurance cost.† You just put it in the
general fund like the federal taxes that were supposed
to be for smokers health.

I and every one I know is against any more tax increases
including tobacco and alcohol.† Please stop this†tax, tax,
tax and give away to those who don't pay taxes.

Governor Perdue,
In your thorough and comprehensive review of the State's past expenditures, did you ever consider eliminating the 103 State Alcoholic Beverage Control Boards? This political patronage is totally unnecessary.

No doubt inevitable.††

All politicians, well intentioned or not, seek to raise revenues, via taxes, in the least politically impactive way.† Governor Perdue, in raising taxes on tobacco and alcohol, follows a road well traveled in years gone by, joining the ranks of other ineffective, and to some extent gutless,†leaders of our state.

Of course taxing tobacco comes with all sorts of seemingly viable arguments.† Smoking leads to all sorts of health issues which stress the healthcare system across the spectrum.† Some of these stresses hit the state directly through Medicaid and other programs.† Others affect us all through higher insurance costs, doctor's fees , etc.† If these stresses, costs, are so impactive as to require remedial action, then outlawing smoking is the appropriate solution.† Politically, of course, that tends to make†one-time Governors.† The more insidious way is to continually raise taxes.† Maybe the ultimate goal can be reached and the state, and the feds as well, can make a few bucks along the way.† Never pass up a chance to make money while doing socially good things.

Any amateur observer can see that the bulk of smokers are those of lesser means.† Over the years anti-smoking campaigns and education have led the more affluent and better educated to abandon smoking.† Chances are that over time the smoking†population will continue to decline without any new taxes or prohibition laws.† One can hardly argue that raising taxes on smoking won't hasten that decline.† In the interim, however, Governor Perdue seeks to balance her budget on the backs of those still "sinning".† The demographics would appear to suggest that this is a politically safe risk.

Now you can't make the same argument about alcohol.† Most recent studies have suggested that a regular, moderate use of alcohol improves health.† If health costs are to be our justification for raising revenues, in a targeted way, then reason would proffer that we should decrease taxes on alcohol.† Blasphemy!† That increases the budget problem.† That can't be a good idea.

We have this process called the "income tax".† It's structured in a†progressive manner so increases could be directed at those who can better afford to pay, either by raising the higher rates or through surtaxes on higher incomes.† Here comes the clatter about†"class warfare".† Baloney!† When times are tough, those with means should be called upon to help out "not only†in proportion to their†revenue, but something†more than in that proportion".† Read your Adam Smith.

The fact that we're seeking to raise taxes period negates any argument about raising taxes in a recession.† Since elected officials are elected to look out for the welfare of all our citizens, most especially in the Democratic view, those who need the most help, raising taxes that essentially impact low and/or middle income†earners, appears contrary to that view.† In our culture we honor, just as much, if not more so, those whose heroism ended in their demise, as those who lived to†fight another day.† Might be time for a little more "valor" on the part of all our elected officials.† Could we start with the Governor?†

Governor Perdue Announces FY 2009-2011 Budget

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday†announced her 2009-2011 proposed budget.† Despite facing the most challenging budget situation in decades, her budget increases per-pupil spending, invests in job creation and protects public safety through probation, mental health and anti-gang initiatives.

"As families and businesses across our state are tightening their belts to make ends meet, government must do the same.† But, in the process, we must not neglect the stateís most pressing needs," Gov. Perdue said.† "My proposed biennial budget makes strategic investments to create jobs and increases overall per student spending, while ensuring that North Carolina state government lives within its means."

Gov. Perdueís budget closes a $6.4 billion cumulative gap and reduces spending by $2.6 billion over the next two years.† Her budget also utilizes $2.9 billion of federal recovery funds to support critical services and recommends a $1.3 billion revenue change for tobacco products and alcohol.

Gov. Perdue stresses recurring savings rather than one-time actions, asks agency heads to take a targeted approach to identify reductions, and eliminates or reduces 20 programs that are inefficient, duplicative or costly.

ìI have pledged to be a governor who represents all people, in all parts of North Carolina,î said Perdue. ìOur state has governorsí offices in the west and in the east. It is important we have an office that is accessible to the residents of this region as well.î

The office is in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Government Center, in uptown Charlotte. It will be staffed full-time by the director of the piedmont office.

Perdue was joined by Lt. Gov. Walter Dalton, Commerce Secretary Keith Crisco, local elected officials and area business leaders at the office opening.

The office phone number is (704) 330-5290.


$48.85 Million in Neighborhood Stabilization Grants Announced

Wednesday, Gov. Bev Perdue announced that 20 local governments, nonprofits and other organizations have received grant awards totaling $48.85 million under the new federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program developed late last year by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The programís purpose is to assist those areas hit hardest by the housing crisis.

ìForeclosures, subprime mortgages and mortgage defaults are hurting homeowners, families and our communities,î Perdue said. ìThese new federal funds will go to communities most severely affected by the housing crisis and will be used effectively. Iím encouraging all participating organizations to collaborate in order to leverage these grant funds and make them go even further.î

Local Government Recipients: City of Raleigh, $2.5 million; Wake County, $2.5 million; City of Charlotte, $2.5 million; City of Greensboro, $2.5 million; City of Winston-Salem, $2.5 million; City of High Point, $2.5 million; City of Gastonia, $2 million; Henderson/Vance County, $2 million; City of Durham, $2 million; City of Rocky Mount, $2 million; City of Lexington, $2 million.

Non-profit Agency Recipients: St. Augustine, in Raleigh, $2 million; Charlotte Housing Authority,† $2 million; Guilford Habitat for Humanity, $2 million; Forsyth Habitat for Humanity, $2 million; Passage Home (in Wake County), $2 million; Greensboro Housing Authority, $2 million.

Statewide Agency/intermediary Recipients: Self-Help Credit Union, $2.5 million; N.C. Community Development Initiative, $3.5 million; and N.C. Housing Finance Agency, $4 million.

NSP funding is provided through HUDís Community Development Block Grant program under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. In North Carolina, the NSP grants are administered by the Commerce Departmentís Division of Community Assistance. DCA staff developed North Carolinaís guidelines through a public process late last year. Total NSP grant funding to North Carolina is $52.1 million; 5 percent of that will be used by DCA to implement and monitor the program.


Governor Proposes Legislation to Increase State Mental Health Facility Transparency

Wednesday,†Bev Perdue announced that she will work with Attorney General Roy Cooper and proposed legislation to increase the transparency of state mental health, developmental disability and substance abuse facilities by making more information in death records public.

ìIn North Carolina, the welfare of our citizens always comes first,î said Gov. Perdue. ìEnsuring that important information in death records is public will make state facilities more accountable for the people in their care, restore public confidence and rebuild public trust.î

Perdue and Cooperís proposal would require the following information regarding deaths in state facilities to be public information:

- The name, sex, age and date of birth of the deceased;
> - The name of the facility providing the report;
> - The date, time and location of the death;
> - A brief description of the circumstances of death, including the manner of death if known; and
> - A list of all entities to whom the event was reported.

Budget Reform and Accountability Commission

Last week, Gov. Bev Perdue† announced that Hilda Pinnix-Ragland of Cary and Norris Tolson of Pinetops will serve as co-chairs of the Budget Reform and Accountability Commission (BRAC). Perdue established the commission to help her locate and eliminate wasteful spending while increasing efficiency in government.

ìIt is the responsibility of government to ensure every tax dollar is used as efficiently and wisely as possible,î said Perdue. ìI expect my BRAC team to root out wasteful and unnecessary spending, hold government accountable for its appropriations and help ensure taxpayers are not funding ineffective or unsuccessful programs.î

The commissionís first task will be to conduct a detailed review of the stateís entire continuation budget to identify inefficiencies, and develop options for cuts and consolidations.

The initial membership of the BRAC is expected to be named within the next week.

Governor Perdue Announces FY 2009-2011 Budget

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday†announced her 2009-2011 proposed budget.† Despite facing the most challenging budget situation in decades, her budget increases per-pupil spending, invests in job creation and protects public safety through probation, mental health and anti-gang initiatives.

"As families and businesses across our state are tightening their belts to make ends meet, government must do the same.† But, in the process, we must not neglect the state‚Äôs most pressing needs," Gov. Perdue said.† "My proposed biennial budget makes strategic investments to create jobs and increases overall per student spending, while ensuring that North Carolina state government lives within its means."

Gov. Perdue‚Äôs budget closes a $6.4 billion cumulative gap and reduces spending by $2.6 billion over the next two years.† Her budget also utilizes $2.9 billion of federal recovery funds to support critical services and recommends a $1.3 billion revenue change for tobacco products and alcohol.

Gov. Perdue stresses recurring savings rather than one-time actions, asks agency heads to take a targeted approach to identify reductions, and eliminates or reduces 20 programs that are inefficient, duplicative or costly.

Dear Honorable Governor Purdue:
I writing today to say that I very saddened by the comment in a recent newspaper article saying that you do not prefer furloughs 
since it sends a negative message to proposed businessess who may want to locate in North Carolina.  I find it very difficult to 
understand the rationale as to why you would feel that layoff of dedicated state employees is better than allowing them to take 
some unpaid time off.  Who is providing the guidance on this issue.  Maybe they need to talk to ALL 600,000+ State employees who 
would rather take some unpaid time off and keep their jobs than be laid off and have to resort to unemployment.  There does not 
seem to be any rational thinking to this standpoint.  How can it be better to send long time employees packing on the hope that a 
company will come here.
It sends a better message to say the we do care about our employees and will let them take furlough time as opposed to laying them 
off.  The financial sense in this just does not add up and when you have to tell those employees that they are gone then what will 
be the issue?  Many of my coworkers have said that we would rather take unpaid time off voluntarliy rather than be forced out.  
The action of laying off State employees sends a larger message to companies coming to look here.  Putting it bluntly it tells 
them that the State really does not care to look at ALL options when it comes to keeping State employees working.  Many people 
NEED these jobs and cannot endure being unemployed.  Unemployment compensation only lasts for so long!.  
Please allow us as State employees to make a voluntary decision as to what we would like to do in order to keep our jobs.  We are 
what keeps this great State running and we want to continue making this happen.  
Thank you 
John Saylor

> Governor Perdue Announces FY 2009-2011 Budget

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday†announced her 2009-2011 proposed budget.† Despite facing the most challenging budget situation in decades, her budget increases per-pupil spending, invests in job creation and protects public safety through probation, mental health and anti-gang initiatives.
"As families and businesses across our state are tightening their belts to make ends meet, government must do the same.† But, in the process, we must not neglect the stateís most pressing needs," Gov. Perdue said.† "My proposed biennial budget makes strategic investments to create jobs and increases overall per student spending, while ensuring that North Carolina state government lives within its means."
Gov. Perdueís budget closes a $6.4 billion cumulative gap and reduces spending by $2.6 billion over the next two years.† Her budget also utilizes $2.9 billion of federal recovery funds to support critical services and recommends a $1.3 billion revenue change for tobacco products and alcohol.
Gov. Perdue stresses recurring savings rather than one-time actions, asks agency heads to take a targeted approach to identify reductions, and eliminates or reduces 20 programs that are inefficient, duplicative or costly.

Perdue was joined by Lt. Gov. Walter Dalton, Commerce Secretary Keith Crisco, local elected officials and area business leaders at the office opening.

$48.85 Million in Neighborhood Stabilization Grants Announced

Wednesday, Gov. Bev Perdue announced that 20 local governments, nonprofits and other organizations have received grant awards totaling $48.85 million under the new federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program developed late last year by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The programís purpose is to assist those areas hit hardest by the housing crisis.
ìForeclosures, subprime mortgages and mortgage defaults are hurting homeowners, families and our communities,î Perdue said. ìThese new federal funds will go to communities most severely affected by the housing crisis and will be used effectively. Iím encouraging all participating organizations to collaborate in order to leverage these grant funds and make them go even further.î
Local Government Recipients: City of Raleigh, $2.5 million; Wake County, $2.5 million; City of Charlotte, $2.5 million; City of Greensboro, $2.5 million; City of Winston-Salem, $2.5 million; City of High Point, $2.5 million; City of Gastonia, $2 million; Henderson/Vance County, $2 million; City of Durham, $2 million; City of Rocky Mount, $2 million; City of Lexington, $2 million.

In North Carolina, the NSP grants are administered by the Commerce Departmentís Division of Community Assistance. DCA staff developed North Carolinaís guidelines through a public process late last year. Total NSP grant funding to North Carolina is $52.1 million; 5 percent of that will be used by DCA to implement and monitor the program.

Governor Proposes Legislation to Increase State Mental Health Facility Transparency

Wednesday,†Bev Perdue announced that she will work with Attorney General Roy Cooper and proposed legislation to increase the transparency of state mental health, developmental disability and substance abuse facilities by making more information in death records public.
ìIn North Carolina, the welfare of our citizens always comes first,î said Gov. Perdue. ìEnsuring that important information in death records is public will make state facilities more accountable for the people in their care, restore public confidence and rebuild public trust.î
Perdue and Cooperís proposal would require the following information regarding deaths in state facilities to be public information:
- The name, sex, age and date of birth of the deceased;
> - The name of the facility providing the report;
> - The date, time and location of the death;
> - A brief description of the circumstances of death, including the manner of death if known; and

I have called your office†and asked for†a specific answer to my question.† Your office stated that someone would call me back.
I want to know why our soldiers of the 30th HHC†have been denied their re-enlistment bonuses.†† As they deploy to Iraq in early April. †We received a letter in the mail stating they would get them.
I have written your office, called your office and I get no response.

I have also asked for an appointment to meet with Governor Perdue.† I have gotten no response to that invitation.

I am not going to stop this until Governor Perdue answers my questions, or makes an appointment with me.
Why are our soldiers that have served for this state and our country being denied their re-enlistment bonuses?† She has only served our state?† What doe she know about how our families sacriface?
I just want an answer as to why these soldiers are being denied that bonus.† It is not just for me, but I am speaking for other wives as well.
I just need you to give us an answer.

Governor Perdue Announces FY 2009-2011 Budget

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday†announced her 2009-2011 proposed budget.† Despite facing the most challenging budget situation in decades, her budget increases per-pupil spending, invests in job creation and protects public safety through probation, mental health and anti-gang initiatives.

"As families and businesses across our state are tightening their belts to make ends meet, government must do the same.† But, in the process, we must not neglect the state‚Äôs most pressing needs," Gov. Perdue said.† "My proposed biennial budget makes strategic investments to create jobs and increases overall per student spending, while ensuring that North Carolina state government lives within its means."

Gov. Perdue‚Äôs budget closes a $6.4 billion cumulative gap and reduces spending by $2.6 billion over the next two years.† Her budget also utilizes $2.9 billion of federal recovery funds to support critical services and recommends a $1.3 billion revenue change for tobacco products and alcohol.

Gov. Perdue stresses recurring savings rather than one-time actions, asks agency heads to take a targeted approach to identify reductions, and eliminates or reduces 20 programs that are inefficient, duplicative or costly.

‚ÄúForeclosures, subprime mortgages and mortgage defaults are hurting homeowners, families and our communities,‚Äù Perdue said. ‚ÄúThese new federal funds will go to communities most severely affected by the housing crisis and will be used effectively.

Total NSP grant funding to North Carolina is $52.1 million; 5 percent of that will be used by DCA to implement and monitor the program.


Governor Proposes Legislation to Increase State Mental Health Facility Transparency

Wednesday,†Bev Perdue announced that she will work with Attorney General Roy Cooper and proposed legislation to increase the transparency of state mental health, developmental disability and substance abuse facilities by making more information in death records public.

Governor Perdue Announces FY 2009-2011 Budget

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday†announced her 2009-2011 proposed budget.† Despite facing the most challenging budget situation in decades, her budget increases per-pupil spending, invests in job creation and protects public safety through probation, mental health and anti-gang initiatives.

"As families and businesses across our state are tightening their belts to make ends meet, government must do the same.† But, in the process, we must not neglect the state‚Äôs most pressing needs," Gov. Perdue said.† "My proposed biennial budget makes strategic investments to create jobs and increases overall per student spending, while ensuring that North Carolina state government lives within its means."

Gov. Perdue‚Äôs budget closes a $6.4 billion cumulative gap and reduces spending by $2.6 billion over the next two years.† Her budget also utilizes $2.9 billion of federal recovery funds to support critical services and recommends a $1.3 billion revenue change for tobacco products and alcohol.

Gov. Perdue stresses recurring savings rather than one-time actions, asks agency heads to take a targeted approach to identify reductions, and eliminates or reduces 20 programs that are inefficient, duplicative or costly.

	Dear Governor Perdue,
I've written you my thoughts about nutrition before, but please let me make one more (rather long, I'm sorry) comment.

My daughter has been exhibiting a schizophrenia-like dementia which
began a few months after a terrible fall in the KDH Library which resulted in multiple jaw and teeth fractures and a TBI.

First, I learned that few seem to know anything about effects of and what to expect maybe months down the road after a head injury.

Next I learned how hard it is to get benefits from ANYBODY, when you have mental problems following recovery from such an injury.

Next I learned that these and other mental problems are being successfully treated through orthomolecular (nutritional) medicine, and yet we don't have anyone within 500 miles of here who practices this benign approach or accepts medicaid for it -- that is, IF you can get medicaid.

Then I learned that malnutrition can lead to Pellagra, which eventually leads to a schizophrenia-like dementia -- BINGO.

My daughter had lost her appetite after pretty much starving while her mouth was wired shut, and later while awaiting tooth repair, which I HAD TO PAY FOR OUT OF POCKET, or the doctors would have not removed her wires or fixed her teeth -- MEDICAID AND FOOD STAMPS HAD BEEN DENIED -- DARE SOCIAL SERVICES SAID SHE WASN'T ELIGIBLE FOR ANYTHING BECAUSE SHE WASN'T PREGNANT AND DIDN'T HAVE CHILDREN --that is, until I pitched a fit, wrote you, Basnight and Jones.

Ok, so now she has medicaid -- BIG DEAL. By then she became so demented, she wouldn't see anyone.† So I've done lots of research and I've found alternative treatments that have helped a lot, but have also PUT ME NEARLY OUT OF MY HOUSE OF 18 YEARS! ---

Then,† I JUST GOT ALL THE MEDICAL RECORDS FROM THE TIME SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL IN NAGS HEADS.† Turns out, she had low RBCs, low hemoglobin, low Hemocrit, abnormal liver tests, abnormal urine test, and the records showed she had a sinus infection. No drug use was detected (she's never been a drug user or heavy drinker - she was honor student at Manteo and straight As at NC State and Carolina.)† The hospital DID NOT MENTION ONE WORD ABOUT THESE ABNORMAL BLOOD TESTS -- they diagnosed her with psychosis due to head injury and recommended further neurological tests, which we could not pay for because medicaid was denied.

What would have happened if they had treated her anemia, which may or may not have been B deficiency -- it could be iron deficiency - it could be leukemia (what her father died from), and yet no one at the hospital mentioned it at all.

What would happen with our state health care, and the resulting costs. if someone would simply make sure that all POTENTIAL mental patients are SCREENED for vitamin deficiency diseases like Pellagra or Hartnup Disease or even Candida which interferes with B vitamin absorption.

My daughter is improving dramatically with B vitamin supplementation , including NADH (a form of niacin that doesn't flush) and tryptophan (which converts to Niacin), and B12 -- along with a multi-vitamin.† Her anorexia has resolved, and therefore the starvation effects are finally reversing.

What would it have cost the state if she had been put in a mental institution, and knowing what has happened to patients in NC institutions recently, what could have happened to her, especially with her chemical sensitivities and all the toxic products and pesticides being used in many state facilities -- the bathrooms alone in Nash County Hospital put out an odor that gave us both a rash!

I am writing you to say, that first, our health care system must consider more natural approaches to healing and must screen for physical causes that are nutrition-related, along with other physical screening before assuming someone is mentally ill.

Furthermore there has to be more information given out about brain injury -- a simple concussion can result in depression and insomnia and personality changes for months or years after an accident.

Next, I want to emphasize how important the adult and childcare food program is and that it deserves more funding.† Daycare providers are struggling with continuing to serve good-quality meals with rising prices of food NOT matched by the reimbursement they get with the food program.

Furthermore, these daycare providers whom I visit every week, work hard to do a good job, and yet they are often policed like criminals -- the state requires more and more "policing" all the time -- spending money that could be used to FEED kids, rather than try to catch the one in 500 maybe providers who are cheating.† Most of the daycare providers I visit are poor, and yet still caring and working harder all the time to provide better nutrition. They listen to my suggestions and most of them do their best to improve.† But when I suggest they change to whole wheat,for example, you must understand that it is costing them twice what white bread costs. And this requirement for milk every meal is just not the best suggestion. I've seen cases where milk causes severe constipation in children and if they're going to serve so much milk, as is required, they should be able to afford ORGANIC -- hormone-free milk, but they can hardly afford the poisoned milk. (see the movie, The Corporation if you want details on milk contamination).

Wouldn't it save the state so much money in the long run to make sure that every man, woman, and child had the best food and cleanest water available to anyone?† I am certain this would prevent diseases that are costing this state billions.

In a nutshell, these daycare providers should be receiving much higher reimbursement for the meals they serve.† I will continue to nag them about quality, and work hard to research and educate (for a bargain salary, I might add), but they have to have the money to provide the best.

Finally I want to say that I learned that Pellagra was epidemic in the South after the Civil War and also during the great depression. I am beginning to wonder if this epidemic is not at least partly responsible for an epidemic of dementia and mob violence that was prevalent during that period.

In these times, it seems more important than ever that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.† I honestly believe we will find the money to provide excellent nutrition to all in the savings that will result in health care costs -- that is if that is what is desired -- less money going to the health "care" industry.

Sincerely,

Dear Gov. Perdue,

††† About 2 weeks ago I sent an e-mail to your office with concerning what appears to be wasteful spending of our tax dollars by your administration while thousands of our residents are losing their jobs and homes.

††† I have apparently I have been placed on your mailing list, but have yet to receive an answer to my concerns. Ignoring questions and concerns from our citizens do not make them go away; it just makes the issue seem worse. I would really like an answer to my initial correspondance. If it was stopped from reaching you by one of your staff members, maybe that person should be the first to be cut to trim the budget.

† Concerned Citizen

Please stop using the stimulus package money, send it back to the federal government. North Carolina doesn't accept handouts. This state and its citizens can stand on our own feet.

> Governor Perdue Announces FY 2009-2011 Budget

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday†announced her 2009-2011 proposed budget.† Despite facing the most challenging budget situation in decades, her budget increases per-pupil spending, invests in job creation and protects public safety through probation, mental health and anti-gang initiatives.
"As families and businesses across our state are tightening their belts to make ends meet, government must do the same.† But, in the process, we must not neglect the stateís most pressing needs," Gov. Perdue said.† "My proposed biennial budget makes strategic investments to create jobs and increases overall per student spending, while ensuring that North Carolina state government lives within its means."
Gov. Perdueís budget closes a $6.4 billion cumulative gap and reduces spending by $2.6 billion over the next two years.† Her budget also utilizes $2.9 billion of federal recovery funds to support critical services and recommends a $1.3 billion revenue change for tobacco products and alcohol.
Gov. Perdue stresses recurring savings rather than one-time actions, asks agency heads to take a targeted approach to identify reductions, and eliminates or reduces 20 programs that are inefficient, duplicative or costly.

ìI have pledged to be a governor who represents all people, in all parts of North Carolina,î said Perdue. ìOur state has governorsí offices in the west and in the east. It is important we have an office that is accessible to the residents of this region as well.î
The office is in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Government Center, in uptown Charlotte. It will be staffed full-time by the director of the piedmont office.
Perdue was joined by Lt. Gov. Walter Dalton, Commerce Secretary Keith Crisco, local elected officials and area business leaders at the office opening.

$48.85 Million in Neighborhood Stabilization Grants Announced

Wednesday, Gov. Bev Perdue announced that 20 local governments, nonprofits and other organizations have received grant awards totaling $48.85 million under the new federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program developed late last year by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The programís purpose is to assist those areas hit hardest by the housing crisis.
ìForeclosures, subprime mortgages and mortgage defaults are hurting homeowners, families and our communities,î Perdue said. ìThese new federal funds will go to communities most severely affected by the housing crisis and will be used effectively. Iím encouraging all participating organizations to collaborate in order to leverage these grant funds and make them go even further.î
Local Government Recipients: City of Raleigh, $2.5 million; Wake County, $2.5 million; City of Charlotte, $2.5 million; City of Greensboro, $2.5 million; City of Winston-Salem, $2.5 million; City of High Point, $2.5 million; City of Gastonia, $2 million; Henderson/Vance County, $2 million; City of Durham, $2 million; City of Rocky Mount, $2 million; City of Lexington, $2 million.
Non-profit Agency Recipients: St. Augustine, in Raleigh, $2 million; Charlotte Housing Authority,† $2 million; Guilford Habitat for Humanity, $2 million; Forsyth Habitat for Humanity, $2 million; Passage Home (in Wake County), $2 million; Greensboro Housing Authority, $2 million.
Statewide Agency/intermediary Recipients: Self-Help Credit Union, $2.5 million; N.C. Community Development Initiative, $3.5 million; and N.C. Housing Finance Agency, $4 million.
NSP funding is provided through HUDís Community Development Block Grant program under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. In North Carolina, the NSP grants are administered by the Commerce Departmentís Division of Community Assistance. DCA staff developed North Carolinaís guidelines through a public process late last year. Total NSP grant funding to North Carolina is $52.1 million; 5 percent of that will be used by DCA to implement and monitor the program.

Governor Proposes Legislation to Increase State Mental Health Facility Transparency

Wednesday,†Bev Perdue announced that she will work with Attorney General Roy Cooper and proposed legislation to increase the transparency of state mental health, developmental disability and substance abuse facilities by making more information in death records public.
ìIn North Carolina, the welfare of our citizens always comes first,î said Gov. Perdue. ìEnsuring that important information in death records is public will make state facilities more accountable for the people in their care, restore public confidence and rebuild public trust.î
Perdue and Cooperís proposal would require the following information regarding deaths in state facilities to be public information:
- The name, sex, age and date of birth of the deceased;
> - The name of the facility providing the report;
> - The date, time and location of the death;
> - A brief description of the circumstances of death, including the manner of death if known; and
> - A list of all entities to whom the event was reported.

Perdue established the commission to help her locate and eliminate wasteful spending while increasing efficiency in government.
ìIt is the responsibility of government to ensure every tax dollar is used as efficiently and wisely as possible,î said Perdue. ìI expect my BRAC team to root out wasteful and unnecessary spending, hold government accountable for its appropriations and help ensure taxpayers are not funding ineffective or unsuccessful programs.î
The commissionís first task will be to conduct a detailed review of the stateís entire continuation budget to identify inefficiencies, and develop options for cuts and consolidations.
The initial membership of the BRAC is expected to be named within the next week.

President Barack Obama
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
Washington, DC 20500


Dear President Obama:
I am astounded that you told the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that you supported "comprehensive immigration reform." I thought you were on the side of unemployed Americans, not illegal aliens.

Why do you insist on pushing through comprehensive amnesty? There are more than 12 million unemployed Americans and a disproportionate number of these are African and Hispanic Americans? Why do you want to harm America's less-fortunate?

Also, why do you see the need to go to Mexico and ask President Felipe Calderon for help pushing amnesty through Congress? I would hope that you would side with America's unemployed, not Mexico's ruling class.

Please do not proceed with your plans to push an unpopular amnesty bill through the Congress. The American people have proven that they will not stomach any form of amnesty. Please live up to your campaign pledge and bring some "hope" to the American people.
Respectfully resentful,



Mr.†
