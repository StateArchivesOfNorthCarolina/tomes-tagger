Governor Perdue Announces Library-Based "JobSearch Help Desk"

People hunting for jobs, filling out applications, and exploring educational opportunities are turning to the local library to do research at computer terminals. Librarians are busier than ever as they assist customers with internet searches.

The JobSearch Help Desk will train librarians to help patrons connect with employers and conduct job searches at public libraries. Partners in the project are the State Library at the Department of Cultural Resources, the Employment Security Commission, and the Department of Commerce.

Beginning in March, the State Library will conduct training sessions statewide for librarians.  The workshops will focus on use of North Carolina&#700;s statewide electronic database consortium NC LIVE plus print and online tools for job search skills, such as resume writing, job search, and interview resources.

When trained, librarians can help as "employment guides" with the ability to assess where the job seeker is in his or her job search process and direct the individual to the appropriate resources within the library and in their communities.

Each regional workshop will include panels with Employment Services Commission and Department of Commerce work force development professionals to share information on the related services and resources available.  Other elements of the workshop will include Internet resources, on-line databases such as NC LIVE, local and state job listings, and print materials. The workshops will be developed and presented by the State Library's Library Development consultants.


All Counties Now in Drought or Abnormally Dry

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources announced yesterday that for the first time since August, all 100 North Carolina counties are experiencing drought or abnormally dry conditions.

Abnormally dry conditions cover the entire eastern portion of North Carolina and parts of the Piedmont due to recent warm and dry weather. Conditions in western North Carolina, the state&#700;s driest area, worsened.  There are now 29 counties across the state in moderate drought and ten counties in the Hendersonville metropolitan area are facing severe drought.

There may not be any relief any time soon. Long-range outlooks from the National Climate Prediction Center show the possibility of unseasonably dry weather for several more months. Water conservation can help stretch the state&#700;s water resources for homeowners, businesses, agricultural users, and ecological interests.  The following are some water conservation tips:

For indoor water conservation, install a low-flow shower head; turn off water when brushing teeth; do only full loads of laundry; wash dishes by hand and repair leaking toilets.

For outdoor water conservation, water plants early in the day; plant only native grasses and shrubs; fix leaks in hose connections; use mulch to keep soil moist and collect and recycle rainwater.
> 120 New Jobs Coming to Forsyth County

This week Piedmont Aviation Component Services LLC, a provider of aircraft maintenance services and sales, announced plans to expand its operations in Kernersville. The company plans to invest $5.8 million and create 120 jobs this year by relocating sister company Limco from Oklahoma to North Carolina. The announcement was made possible in part by a $44,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

Piedmont Aviation Component Services&#700; roots stem from the 1940 creation of Piedmont Aviation in Winston-Salem, from which emerged Piedmont Airlines.  North Carolina has a growing aerospace sector, and Governor Perdue is excited to work with a homegrown company like Piedmont.

Thank you so much for your E-mail.  If I could breathe the air over there without getting sick I'd consider moving there. 

I can suggest that people remove their grass lawns, rip out water needing plants - go to xeroscaping with rocks, and drought tolerant plants, close the water guzzling golf courses, and quit building more,  turn off the 'decorative' fountains, close the swimming pools.

I'd send you my resume - I've got lots of experience, a wide variety of skills, across a wide range of disciplines and a history of innovation, research, implementing change, working with 'executive level' priorities, forming executive level plans...

BUT - I can't tolerate the toxicity and fine particle pollution - even if I live in an all electric facility.  The problem isn't global warming - it's global pollution. 

We can cool from heat, warm from cold and go anywhere at anytime if we have clean, constantly renewable energy - like solar -and individual travel with clean energy and movement without tires (like research between the auto and aerospace, airplane industries could produce - a 'hydroplane' - a 'car' driven by solar riding on a cushion of air - no fine particle pollution created 'where the rubber meets the road'.  When the air is so toxic we can't breathe it without getting sick - we've got a mounting species survival hazard.  Add toxins in water, toxins in the soil, toxins in the food - and the unknown, incalculable genetic damage done by it all - and we have a human survival crisis.

I tell you what.  Go to <http://www.dialogue-linda.blogspot.com>http://www.dialogue-linda.blogspot.com.  There you'll find a quick summary of some of the things I've done and the level at which I've made life-saving decisions.  I'll probably continue the blog later with more, but for now you will find there in the To Yale Medicine - What I've Found the reason I cringed for North Carolina's loss of the Heavenly Mountain 'campus'. 

You could have been a leader  - a vanguard - in a whole new health paradigm. 

Feel free to E-mail me - or contact me - if I can be of assistance in western north carolina.  I just might have been able to breathe without getting sick up on top of that mountain - and have been part of something vital for the future.  Charlotte and all of the big, hot, polluted southern cities, no matter how much I would want to live there, no matter the opportunities I could find there - I cannot live there.

My opportunities for the future must be grounded in biological truth and within the parameters of biologically sustainable life.  Enjoy the blog - every bit of it is the truth.

Happy Valen tine's Day - state of birth - north carolina; city of birth - charlotte

Linda Dow

Governor Perdue Announces Library-Based "JobSearch Help Desk"

People hunting for jobs, filling out applications, and exploring educational opportunities are turning to the local library to do research at computer terminals. Librarians are busier than ever as they assist customers with internet searches.

The JobSearch Help Desk will train librarians to help patrons connect with employers and conduct job searches at public libraries. Partners in the project are the State Library at the Department of Cultural Resources, the Employment Security Commission, and the Department of Commerce.

Beginning in March, the State Library will conduct training sessions statewide for librarians.  The workshops will focus on use of North Carolina’s statewide electronic database consortium NC LIVE plus print and online tools for job search skills, such as resume writing, job search, and interview resources.

When trained, librarians can help as "employment guides" with the ability to assess where the job seeker is in his or her job search process and direct the individual to the appropriate resources within the library and in their communities.

Each regional workshop will include panels with Employment Services Commission and Department of Commerce work force development professionals to share information on the related services and resources available.  Other elements of the workshop will include Internet resources, on-line databases such as NC LIVE, local and state job listings, and print materials. The workshops will be developed and presented by the State Library's Library Development consultants.


All Counties Now in Drought or Abnormally Dry

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources announced yesterday that for the first time since August, all 100 North Carolina counties are experiencing drought or abnormally dry conditions.

Abnormally dry conditions cover the entire eastern portion of North Carolina and parts of the Piedmont due to recent warm and dry weather. Conditions in western North Carolina, the state’s driest area, worsened.  There are now 29 counties across the state in moderate drought and ten counties in the Hendersonville metropolitan area are facing severe drought.

There may not be any relief any time soon. Long-range outlooks from the National Climate Prediction Center show the possibility of unseasonably dry weather for several more months. Water conservation can help stretch the state’s water resources for homeowners, businesses, agricultural users, and ecological interests.  The following are some water conservation tips:

For indoor water conservation, install a low-flow shower head; turn off water when brushing teeth; do only full loads of laundry; wash dishes by hand and repair leaking toilets.

For outdoor water conservation, water plants early in the day; plant only native grasses and shrubs; fix leaks in hose connections; use mulch to keep soil moist and collect and recycle rainwater.
> 120 New Jobs Coming to Forsyth County

This week Piedmont Aviation Component Services LLC, a provider of aircraft maintenance services and sales, announced plans to expand its operations in Kernersville. The company plans to invest $5.8 million and create 120 jobs this year by relocating sister company Limco from Oklahoma to North Carolina. The announcement was made possible in part by a $44,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

Piedmont Aviation Component Services’ roots stem from the 1940 creation of Piedmont Aviation in Winston-Salem, from which emerged Piedmont Airlines.  North Carolina has a growing aerospace sector, and Governor Perdue is excited to work with a homegrown company like Piedmont.

All Counties Now in Drought or Abnormally Dry

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources announced yesterday that for the first time since August, all 100 North Carolina counties are experiencing drought or abnormally dry conditions.

Abnormally dry conditions cover the entire eastern portion of North Carolina and parts of the Piedmont due to recent warm and dry weather. Conditions in western North Carolina, the stateâ€™s driest area, worsened.  There are now 29 counties across the state in moderate drought and ten counties in the Hendersonville metropolitan area are facing severe drought.

There may not be any relief any time soon. Long-range outlooks from the National Climate Prediction Center show the possibility of unseasonably dry weather for several more months. Water conservation can help stretch the stateâ€™s water resources for homeowners, businesses, agricultural users, and ecological interests.  The following are some water conservation tips:

For indoor water conservation, install a low-flow shower head; turn off water when brushing teeth; do only full loads of laundry; wash dishes by hand and repair leaking toilets.

For outdoor water conservation, water plants early in the day; plant only native grasses and shrubs; fix leaks in hose connections; use mulch to keep soil moist and collect and recycle rainwater.
120 New Jobs Coming to Forsyth County

This week Piedmont Aviation Component Services LLC, a provider of aircraft maintenance services and sales, announced plans to expand its operations in Kernersville. The company plans to invest $5.8 million and create 120 jobs this year by relocating sister company Limco from Oklahoma to North Carolina. The announcement was made possible in part by a $44,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

Piedmont Aviation Component Servicesâ€™ roots stem from the 1940 creation of Piedmont Aviation in Winston-Salem, from which emerged Piedmont Airlines.  North Carolina has a growing aerospace sector, and Governor Perdue is excited to work with a homegrown company like Piedmont.

       As one of your supporters, I implore you to please pay a surprise visit to the Caswell County Alternative School in Yanceyville, NC to observe first-hand how
understaffed and underfunded its program is to help the children in our county get a free appropriate public education.

Beginning in March, the State Library will conduct training sessions statewide for librarians.  The workshops will focus on use of North Carolina’s statewide electronic database consortium NC LIVE plus print and online tools for job search skills, such as resume writing, job search, and interview resources.

All Counties Now in Drought or Abnormally Dry

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources announced yesterday that for the first time since August, all 100 North Carolina counties are experiencing drought or abnormally dry conditions.

Abnormally dry conditions cover the entire eastern portion of North Carolina and parts of the Piedmont due to recent warm and dry weather. Conditions in western North Carolina, the state’s driest area, worsened.  There are now 29 counties across the state in moderate drought and ten counties in the Hendersonville metropolitan area are facing severe drought.

There may not be any relief any time soon. Long-range outlooks from the National Climate Prediction Center show the possibility of unseasonably dry weather for several more months. Water conservation can help stretch the state’s water resources for homeowners, businesses, agricultural users, and ecological interests.  The following are some water conservation tips:

For indoor water conservation, install a low-flow shower head; turn off water when brushing teeth; do only full loads of laundry; wash dishes by hand and repair leaking toilets.

For outdoor water conservation, water plants early in the day; plant only native grasses and shrubs; fix leaks in hose connections; use mulch to keep soil moist and collect and recycle rainwater.
> 120 New Jobs Coming to Forsyth County

This week Piedmont Aviation Component Services LLC, a provider of aircraft maintenance services and sales, announced plans to expand its operations in Kernersville. The company plans to invest $5.8 million and create 120 jobs this year by relocating sister company Limco from Oklahoma to North Carolina. The announcement was made possible in part by a $44,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

Piedmont Aviation Component Services’ roots stem from the 1940 creation of Piedmont Aviation in Winston-Salem, from which emerged Piedmont Airlines.  North Carolina has a growing aerospace sector, and Governor Perdue is excited to work with a homegrown company like Piedmont.

Governor Perdue,

I'd like to review my company, Environmental Carolinas, with you.



I believe it can be a cornerstone for your environmental efforts. The approach is unique and exclusive for the Carolinas. I'd like to set up a meeting with you to discuss.

I'd like to address part of this recent email message, specifically >> wash dishes by hand <<. I don't think that's the best way to save water. If people have an energy star diswasher it is actully MORE efficient to use than washing dishes by hand.

This is an ignorant/erroneous statement!  Aren’t you about 5 months too late?  Yes – we were in drought conditions at the end of the fall season; however, we have recovered within the realm of seasonal expectation and this is just a sign of how knee-jerk all politicians have become in order to fulfill their new “scare tactics”.  It’s time you wake up and realize it’s a chance that at least 50% of your constituents are reasonably intelligent! 

Good luck on your “new digs”!

Beverly,



I am excited that you have taken an office in our city/county (that makes up about 1/10 of the state’s population and economy).



Please spend some “quality” time here and I am sure our whole Meck delegation would love to welcome you here and visit when you have time.



Good luck in the next four years. I know you are undaunted by the challenges apparent now and ahead!

All Counties Now in Drought or Abnormally Dry

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources announced yesterday that for the first time since August, all 100 North Carolina counties are experiencing drought or abnormally dry conditions.



Abnormally dry conditions cover the entire eastern portion of North Carolina and parts of the Piedmont due to recent warm and dry weather. Conditions in western North Carolina, the state’s driest area, worsened.  There are now 29 counties across the state in moderate drought and ten counties in the Hendersonville metropolitan area are facing severe drought.



There may not be any relief any time soon. Long-range outlooks from the National Climate Prediction Center show the possibility of unseasonably dry weather for several more months. Water conservation can help stretch the state’s water resources for homeowners, businesses, agricultural users, and ecological interests.  The following are some water conservation tips:



For indoor water conservation, install a low-flow shower head; turn off water when brushing teeth; do only full loads of laundry; wash dishes by hand and repair leaking toilets.



For outdoor water conservation, water plants early in the day; plant only native grasses and shrubs; fix leaks in hose connections; use mulch to keep soil moist and collect and recycle rainwater.

120 New Jobs Coming to Forsyth County

This week Piedmont Aviation Component Services LLC, a provider of aircraft maintenance services and sales, announced plans to expand its operations in Kernersville. The company plans to invest $5.8 million and create 120 jobs this year by relocating sister company Limco from Oklahoma to North Carolina. The announcement was made possible in part by a $44,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.



Piedmont Aviation Component Services’ roots stem from the 1940 creation of Piedmont Aviation in Winston-Salem, from which emerged Piedmont Airlines.  North Carolina has a growing aerospace sector, and Governor Perdue is excited to work with a homegrown company like Piedmont.

Governor Perdue Announces Library-Based "JobSearch Help Desk"

People hunting for jobs, filling out applications, and exploring educational opportunities are turning to the local library to do research at computer terminals. Librarians are busier than ever as they assist customers with internet searches.

The JobSearch Help Desk will train librarians to help patrons connect with employers and conduct job searches at public libraries. Partners in the project are the State Library at the Department of Cultural Resources, the Employment Security Commission, and the Department of Commerce.

Beginning in March, the State Library will conduct training sessions statewide for librarians.  The workshops will focus on use of North Carolinaâ€™s statewide electronic database consortium NC LIVE plus print and online tools for job search skills, such as resume writing, job search, and interview resources.

When trained, librarians can help as "employment guides" with the ability to assess where the job seeker is in his or her job search process and direct the individual to the appropriate resources within the library and in their communities.

That office space is just about as big as my house. Good to know that tax dollars I'm getting raped on. Are being put to good use. I bet the lease is expensive also. Considering the building it's in.

Could you please pass this on to Governor Purdue.  Historically, the Western North Carolina region has always felt like a step child when it came to Governorship initiatives.  As a member of the democrat executive committee for Macon County and builder/owner of a new professional office building next to Southwestern Community College on Siler Road in Macon County I would like to offer Governor Purdue and her staff the opportunity to lease (at a greatly reduced market rate) some of the space for a Western region office.  The symbolism this would generate would go a long way toward getting rid of the step child syndrome and help stem the Republican tide we always have to fight over here.  I have attached some pictures of the property and would welcome a discussion and visit by a staff member to evaluate this proposal.  We can even delay the lease payments to roll it over into the next budget cycle.  This sub-dividable 5,000 sq. ft. facility should be available in June and will have state of the art teleconferencing capability thru the Internet.   Respectfully, Larry Stenger.  Telephone: 828-369-5343, Email: <mailto:Stengernc@aol.com>Stengernc@aol.com   Address: 2540 Ellijay Road, Franklin, NC 28734

Charlotte Office Location Announced

The Governor's Charlotte Office will be located on the second floor of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Government Center.  The 1,343 square foot space is at 600 East Fourth St.  If approved by the Charlotte City Council the lease will begin in March and move-in can begin shortly thereafter.


Governor Perdue Announces Library-Based "JobSearch Help Desk"

People hunting for jobs, filling out applications, and exploring educational opportunities are turning to the local library to do research at computer terminals. Librarians are busier than ever as they assist customers with internet searches.

The JobSearch Help Desk will train librarians to help patrons connect with employers and conduct job searches at public libraries. Partners in the project are the State Library at the Department of Cultural Resources, the Employment Security Commission, and the Department of Commerce.

Beginning in March, the State Library will conduct training sessions statewide for librarians.  The workshops will focus on use of North Carolina's statewide electronic database consortium NC LIVE plus print and online tools for job search skills, such as resume writing, job search, and interview resources.

When trained, librarians can help as "employment guides" with the ability to assess where the job seeker is in his or her job search process and direct the individual to the appropriate resources within the library and in their communities.

Each regional workshop will include panels with Employment Services Commission and Department of Commerce work force development professionals to share information on the related services and resources available.  Other elements of the workshop will include Internet resources, on-line databases such as NC LIVE, local and state job listings, and print materials. The workshops will be developed and presented by the State Library's Library Development consultants.


All Counties Now in Drought or Abnormally Dry

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources announced yesterday that for the first time since August, all 100 North Carolina counties are experiencing drought or abnormally dry conditions.

Abnormally dry conditions cover the entire eastern portion of North Carolina and parts of the Piedmont due to recent warm and dry weather. Conditions in western North Carolina, the state's driest area, worsened.  There are now 29 counties across the state in moderate drought and ten counties in the Hendersonville metropolitan area are facing severe drought.

There may not be any relief any time soon. Long-range outlooks from the National Climate Prediction Center show the possibility of unseasonably dry weather for several more months. Water conservation can help stretch the state's water resources for homeowners, businesses, agricultural users, and ecological interests.  The following are some water conservation tips:

For indoor water conservation, install a low-flow shower head; turn off water when brushing teeth; do only full loads of laundry; wash dishes by hand and repair leaking toilets.

For outdoor water conservation, water plants early in the day; plant only native grasses and shrubs; fix leaks in hose connections; use mulch to keep soil moist and collect and recycle rainwater.
> 120 New Jobs Coming to Forsyth County

This week Piedmont Aviation Component Services LLC, a provider of aircraft maintenance services and sales, announced plans to expand its operations in Kernersville. The company plans to invest $5.8 million and create 120 jobs this year by relocating sister company Limco from Oklahoma to North Carolina. The announcement was made possible in part by a $44,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

Piedmont Aviation Component Services' roots stem from the 1940 creation of Piedmont Aviation in Winston-Salem, from which emerged Piedmont Airlines.  North Carolina has a growing aerospace sector, and Governor Perdue is excited to work with a homegrown company like Piedmont.

I'm thrilled to see that the American Recovery Act has money for special education.  Please let this be additional money for special education programs rather than replacement funds for state or local money.  Special Education has never been fully funded so this is a great help.
Thank you,

Charlotte Office Location Announced

The Governor's Charlotte Office will be located on the second floor of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Government Center.  The 1,343 square foot space is at 600 East Fourth St.  If approved by the Charlotte City Council the lease will begin in March and move-in can begin shortly thereafter.


Governor Perdue Announces Library-Based "JobSearch Help Desk"

People hunting for jobs, filling out applications, and exploring educational opportunities are turning to the local library to do research at computer terminals. Librarians are busier than ever as they assist customers with internet searches.

The JobSearch Help Desk will train librarians to help patrons connect with employers and conduct job searches at public libraries. Partners in the project are the State Library at the Department of Cultural Resources, the Employment Security Commission, and the Department of Commerce.

Beginning in March, the State Library will conduct training sessions statewide for librarians.  The workshops will focus on use of North Carolina's statewide electronic database consortium NC LIVE plus print and online tools for job search skills, such as resume writing, job search, and interview resources.

When trained, librarians can help as "employment guides" with the ability to assess where the job seeker is in his or her job search process and direct the individual to the appropriate resources within the library and in their communities.

Each regional workshop will include panels with Employment Services Commission and Department of Commerce work force development professionals to share information on the related services and resources available.  Other elements of the workshop will include Internet resources, on-line databases such as NC LIVE, local and state job listings, and print materials. The workshops will be developed and presented by the State Library's Library Development consultants.


All Counties Now in Drought or Abnormally Dry

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources announced yesterday that for the first time since August, all 100 North Carolina counties are experiencing drought or abnormally dry conditions.

Abnormally dry conditions cover the entire eastern portion of North Carolina and parts of the Piedmont due to recent warm and dry weather. Conditions in western North Carolina, the state's driest area, worsened.  There are now 29 counties across the state in moderate drought and ten counties in the Hendersonville metropolitan area are facing severe drought.

There may not be any relief any time soon. Long-range outlooks from the National Climate Prediction Center show the possibility of unseasonably dry weather for several more months. Water conservation can help stretch the state's water resources for homeowners, businesses, agricultural users, and ecological interests.  The following are some water conservation tips:

For indoor water conservation, install a low-flow shower head; turn off water when brushing teeth; do only full loads of laundry; wash dishes by hand and repair leaking toilets.

For outdoor water conservation, water plants early in the day; plant only native grasses and shrubs; fix leaks in hose connections; use mulch to keep soil moist and collect and recycle rainwater.
> 120 New Jobs Coming to Forsyth County

This week Piedmont Aviation Component Services LLC, a provider of aircraft maintenance services and sales, announced plans to expand its operations in Kernersville. The company plans to invest $5.8 million and create 120 jobs this year by relocating sister company Limco from Oklahoma to North Carolina. The announcement was made possible in part by a $44,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

Piedmont Aviation Component Services' roots stem from the 1940 creation of Piedmont Aviation in Winston-Salem, from which emerged Piedmont Airlines.  North Carolina has a growing aerospace sector, and Governor Perdue is excited to work with a homegrown company like Piedmont.

Charlotte Office Location Announced

The Governor's Charlotte Office will be located on the second floor of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Government Center.  The 1,343 square foot space is at 600 East Fourth St.  If approved by the Charlotte City Council the lease will begin in March and move-in can begin shortly thereafter.


Governor Perdue Announces Library-Based "JobSearch Help Desk"

People hunting for jobs, filling out applications, and exploring educational opportunities are turning to the local library to do research at computer terminals. Librarians are busier than ever as they assist customers with internet searches.

The JobSearch Help Desk will train librarians to help patrons connect with employers and conduct job searches at public libraries. Partners in the project are the State Library at the Department of Cultural Resources, the Employment Security Commission, and the Department of Commerce.

Beginning in March, the State Library will conduct training sessions statewide for librarians.  The workshops will focus on use of North Carolina's statewide electronic database consortium NC LIVE plus print and online tools for job search skills, such as resume writing, job search, and interview resources.

When trained, librarians can help as "employment guides" with the ability to assess where the job seeker is in his or her job search process and direct the individual to the appropriate resources within the library and in their communities.

Each regional workshop will include panels with Employment Services Commission and Department of Commerce work force development professionals to share information on the related services and resources available.  Other elements of the workshop will include Internet resources, on-line databases such as NC LIVE, local and state job listings, and print materials. The workshops will be developed and presented by the State Library's Library Development consultants.


All Counties Now in Drought or Abnormally Dry

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources announced yesterday that for the first time since August, all 100 North Carolina counties are experiencing drought or abnormally dry conditions.

Abnormally dry conditions cover the entire eastern portion of North Carolina and parts of the Piedmont due to recent warm and dry weather. Conditions in western North Carolina, the state's driest area, worsened.  There are now 29 counties across the state in moderate drought and ten counties in the Hendersonville metropolitan area are facing severe drought.

	There is no drought!  I repeat.  There is NO DROUGHT!!!  Just like liberals; known to create a crisis or make a mountain out of a mole hill, just so they the government can justify a solution that always means robbing us of our freedoms and robbing our wallets.  If we are in a drought, then bring it on.  This is nice weather we are enjoying.  If you want to experience a drought, you need to go to northern Africa where they really are experiencing a drought.

I attempted to submit a suggestion and for some reason it would not go
through so i am submitting via reply to this email. I sincerely hope
that you will take a serious look at offering an early retirement
package before considering layoffs or furloughs. With the budget cuts
that are being considered agencies are having to look at reorganization
so this would be a perfect time to offer early retirement packages. It
seems that furloughs and layoffs would have even further negative impact
on NC economy due to loss of income and/or jobs whereas early retirement
would have less of a negative impact.

Sincerely,

Wendy Mann
