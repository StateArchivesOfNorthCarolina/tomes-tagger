The Honorable Beverly Perdue

Governor for this Great State of North Carolina,



First Governor, allow me to extend my congratulations to a most successful campaign. As you stated on many occasions, while campaigning across this state; ìIt takes all of us to make it work.î



While your tenure has only begun, it is truly refreshing to see you come out in favor of an open and inclusive government as exemplified in the January 14th Raleigh News and Observer article ìThatís an orderî.î Perdue also signed orders to post state grants and contracts on a central Web site. That's another good public access idea, along with town hall meetings, four of them, during her term. And Perdue was consistent in her campaign in vowing to open state records and conduct business in the open, which wasn't always the case with former Gov. Mike Easley.î



It is very frustrating when one knows of a true injustice and canít seem to get anyone to just look at it unbiased. This is especially true, when considering our present economic state of affairs. Fulfilling the need list should always prioritize the wish list of special interest.



Governor Iím attaching some points for study on my concerns; I truly recognize how busy you are but strongly feel this is deserving of considerations and study by your task force. Please donít hesitate to contact me if I can answer any question or be of service in any way.



Respectfully,



Steven F. Shell

Dear Governor Purdue,

We need your help.

Below is a msg to Commissioner †Mark Jones outlining a most severe problem in Jackson County
and the surrounding areas; Lack of high speed Broadband.
Also my response to Ron Masssingale at Balsam-West below that.

Balsam-West has the Fiber in the ground already in several areas, but lacks the funds to hook up small businesses and private homes.
I spoke with Balsam-West,†owner of the Fiber cable, installed from Sylva to Cashiers, NC ., funded by Private monies yesterday.
Ron Massingale Vice President†of Sales & Marketing,† BalsamWest FiberNet, 704-896-3666

He stated that his company simply can not afford to hook up businesses or private homes along the route of

of their fiber cable due to the high costs of doing so and not being able to show a return.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I apologize for this informal note, but I have a daughter with brain injury I am caring for, because the state and federal government has failed us both and added to this failure is the
fiasco with Albemarle Mental Health.

Anyway, that's why I don't have time to get formal, but I would like to meet with someone on your staff about what I KNOW will save the state in long-term health care costs and even with child developmental/educational issues.

I work as a nutrition specialist who monitors many home daycare providers who participate in the USDA food program.† As a result, I know about the indoor air quality in these homes, and though I have been nagging providers to give up a lot of their toxic air polluters, I believe the state can get more involved.

I WAS pleased to learn that the state DID just send out a brochure to home daycare providers on this topic, HOWEVER, it falls short and it WHIMPS out, to put it mildly, on use of volatile pesticides in places where children are exposed.†

Also it falls short on the subject of laundry products.† I go into homes that are so INUNDATED with fumes from scented detergents, fabric softeners, and dryer sheets, that first, I have to change my clothes so I won't get sick in my own car breathing fumes my clothes absorbed in a short† visit, and second, the multiple exposures I get in a day can give me a sinus infection and literally affect my brain -- I cuss or act inappropriately when I am exposed to too much PETROLEUM-BASED scents.

Now, imagine a child in that daycare, not only breathing the fumes in the home all day, but also imagine if his parents use scented products on that child's clothes and other parents in the daycare do the same.† People get used to these smells and don't even realize how strong they are to those who don't use them because they breathe them all day.

I just left a home where two providers are suffering from sinus infections, and their homes reek of these synthetic perfumes!

I know it will take some time to get through to people and there will be opposition from the manufacturers.† But I also know that they have their hands dirtied by their involvement in pharamaceutical mfg., and they have a lot to GAIN by making toxic products like GAIN.

I don't believe the Gov't should be a gestapo, but when the gov't and taxpayers are paying for sick children who don't do well in school because their brains are fogged and their noses are clogged by the inundation of SYNTHETIC petroleum-based perfumes, then it seems the gov't would want to educate them about these hazards as they would about lead, cigarette smoke and mercury, unless of course, as in the case with these poisons in the past, business interests have outweighed those of public health.

I will not charge you or the state a penny to sit down with you or someone on your staff and tell you what I know about this issue.

Though I am glad that the state has made a state with the recent brochure on the eco-friendly home, I feel that it should do a follow-up, explaining the effectiveness of BORIC acic and other NON-VOLATILE approaches to pest control and the HAZARDS OF THE SPRAY METHOD -- rather than telling them MERELY to follow label instructions on pesticides --THIS IS REALLY LAME.

And the follow-up should included info about the need to use FRAGRANCE-FREE LAUNDRY PRODUCTS IN THE DAYCARE AS WELL AS ON THE CLOTHES OF CHILDREN WHO ATTEND.

I think also that the state should look at the use of white vinegar and hydrogen peroxide as a safe and effective disinfectant and eliminate the use of bleach for this purpose AND any product that contains synthetic fragrances.

I can give you many more details about the health hazards of pesticides and toxic or perfumed products, as well as safer alternatives -- not just ones they have to make themselves.

NC should start a state-wide program of education and regulation on these products and pass on the info to the office of the President as well.

I sent a note earlier about the need to open cafes in remote areas of the state where they have nowhere to eat other than the local convenience or gas-station stores. And about the many poor families that live in the midst of pesticide-sprayed farmland.

State of the State Address

Governor Perdue will address the state from the North Carolina House Chamber on Monday evening at 7pm.† She will discuss the challenges facing North Carolina and her plans to move our state forward during these tough times.

You can watch the address live online at <http://www.governor.state.nc.us>http://www.governor.state.nc.us.†


Governor Signs First Bill into Law

On Wednesday, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/post/2009/03/04/My-first-bill-signing.aspx>Gov. Bev Perdue signed a bill into law that lays the foundation for her major restructuring in education leadership.† Senate Bill 198 is the first piece of legislation signed into law by Gov. Perdue.† The act modifies the restrictions on service on the State Board of Education by allowing a second North Carolina public schools employee to serve on the State Board.† The new law enables the governor to restructure and streamline North Carolina‚Äôs education leadership and allows Dr. Bill Harrison to serve both as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the State Board of Education.††

‚ÄúThis new leadership structure will bring a clear line of accountability and efficiency for moving North Carolina‚Äôs public schools forward,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúOur schools can be the best in the nation and I believe these changes will lead to students who become an innovative, well-educated, well-trained workforce of tomorrow.‚Äù


Governor announces DOT decision-making reforms

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue announced the new professional decision-making process for the N.C. Department of Transportation as called for in <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>Executive Order No. 2, which she signed on her first day in office.† The new process transforms the approval process and will improve efficiency, openness and make decisions more strategic. Under the reform initiative, NCDOT professionals will determine project priorities based on data and input from local government and planning groups.† The appointed N.C. Board of Transportation will set transportation policy.

‚ÄúThis new professional decision-making for transportation projects aims at taking politics out of the process,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúThe new process will increase accountability and openness and ensure that transportation projects are prioritized appropriately.‚Äù

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>On Jan. 12, Gov. Perdue issued Executive Order No. 2 as part of her first day of change orders, which required Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to implement a professional approval process for highway construction projects within 60 days.† The order also directed the Board of Transportation to delegate the Secretary authority to award highway construction contracts.


Governor appoints†policy leadership team

This week Governor Perdue announced she is appointing Al Delia as Policy Director and Mike Arnold as Deputy Policy Director.

‚ÄúAl and Mike will form a fantastic team,‚Äù said Governor Perdue. ‚ÄúTheir in-depth knowledge of North Carolina policy will serve as an asset to my office and to our state.‚Äù

Mr. Delia has over 20 years of experience in working effectively with boards and advisory groups and collaborating with diverse sets of workforce, economic development and educational organizations.† Before accepting the position as policy director, Mr. Delia, 48, served as president and CEO of North Carolina‚Äôs Eastern Region Development Commission. In this role he oversaw plans for business recruitment, retention, expansion and creation for a 13-county region. Prior to his work at the Eastern Region Development Commission, Mr. Delia spent†20 years working in economic development for North Carolina‚Äôs University System.

Mr. Arnold, 37, served as policy director in the Office of the Lieutenant Governor since 2005. During this time he worked with members of the NC General Assembly, advocacy groups and organizations, constituents and other federal, state and local stakeholders to help the Lieutenant Governor implement her policy agenda. Mr. Arnold was directly responsible for researching and developing policy initiatives for the Office of the Lieutenant Governor.

†Congratulations on winning the Governor's race and for the honor of being the first female Governor of North Carolina. I know you are very busy right with just starting this position and with the economy so I am going to make this a brief note. Around where we live in Reidsville there are not a lot of available jobs. Some of my family and a few of my guy friends are looking for full time work with some security. A few of them have put in applications with the state to hopefully gain employment with one of the correctional facilities near us. That a secure job. There will always be prisons.†We know because of friends that work in the one in Yanceyville, that they need officer help bad. My question is do you think the freeze on these jobs will be lift anytime in the near future? This will fill positions that are there and available and will get a few more people back in the workforce and in full time jobs and off the unemployment line like the President, You and all of America is striving for. Thank you so much for your valuable time and waiting to hear soon when this freeze may be lifted. Again Thank you very much.††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††† Angela Owens

Greetings,

I am sending along two letters which should be brought to the attention of the North Carolina State Legislature.

I have tried e-mailing my representatives, but I am not receiving much in the way of responses and nothing in the way of action.

I think that both issues are pressing and deserve real change.

Please let me know to whom these letters are sent on in the Legislature.

Thank you,

Dear Madam Governor and Local Representatives:

I am an Alternate Representative to the Senior Tarheel Legislature, FYI.† I am trying to get to the bottom of a Property Tax Relief rejection under state law ( G.S. 105-277.1) for a 91 year old Senior Citizen who has lived in the town of Graham, North Carolina at the same location since 1940.†
A Ms. Kim Horton is the administrator an per her is rejecting this seniors' appeal based on page 2 of 4 of the G.S. 105-277.1 quote " Adjusted gross income as defined in section 62 of the code", I would appreciate knowing what or how I get to this Section 62.
Her total income comes out to approx $100 less than the cut off .† Her CPA stands by her 1040 as being correct with a $ 1919 Capitol Loss for the year.† I believe she is receiving a refund from both the state and the federal government for lack of excessive income.
Ms Horton has disallowed her relief on the grounds that her loss for the year does not matter.
Please let me know how I can access this Code 62, what the proper channels of a appeal are, and who in the State Government that is knowledgable about this law.
Maybe, as elected officials its time to look at some of the technical aspects of this law an see if they are applicable to 91 year old ladies who was born in a depression and may very well pass on in a depression.† I'm sure if you just look around you in our state you'll find quite a few seniors just trying to hang on to their† dignity and their homes in these trying times.

Governor,

One of the great unheard of costs in the mortgage foreclosure problem is the uncontrolled and unregulated legal fees imposed on homeowners in North Carolina during a foreclosure process. While it may be possible for a homeowner to work at catching up on their regular mortgage payments, they will often get hit with massive legal fees.

In fact, the legal fees charged during a NC foreclosure process don't even truly match up with the NC Attorney's Code of Conduct, which basically states that fees be reasonable and relate to the experience of people doing the work, i.e. if a legal secretary prepares a filing, don't charge full attorney legal fees.

I know from first-hand experience how onerous and unfair these fees can be. I went through a foreclosure on a property i owned in Charlotte. Due to various circumstances beyond my immediate control I fell behind on the payments. I was actually able to come up with all the payments and legal fees due two days before the foreclosure date. I called the mortgage company to tell them I had the funds, when †they told me there was now "another $2000 in fees to pay". obviously I was unable to come up with that additional amount in two days and lost the property.

I called the mortgage company and asked for a breakdown of the fees being charged for the foreclosure - remember I am being billed these. They told me that they could not provide them and i would need to call the attorney;'s office directly and ask them. After numerous attempts to track down exactly who at the Attorney's office I needed to call, I asked them directly for a breakdown of the fees being charged. The response was that was between †them and the mortgage company and I needed to ask the mortgage company.

Hah!

Isn't it amazing that the people being billed for legal fees that may cause them to lose their home are not provided with any details as to what those fees are. Just a total amount that must be paid - or else. If you, as Governor, don't want to require reasanable limits on those fees, ast least it would be fair to require the mortgagors to provide a detailed bill of what they are charging for! Isn't that a reasonable request?

What's really amazing is that the state of North Carolina doesn't care.

South Carolina mandates a maximum amount on the fees that can be charged as part of a foreclosure proceeding. The amount is reasonable.

Why doesn't North Carolina?

If you want to do something to really help North Carolina homeowners suffering through a foreclosure proceeding, you will investigate this.
I look forward to your reply.

Sincerely,
Martin Bartlett.

I have attached all that I feel is important for you all to understand why I am writing this email.† My main concern is that the EOG's have TOO much power.† They have the power to retain a child...even if the child is an A or an A/B student.† I know that one would argue with me on that point, but if that isn't true then how come a parent and or teacher has to go before a school board and plead that students case in order for him/her to move to the next grade.† Then the ultimate decision falls on the principal, who hasn't even seen your child perform in a classroom situation.† So, really EOG's do hold a lot more power than anyone will admit to.† When I addressed this issue to Mrs. McManus she told me that the EOG's were just a "snapshot" of what the student could do.† If that is true, why are we spending so much money "snapshotting" our students when really that should be the task of the teacher who is with that student each day.† Testing is costing a fortune.† Money could be saved (and a lot of it) if we would put our money back into the teacher's classroom and allow him/her to teach.

I talked with Sara McManus this past Friday, only to learn that the reading†EOG questions have "distractors" placed within them which completely leads our students away from making a correct choice.† Also, she said that there are 2 good answers, but only 1 is the best.† I have a problem with that due to the fact that my son's experiences differ from other students experiences.† I feel that we are setting up our students across NC for failure by making the test so abstract.†† Here is something that someone needs to do.† Look at the current students that made a 1 or a 2 on the EOG 2007-2008 and current pre-EOG scores, compare that score with their classroom ability...many you will find are honor roll students.† Take a look at the money that NC spent on testing and retesting these students (many who were honor roll students)and then factor into that the cost of summer school.††Would it not behoove†us to allow†the teacher to discern whether a student should take the test two times? This could save NC a lot of money.† Many of our third graders, this year, didn't pass the pre-EOG...and yes, some were even in the advanced learning classes.† Shouldn't that be looked into instead of blowing it off and thinking that our teachers are doing a poor job?

I spoke with Mrs. McManus regarding why students do not take the CAT.† She said it was a very concrete test...different from the answer you will see given by the†NCGA staff.† They said it was because teachers were teaching to the test...what do they think teachers are doing now?? Teachers are teaching to the test more so now than ever.† She told me the reading †EOG is set up for higher order thinking.
I have asked Mrs. McManus to consider making a fair EOG...the reply was that we need to get our students ready for the 21st century.†I suggested that 1/2 of the test consist of concrete thinking and the other 1/2 consist of higher order thinking.†It's all about 'higher order thinking' which when all things are considered most adults have problems with that concept.† I would like to challenge you to find an EOG test booklet and look closely at the reading.† Most psychologists will tell you that higher order thinking is a skill for college age students, not elementary, middle, and high school.†

We are looking at a society of young students, dependent on anxiety and depression medications, because our testing has made them feel inadequent; therefore they drop out of school and do not become a productive citizen.† What if the DPI had to pay for the medical bills for students that are currently on anxiety medications due to testing?† I bet then they would rethink how the EOG should be set up.† It seems that no one is able to give me straight answers.† I talk to one person who tells me to talk to someone else who shifts me over to another person.† If we want young men and women to get a higher education or become productive citizens,†we must ensure that our teachers can teach something other than the test.† We are dumbing down our students daily by all of this 'global competitiveness' †jibber jabber.† We are always going to need plumbers, electrians, garbage collectors, landscape businesses....we all are not called to be rocket scientists.† We are trying to put our students into a mold instead of allowing them to pursue their calling in life.

So, why do I continue to write our†Senators and Representatives?† My son took the†EOG last year (2007-2008).††Up until this point he had scored a high 3 in reading, but†once the criteria for grading the test was changed his score dropped to a 1.† He is an A/B student and his current average in language arts is a 97.† He is sitting in remediation with 21 other students who are also A, B, and C students.† Something is terribly wrong with this picture. It's not just the school my son attends but across the county and extending into surrounding counties.† How can this many students be so low when just the year before they were on the 3 and 4 scale†of the EOG?††I should interject here that I recently paid for my son to take the CAT test.† He scored in the 91% percentile.† He is not†below average†as would the EOG score represent.†I made him take it to prove a point.†What point, you may ask.† I want someone to see that my son is capable and intelligent and the EOG scores were incorrect on scoring his ability.†

Why are those in the DPI so resistant to hear the voice of parents and educators?† I hold a master's degree and desired to continue my education because I saw and still see learning as fun.† How many students find learning fun?† Not many. We are sucking the life out of our teachers by not allowing them to teach and to use scare tatics about job security, †meeting AYP goals and percentage of students in their classroom to pass the EOG.† We have already sucked the life out of many students..look at the drop out rate.† Students don't†care because the test is too hard for them.††Does the DPI realize that presently their are schools where the principal has gone to all 3rd-5th grade†teachers and told them NOT to teach anything other than reading and math until EOG's are finished. †Does that tell you all something about how much pressure our teachers are under?†

Please let me know who will listen to the voice of parents and educators.† We deperately need the EOG's to be revamped.

Thank you,
Nancy Umberger

First of all what is the purpose in the bill to change the position of Superintendent of Public Instruction to an appointed position instead of an elected position?† Do you not have confidence in your constituents and who they elect into office (do you think you‚Äôre there by mistake)?


As I have written many times ‚ÄúALL‚Äù state employees should be treated the same.† If we are in such a deficit why does June Atkinson have someone doing her job making twice what she does?† Why was Britt Cobb who was eligible for retirement asked to stay on with state government with a salary increase for him and his wife Ann?

Why was Linda Coleman appointed to Commissioner of OSP only if Governor Perdue ‚Äúmet Ms. Coleman‚Äôs salary requirements‚Äù? These decisions were made knowing the budget crisis we were in.



In my opinion one of the best ways to help the budget is to start working for your state and forget the good ‚Äòol boys and girls program.† All of that has gone on too long, that‚Äôs a part of why we are where we are.



Force people eligible to retire making over 85,000 to retire and give those making less an opportunity to make more.



Investigate your HR depts., are people who deserve promotions really getting them or is politics in the way?† Why doesn‚Äôt a person loyal to a dept. with outstanding evaluations mean anything anymore?† Our current generation expects to get paid a whole lot for doing very little, is that the example our culture truly needs?† You should get what you deserve based on your work and your ethics not who you or somebody in your family knows; how fair is that to the ‚Äúcommon‚Äù voter?



My sister-in-law teaches Spanish I & II in high school.† She was telling of an instance in her Spanish II class where she had played a video in French and it took her class about 20 ‚Äì 30 minutes to figure out it was French instead of Spanish; what does that say for her teaching abilities.† Yet every year she gets more of an increase than I do.



Now the biggie, our health plan.† If there are so many financial problems with our health plan then it seems as though someone way up the food chain (you know the one‚Äôs, making the big bucks ‚Äì over $35,000) is not doing their job.† But state employees are going to be penalized for that.† We obviously need a better shopper and negotiator for our health plan since BCBS has made such a profit just on state government.† But lower waged state employees should not be penalized for higher waged state employees not doing their jobs properly.† As for the issue about people overweight and smokers paying more for insurance coverage, talk about DISCRIMINATION, oh my God.† How ludicrous..



I look forward to hearing from each of you personally and how you plan to take care of the people who put you in a decision making position.

Dear Governor Perdue:

Current NC unemployment has reached 9.7%. †It will probably go higher.

In 2007 I chaired our countyís Blue Ribbon Committee on Illegal Immigration; a somewhat feisty experience, to put it mildly. †However, a good deal of learning occurred for all involved.

Some of the information included the fact that even though agricultural jobs were advertised, there were few if any applicants. †This happened in our county when unemployment was 3+%. †It also happened in California as documented by Senator Feinstein. †And a Princeton professor wrote that even at $25/hour there would be a paucity of applicants from the US native labor pool (and at much higher wages more farming, and therefore farming jobs, would move OUT of the USA!). †In addition, a minister on our committee reported that in counseling unemployed church members, those folks confessed that they would rather stay on unemployment (and in some cases moonlight) than work for around $12.00/hour.

HOWEVER, we are in different times with unemployment 3 times what it was 2 years ago. †Therefore, I urge you make every effort to assure that all so called low-skilled jobs, including ag jobs, are posted early through the stateís Employment Security Offices so that our NC US citizens have first crack at them. †I also recommend your office give full publicity to this action.

We will see how many unemployed (especially white collar) workers sign up to pick crops, clean motel rooms, etc. during these trying times. †Iíd love to be surprised. †

Frankly, even in these trying times, I believe there is a need for a guest worker program that meets market demands and is better administered. †But, Iím very willing to be proven wrong.

Sincerely,

Bob

I can not believe that your office is cutting the budgets on the school system!† If the set budget was not enough, we have the "NC EDUCATION LOTTERY"..† That should fund the schools, right?† Where is this money going?† I know for a fact that the school system can, at its current enrollment rate, still use a few more good teachers!† I do not want my children going to a school that I plenty of taxes for, with inadequate staffing.† Is there going to be 35 kids in a classroom now??† With no TA's?† seriously, Im asking...?...† If I am way out of line I would love an explanation as to why this is being done..

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am very disappointed that your administration and the Division
of Air Quality have accepted Duke Energy's request to reclassify
the Cliffside coal plant expansion as a "minor" source of
pollution. This pollution permit could allow Duke Energy to
avoid compliance with the Clean Air Act.

This is also not in line with your campaign pledge last year to
make North Carolina a leader in clean energy.

RE.: Prison Closure Proposals


Dear Governor Bev Perdue,

††††††††Almost 27 years ago I left Germany and arrived here in the United States of America with my most priced possessions packed in to one suitcase†and I have lived in North Carolina ever since.† I am a single mother of two beautiful children, which attend UNC Charlotte and Methodist University.† My life has not been easy and I lost my first born to SIDS almost 28 years ago.†I had to work hard for what I have now and I also had to†struggle to be able to hold on to it.† My husband abandoned us in 2005 after 18 years of marriage without a plausible reason and he made sure to clean out the bank accounts and take all the kids college money as well.††I raised my son and daughter to be law abiding citizens and to study hard to be able to make something out of their lives and to contribute to society by helping others.† I†attended Fayetteville Technical Community College†and by†the end of 2005 I had earned two†associates, one in Paralegal Technology and one†in General Education but since my husband abandoned us and left us penniless I had to take the first job that was available to have some income coming into my household and† I started working for the Department of Correction, McCain Correctional Hospital, as of April 16, 2006.††I first worked as Medical Records Assistant III and I moved up to Office Assistant†IV†within one year.†I work hard everyday and in the 21 months in my new position I have covered my old position for more than 8 months†for various reasons and I have also trained two new employees in this position as well† and without ever getting any†additional compensation.†I believe in teamwork and I am a team player and a hard worker that helps anyone in†need of assistance and to keep†the workflow going to accomplish the departments day-to-day operations and mission of the department.† All in all, I take pride in all the work that I do†because what I do
does not only reflect on the people and†the department I work for but it also reflects on me.††I know I have much†more potential†than to work for the NC DOC but it is not easy to find a good job in North Carolina without having certain connections that others seem to have.†

††††††††Now we are slated to be closed and morale at McCain is very low.† Most workers here are minorities, women, people of different national origin, most are older than forty, and we have many single parents as well.†††The other facts†are that most employees here†only have a High School Diploma and†some do not even have that and the income of DOC employees is the lowest†pay†of all State Departments and most†have to work second jobs to be able to make ends meet. †All of us are devastated†and scared†and there is a great fear that we will not be placed in other state positions and that therefore our†children will suffer.† The fear of being unemployed and of losing our homes and not being able to take care of our children is more than we can bare.† We do not understand why we are being slated to close while monies are being paid to six figure positions on the top of the hill and other monies are being made available for, Goodyear incentives, probation, community college staff and faculty raises, and teacher ABC raises while we will be losing our lively hood.† The†Federal Stimulus†Package†is, and†was, supposed to save†and/or create 105,000 jobs, and not to shift money†around by eliminating†positions to create new ones for†people with degrees.† As†aforementioned, most employees at the NC DOC do not have any degrees beyond high school and therefore will be disadvantaged and not qualified to apply for the newly created positions.††DOC employees are the lowest paid State Employees and the least appreciated ones and we have been overlooked by our†government and the General Assembly for years.† As comparison†take a look at the† Office Assistant†IV pay at†DOC†that never even reaches the median of the pay scale, even for employees that have worked for DOC for more than 20 years, whereas an Office Assistant IV at†the Department of Crime Control and Public Safety makes the†max salary to the last dollar of the maximum range available, even for new employees.†Where is the equity and fairness in that? †To work in a prison is dangerous and stressful and†employees have†to be aware of their surroundings at all times.† As said before, we feel singled out and we feel unappreciated and we feel as the sacrificial lamb,†not due to the budget shortfall but to shift†money around from the jobs we will loose to some other newly created positions for probation and so that other state employees in the educational fields can receive raises.† How can that possibly save any money?† How will State Government attract good employees in the future when the ones it has, and that are faithfully serving, are being tossed to the side when the going gets tough, and are ignored when the going is good?

††††††††We know that you have to make many difficult decisions but†we would like to know what will happen to us, the Department of Correction employees, that will be laid off when you will close McCain Correctional Hospital and all†the other employees of the smaller prisons that are on the Closure Proposal List?††We feel that the Reduction in Force letter that we will receive will be just a piece of paper that is of no value.††We are†wondering why†you are†creating all these new jobs that most people that will be laid off will not be able to obtain because they do not have the education to qualify for these positions?††Could we possibly be trained and be sent to college†by the state to be able to apply and to be able to feed our children and keep our homes or will we end up on the welfare†list and in homeless†shelters?† Most†DOC employees live from paycheck to paycheck and have no savings.† So please think of all the families and†especially†the children you will be affecting with your decisions.† My children would have to drop out of college if I loose my job and therefore all the things you are trying to do for†education will not be of any help to them and I am quite sure that the same would apply to many other children of DOC employees that you are planning to cut.† What is education made available going to do good when you†have no time to be able to get educated because you cannot afford it because†you have no time and have to work two jobs just to get by?† I, for my part, would love to go back to†college to†work toward my bachelors degree but I can not because I do not make enough money†to put my†two children and myself†through college at the same time.††You see, my children are all I have and they come first, for they and their future are my main priority, but when I loose my job I can not even take care of†their future†anymore.† Please think about how you will affect all these children by laying us off, since children and education seem to be your main priority†such should include the children of DOC employees and their future as well. ††

Cordially,

I am reading the book and have just watched a one-hour Discovery
Channel special called Earth: The Sequel. They present an
inspiring vision of America's green energy future and the
technologies that will get us there.

I urge you to watch the show, read the book, and support these
green energy technologies.

To fully unleash our green energy future, we need to cap
America's global warming pollution. This will create huge new
economic incentives to rebuild our energy infrastructure, put
our citizens to work and liberate America from the dependence on
fossil fuels.

I encourage you to support a market-based cap on America's
global warming pollution to put more Americans to work
unleashing our clean energy future.

Dear Honorable Governor Perdue,

I knew there was a good reason to vote for you, and your recent announcement on changes to the probation system is a real concern of mine!!!† Obviously it is to you too, and I am so thankful.

I know of a particular parolee who is laughing at the system, and it just infuriates my husband and me to no end.† I have documented his life of crime and the dispositions, and would welcome a sit down conversation with you to share what I have learned.† I don't blame anyone for the fault in the system, but, knowing there's a way to fix it, I would be excited to be a part of the change.† What I've learned could possibly help other agencies as well, i.e., Department of Social Services, etc.† Our story is intense, and it needs to be heard by those who are looking to make a difference in this area.

I have sent short emails to Jon Williams, and to Mrs. Hayes executive secretary, Marilyn Doster, requesting an invitation for communication on this matter.† I hope you will take advantage of what we have to share, and look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,

Dear Gov Perdue,
Please do NOT cut any State jobs.  Everyone is struggling, so please look at other ways of fulfilling the budget requirements and needs.  

PARKING - Employees can start paying to park at their work places, or start paying a little more than they do now.  Perhaps that can bring some revenues to the state.

4-day Work Weeks - For a while, let's just have 4-day work weeks where we can.  Let employees have an adjustment in their wages to reflect reduced work hours.  NOBODY that I've talked to wants ANYONE to lose his or her job; every employee is receptive to taking a cut.  If buildings do not have power on, heating/air on for ONE day a week, that could save some money.

Of course, the ones at the poverty level and below should NOT be subjected to a cut.  

ENCOURAGE employees to retire if they are eligible.  A pay cut will be an automatic encouragement since they would NOT want their benefits reduced since the benefits are based on the highest 48 months of service, generally the last 4 years.

GREED - Eliminate greed - some positions can do with a little less compensation.


I myself chose to retire in January 2009 to allow someone to be employed, because I thought I could do with a little less; of course, I lost a lot of my savings in the 401k and deferred comp plan, so I am hurting more than I thought I would.  But, ENCOURAGE PEOPLE who can do with just a little less to go ahead and RETIRE and then let the position be vacant until the economy improves.

Well, we'll see what your ideas are and your budget officers' ideas as well.
Thanks,
Bina

I didn't watch Earth: The Sequel, since I don't have cable.
Allegedly, this show presents an inspiring vision of America's
green energy future and the technologies that will get us there.

You might want to watch the show and decide whether to join the
effort to support these green energy technologies.

To fully unleash our green energy future, we need to cap
America's global warming pollution. This will create huge new
economic incentives to rebuild our energy infrastructure, put
our citizens to work and liberate America from the dependence on
fossil fuels.

The EDF would like you to support a market-based cap on
America's global warming pollution to put more Americans to work
unleashing our clean energy future. Cap-and-trade would provide
opportunities for new companies to employ hundreds and make
millions trading carbon credits, much like Enron did trading
energy futures. 

Perhaps a tax on GHG emissions, and a tax credit for achieving
the same result(s) without GHG emissions would work better. For
example, suppose we impose a $10 per ton of fossil carbon
emission tax. If companies that generate electricity on average
emit that ton of coal for every 2400 kwh generated, then a solar
plant that emits no C (as CO2) would get a $10 credit for every
2400kwh generated; an electric utility would have a net tax of
zero if it implemented carbon capture and sequestration on half
its generating capacity. When there is more zero emission
generation than emitting generation, the tax credit should be
divided proportionally, so that when (solar, wind, hydro) is
generating twice as much total power as fossil fuel, the credit
would be halved, making the program revenue neutral, and
automatically decrease as the nation moves to GHG neutral
economy.
The same analysis would apply for other GHG producing activities
such as cement manufacturing. For transportation, biofuels would
be reduced in price by credits to their producers, and fossil
fuels taxed reciprocally(on an energy content basis). When first
implemented, this program would not be revenue neutral, and any
excess of tax collected over credits given must be earmarked for
R&D of a carbon neutral economy and its infrastructure. The
ratio of tax to credit must be increased over time to force zero
emissions, or full credit for negative emissions (excess CCS,
biochar, reforestation, etc)should be maintained.

From: "Dan Nelson" <dannelson7@bellsouth.net>
Date: March 14, 2009 12:23:44 PM EDT
Subject: Guilford Correctional closing





Prisons are an unfortunate but necessary part of our landscape as a
society. 
I will admit upfront, to be one who sees them much more as a beginning
than 
an end.  I have volunteered in the NC prison system since 1992; first at

Sandy Ridge Correctional, then at Guilford Correctional since 1998 when 
Sandy Ridge closed, and in Central Prison with the Kairos ministry since

2000.  As anyone connected with prisons will tell you, the issue between

those who believe in compassion and forgiveness, versus those who want
to 
lock up criminals and throw away the key, is the purpose of prisons, not
how 
they work best.



It's really quite practical.  If inmates, through programs, and personal

interaction with volunteers, can begin to find moral grounding,
recognize 
their self-worth and purpose, and can seek opportunities to obtain and
keep 
a job, some pretty positive outcomes can occur.  First of all, they will

discover that 'citizens' are not the enemy, and some people actually
care 
about them.  Further, they will hunger to reenter society for 'good',
they 
will pay taxes, rather than consuming them, and the rate of recidivism
will 
decline.



For many years, Guilford Correction Institution, under the direction of 
Superintendent James Lacewell, has been a prison where their program 
enriches society, rather than just a place to hide our society's dirty 
secrets.  Numerous work release sponsors support the population,
resulting 
in men who are able to help support their families and/or pay the
financial 
debt of their sentence.  In addition, those on work release pay for
their 
own transportation and for room and board each month.  Finally, assuring

this system, more volunteer hours spent at Guilford Correctional than at
any 
other institution in the state.  It is the type of prison that our other

prisons should be.  Oak Ridge UMC is represented at Yokefellows,
Wednesday 
night services, and with the Community Volunteer program.



In 2001, there was an attempt to close Guilford Correctional; through
the 
efforts of many, it was saved and Alamance Correctional was closed.  In
the 
last 10-15 years, NC has closed ~35-40 prisons, each time further 
compressing the overcrowding.  It has again been proposed that Guilford
be 
closed, this time by the State (not DOC).  From the standpoint of our 
state's attempts at rehabilitation this is a very bad idea, but also,
what 
camp really has room for another 120 inmates?  What about our future as
a 
state?



I ask that you strongly support this institution.  Examine all the facts
and 
see if closing Guilford makes sense at any level.  I realize, like 
landfills, many people like to have prisons out of sight, but criminals
are 
products of the city, and city prisons are an opportunity for churches
and 
other volunteers to improve the quality of life right where they live,
and 
have the resources close at hand to do it.  Clearly the economy is
stressed, 
but don't punish a program that is contributing to the recovery, by
cramming 
its men into a situation where they will be surely be a drain on us,
from 
now until their death.  Thank you for your support of this very
important 
issue for Greensboro and our area.



Sincerely, Dan Nelson

I strongly request that you consider the legislation Julie Boseman and 
carolyn Justice have introduced to stay the beach plan increases.  
Public debate and plan development to minimize the economic impacts on 
our citizens need to be given high priority.  The burden of higher 
insurance rates need not be borne by coastal counties since hurricanes 
and other weather related catastrophic events damage inland counties 
with flooding, etc. sometimes more so than the coastal areas. 

It is imperative that you consider protecting us from future rate 
increases by FOLLOWING CURRENT RULES that are meant to protect our 
fragile coast line and the living things from shrimp to trees that in 
turn protect us by NOT ALLOWING MEGA MONSTER HOMES TO BE BUILT RIGHT ON 
THE WATERFRONT and then when they get washed away or damaged, we little 
struggling folks who play by the rules are expected to pitch in to pay 
for foolish building practices.  I encourage you to put the majority of 
your constituents first this time and tell the development lobbyists and 
insurance lobbyists that you are looking out for the majority of North 
Carolinians this time.  The proposed increase in insurance rates will 
ensure that some of us can no longer afford to stay in our homes.  In 
this economic environment, job one for our elected officials is to 
provide relief from the never ending taxing, rate increases, fees, etc.

Thank you.

I request you support fair insurance rates throughout the state of North Carolina insted of focusing on the coastal counties to raise rates so the more populated areas can get reduced rates as they contain more votes.

I have lived at Kure Beach throught three hurricanes with no damage yet Raleigh, has experienced significant damage as well as Tarboro area.† During hurricane Hugo the coast had little or no damage and Charlotte had extensive damage.† Yet Raleigh and Charlotte will get lower rates paid for by the coastal area.† I have no problem with ocean front properties having to pay due to their location but not those blocks off the ocean front.†

This is a test of fairness versus political pay backs.† I hope you will stand up for fairness.

Governor Perdue,

I have a question which needs addressing concerning Department of Corrections and the Department of Transportations pay increases. What are these two state agencies' always leave behind or are never given a sizable pay increase verses the NC Teachers. I come from a family of educators and I have seen first hand their increases. My mother retired in 2001 and 9 months later is became teaching again or what is called double-dipping and she makes the money. I have been a state employee for 11 years this april. First, as a housekeeper in the Housing Department at UNCP- Pembroke, I worked like a slave yet did not even make $19,000.00 annual. I tranfered to DOC in 2004 for more money and two years ago, some employees at UNCP recieved reasonable increases through a program called Career-banding and good for them.

†DOC and DOT employees are still wondering if their time will even come. Who will champion for those individuals who put their lives on the line day in and day out inside†prisons, while transporting inmates to appointments, on work details or road clean-up crews. Who keeps these undesireables/criminals where they have been placed away from society for†acts of wrong doing. Who†prevents the innocents from†being killed or assaulted ensuring a safe†environment inside the confinds of correctional facilities. We do, those who are called Correctional Officers. Some may not give it their†all daily†yet many others†try†to and succeed to do it the next day and day in and day out; keeping society and†even the Governor safe.†

This is not a difficult job to do but keep in mind it can be a deadly job. All who provide security or those who are part of the criminal Justice system have some or much more†degree of a dangerous job to do.

DOT has a dangerous type of job also. Not only are these men and women exposed to the elements; they also work with inmates of a†lesser classification (Minium custody level but still dangerous), in addition; they work in an unsafe environment (highways, roadsides, tunnels, bridges, and near waterways).

I understand that I must contact my legislature representatives of my district, the state†personnel office, and†my North Carolina congressman or congresswoman for an answer to this question.

The recession which the United States is currently experiencing is very bad and every state and federal agency is feeling the punch so I know DOC and DOT will feel the punch more now than ever before.†


Thank you for your time,

Governor Perdue:


What is your decision on the elimination of this program?† Hopefully, it has been to continue† this valuable program with the unemployment at an all-time high.† This program is needed for people to obtain certifiable job skills.



Thank you for your response.

Governor Perdue:

It was with great†disappointment to read in the "Charlotte Observer" about the possibility of eliminating the Apprenticeship & Training Bureau from the NC Department of Labor.† We feel that this is a very short-sighted decision with negative affects for the workforce development in Western North Carolina.† The Apprenticeship & Training Bureau provides an invaluable service to both employers and potential employees, especially in an area with a diminishing skilled labor force like Western North Carolina.† Western North Carolina is experiencing an increase in the high school dropout rate with Asheville City Schools experiencing a 10% jump this past year alone.† This increase could possibly be due to an inability to correlate the benefits of obtaining an education with also obtaining a job skill for the future.† This is where the support of a skilled workforce development program such as provided by the NC DOL Apprenticeship & Training Bureau is crucial to the revitalization of Western NC's manufacturing base.† Without a skilled labor force to offer, this area will never be attractive to potential employers for the relocation of their business.† Our hope is that you will re-consider this decision.† Western NC went without an Apprenticeship & Training Consultant for 3 to 4 years, but this was alleviated in 2007.† It would be most unfortunate to take a step backward in developing a much needed skilled labor force in NC by eliminating this valuable resource.

Sincerely,

††† I am a recreational fisherman living in Pamlico County (just changed my voting registration in Bayboro from Craven County).† I am distressed by the Marine Fisheries Commission's inability or unwillingness to serve as proper custodians of our marine resources.† My views are my own.† I speak for no one in particular, although I'm sure thousands of other NC anglers share my concerns.



††† Since the new saltwater angling license was made mandatory for fishing in coastal waters, a fee I am more than willing to pay, if the money is used wisely to protect our fishing resources, DMC has acted like we are bastard stepchildren of the fishing scene.† They remain totally committed to the commercial fishermen.



††† Carolina remains only one of two states still allowing net fishing for speckled sea trout and†red fish in coastal waters (in inland waters managed by the Wildlife Commission these fish are game fish) along with Mississippi.† I am disappointed that North Carolina would be mentioned in the same breath as Mississippi with regards to any laws, let alone modern game and fish management.† All states from Texas to North Carolina on our coast except for NC and MS afford the two species game fish status with no gill netting allowed.



††† This recent†news release pertaining to striped bass I use as an example of DMC's†nonsensical management that is an insult to any intelligent person.† If, as stated in the news release, striped bass remain unrecovered in NC waters south of the Roanoke, why increase the incidental catch of big spawning females.





STATE IMPOSES STRIPED BASS GEAR RESTRICTIONS



MOREHEAD CITY ‚Äì The N.C. Division of Marine Fisheries took action Monday to protect the striped bass brood stock in the central and southern waters of the state.



Division of Marine Fisheries Director Louis Daniel issued a proclamation that implemented a 6.5-inch gill net maximum mesh size limit in these waters to allow large, migrating females ‚Äì some reported to be as large as 40 pounds ‚Äì to †escape capture and continue to upriver spawning grounds.



While striped bass stocks are considered recovered in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Albemarle Sound and its tributaries, striped bass stocks are still depleted in central and southern waters of the state that run from Roanoke Marshes to the South Carolina state line.



‚ÄúWe have a joint fishery management plan with the Wildlife Resources Commission where we‚Äôre trying to rebuild a depleted stock,‚Äù Daniel said. ‚ÄúThese large female fish are considered to be the most productive spawners. It is a good sign that they are migrating up the rivers, but we need to let them spawn.‚Äù



Researchers estimate that a 16-year-old female striped bass (about 42 pounds) has the potential to produce 28 times the number of eggs that a 3-year-old female striped bass (about 4 pounds) can produce.



Daniel had issued a proclamation to increase from five to seven the numbers of striped bass commercial fishermen were allowed to retain in the central and southern waters of the state, with no mesh limit. The intent was to provide fishermen the opportunity to retain incidental catches of striped bass when fishing for shad and flounder. Instead, a few fishermen began targeting the larger brood stock striped bass with 8-inch mesh gillnets, typically used for ocean fishing.



‚ÄúFishing on these large, adult fish is contrary to the intent of the state‚Äôs fishery management plan,‚Äù Daniel said.



The N.C. Estuarine Striped Bass Fishery Management Plan can be found on the DMF Web site at <http://www.ncfisheries.net/download/StrBassFMP2004.pdf>http://www.ncfisheries.net/download/StrBassFMP2004.pdf.



At this point the proclamation does not impact recreational fishing. However, Daniel also advises recreational fishermen to not target or retain these larger fish. He said DMF is monitoring recreational harvests and further protective measures will be adopted, if necessary.††††††††††



††† Here is a state agency that, in my opinion,†is unresponsive to its constituents†.† In fact, many on DMC want the salt water license done away with so they can†totally ignore the recreational angler, except to†issue citations.



††† If you are interested,†I can provide information from the other†states along our Southeast and Gulf Coasts that have banned†gill net fishing in coastal waters.† The positive results for the resource as well as tax revenues and money spent by recreational fishermen on gear, tackle, boats, motors, lodging, etc. etc. are more than enough to convince most†objective people of the merits of a more sensible, rational and even handed approach to the management of our natural resources, including red fish, specs and stripers.



Basically, it is my hopes we can designate the red fish and speckled sea trout as game fish when in inland coastal waters, so they will be afforded the protection they deserve.† Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.†

I realize that in todayís economic conditions everyone is looking for ways ìto tighten their beltî.† In our homes, we have had to look for ways to cut our expenditures.† Our company, in an effort to maintain a strong, stable company has taken steps in advance of a crisis to cut expenditures.† I, for one, am thankful our top executives were bold enough to take these steps to avert financial problems in the future.



I worked for the NC State Government many years ago and the pay back then was not nearly as appealing then as it s now.† I also had my wages frozen for two years.† As a young inexperience worker, I felt the private world would better suit my needs.† I worked for thirteen years for a private company that eventually went bankrupt due to poor management.



Let me tell you about some of the cuts we have made locally that have affected 500 employees.† The maximum number of weeks we could earn was three weeksÖ..that has now been slashed to two weeks.† We have no sick paid daysÖyou take a vacation day if you are.† We also just had to take a 2.5% cut in pay and temporarily lost our 401K match.† These cuts may seem drastic, but I feel secure that my company will be viable within their balanced budget.



I have many friends and relatives that are employed and paid well by the State of North Carolina.† Most of these employees get five weeks vacation and better than two weeks paid sick leave.† In addition, I understand that if you retire as a state employee you donít have to pay North Carolina State income tax.† This seems a little out of place considering we are all being asked to tighten our belts.† Let us assume there are 5,000 employees at 40 hours vacation at approximately $20.00, if that one week of vacation were revoked, that alone would be a $4,000,000.00 savings.† Also, I donít understand why retirees should be afforded the luxury of no NC State income tax being dueÖ.you have thousands of people in this state struggling to pay their taxes for retirees to pay none!† This just doesnít seem exactly fair and equitable.



We have students graduating from college as trained teachers (some with their education paid for by the state) and we canít place them due to a hiring freeze.† Right here in my community we have had teachers and principals retire and come back to work as contract workers.† That is double dipping!† We have two new prisons built in the western part of our state ready to be opened, but with a hiring freeze we canít man them.† I guess we will be like California and cut the sentences for offenders to make room in our existing jails.†



These are just a few of my thoughts on our stateís current economic situation.† I wish you and your staff Godís wisdom while tackling these difficult times.† I want our state to continue to prosper and grow.† I have a son and I want him to know what a great state he lives in and can be proud of his roots.†





The opinions and suggestions are not necessarily endorsed by my company.

Dear Governor Perdue My name is Anthony Bradley and I received an e-mail from your office today concerning the programs across the state that you have proposed eliminating. This e-mail stated that you were shutting down 20 wasteful programs that were not needed. Governor one of the programs you have proposed to shut down in the Young Offenders Forest Conservation Program†better known as the†BRIDGE program†at Western Youth Institution in Morganton. Governor I know you are faced with a tough task this year in trying to balance our State budget in these trying times but I believe you are making a serious mistake if you eliminate this program. Ask any of your elected†Representatives here in the western part of North Carolina how valuable this program has been to our area during the devastating forest fires that come year after year. These young Offenders stay on call 24 hours a day 365 days of the year. I met with†you last summer when you stopped by the historic train depot in Marion NC. I was very impressed with you and worked hard with my local Democratic Party to help get you elected. I am sending you this e-mail to ask you to please reconsider your decision to shut down the BRIDGE program at WYI. Governor this is one program in the DOC that we can be proud of because it†works and provides a valuable public safety service for all of†western north Carolina. I know this because I am a Correctional Officer at WYI at the minimum custody unit†where these young inmates are housed†and I have seen how this program has changed the lives of so†many of the youth offenders enrolled in this program. I have seen first hand the pride in these young men when they return to the unit after saving a home from being burned to the ground. I wish you†could take†the time to come up to WYI one day and meet the staff and inmates that make up this program†before you eliminate it. Thank you for†your time.

Gov. Perdue:

I voted for you to help our state†especially†after hearing your campaign speech here in Marion, NC.† Now I'm beginning to wonder if you and the representatives in Raleigh really plan to help our region.† Budgeted†money is not†coming to Western North Carolina to help with the housing crisis (see information below).† I know there are not as many foreclosures in this region, due to†the difference in the†population†difference.† That doesn't mean Western North Carolina†doesn't need some funding.†††

Also, what is happening to help the struggling businesses?† Increasing the professional fees from $50 to $200 may not seem much to†you or†our Representatives, but for the struggling Realtors in the State of North Carolina (including Western North Carolina)†after paying their national, state and local dues and trying to living month to month waiting for each real estate†closing, it will be hard.†

Please try another way to raise money.† Cut some of the new positions you are forming.† Don't "full" staff your office in Charlotte.† Look for a cheaper place to rent and have your office.† It doesn't have to be in a million dollar setting.† Have the office where common working people will feel welcomed.††New positions formed†that "oversee" other people that are†"overseeing" other people making sure they do their job is wasteful?† Make the original people in the first set of "overseeing" people accountable.† If they can't do their job, send them packing and let someone else that is accountable fill their positions.†

Please think about this information and talk with people from small towns.† I'm not talking about politicial people from small towns, I'm talking about the working people.†

Thank you for your time.†

I am still an active 30 year employee of the Dept. of Corrections.  I have always been proud to be State Employee.  However, it seems that every time we turn around, their is another reason to try and reduce our pay checks.  The prison system is in dire need of more help, not less.  I am seeing that DOC is getting what it is paying for.  When you treat people as though you don't care about them, it is going to show in everything they do.  The system is going down fast and it is because we are underpaid and overworked.  Cutting staffing positions within the prisons themselves and cutting the pay of DOC personnel will only make this system worse.  Staff are stressing out because of being understaffed and underpaid and they feel as if the State does not care if they can't make ends meat.  The prison population is going to skyrocket and we need some help.  DOC custody staff feel second class to the inmates to whom they watch over.  This needs to change.   Staff who are on the lower end of the pay scale are suffering tremendously and can't afford for their insurance to keep going up.  They are either going to start abusing it since they are having to pay more for it, or they are going to wait until their health is so bad that it is going to cost the State more in the long run.  
    If a prison is adequetly staff and people are paid fairly then that in itself will stop alot of the costs associated with turnover, workmans comp claims and disability issues.  Staff are going to try everything they can to get on workmans comp and or disability.  The State can save millions by hiring enough good investigators and going after all these false claims.  They will pay for themselves and then save the State millions.  
    As far as mandatory furloughs; I am against them unless the cut off goes way above $30,000.  Another example of taking hard earned money from those State employees who can least afford it.
       
Thank you for your time!

Subject: Omnibus Public Land Act (H.R. 146)

Comment: This is a copy what has been sent out to help keep the right to self-defense. Just remember we are not sheep. Dear Representative: On Wednesday morning, the Omnibus Public Land Act (H.R. 146) will come to the floor. This bill, which has bounced between the House and Senate in recent weeks, has completely sidestepped the issue of my right to self-defense. Several pro-gun representatives tried to amend the bill so that it offers real protection of Second Amendment rights on National Park Service and Fish & Wildlife Service lands, but those efforts were defeated. Repeal of the NPS gun ban takes on added urgency after a federal appeals court issued an injunction last week to stop changes made by the Bush administration to allow concealed carry on NPS land from taking effect. And please don't be fooled by language that was recently added to the bill to protect hunting and fishing on certain parts of federal land, as if the Founding Fathers pledged their lives, fortunes and sacred honor to protect a recreational pastime. First, there will be a vote on Ordering the Previous Question. I urge you to vote "NO" on that motion, in order to allow for consideration of an amendment by Reps. Doc Hastings and Rob Bishop. The Hastings-Bishop amendment to repeal the NPS gun ban protects my right to self-defense on OUR public lands, and I urge you to SUPPORT it. Gun Owners of America will inform me of how you vote, and will rate the procedural vote and the vote on the amendment in its upcoming Congressional rating. Sincerely, Ray Ellis

Subject: Where does all the money go?

Comment: Ma‚Äôam, With most of North Carolina‚Äôs reserve vehicles in equipment deployed to Iraq over the last 5+ years, many of our units do not have equipment. The equipment we had has either been refitted and sold to the Iraqis or eliminated from our inventories. 1 - The active duty will have a vast number of MRAP series to refit their units, but how is the federal government going to refit your reserve and national guard forces? 2 ‚Äì I am not an economist or policy expert, but it seems strange that the American auto makers are not spearheading the development and production of military vehicles ‚Äì especially for smaller vehicles such as the HUMMWV or troop carriers. When did the United States stop serving as the primary producer of outfitting its defense force? Who will produce the repair parts for these vehicles? From what I have seen, NC is planning to take all of the stimulus offered from the federal government; and many of the stipulations will require a continuation of services and programs. Please read take time to dissect the lengthy document and identify what is best for NC for the long term; a program with limited federal funding seems like a NC problem down the road... higher taxes or a similar situation to the No Child Left Behind Act. Thank you for your time, Michelle

I just thought I would let someone in government know that is a very daunting task to get NC license plates. On top of the ridiculous paper work needed there is also a $217 fee attached to this process. I am not sure where or how that money is spent but to common sense it seems absurd. In addition to it all is the fact that the license office does not take credit cards, so in order to pay this fee I need a loan, and although I work 40 hours a week and have a steady job, the banks will not provide such a personal loan. This seems to be a typical case of the little guy getting worked over. Thanks for your time.

$56 Million for National Guard Facility

Gov. Bev Perdue announced†Wednesday that work will begin shortly on a $56 million new North Carolina National Guard Joint Force Headquarters facility that will also house offices of the state Division of Emergency Management, the State Highway Patrol and the Department of Transportation in Raleigh.† The project, which is expected to create up to 4,200 jobs, will be open to bids next week with work to start as soon as early summer and to be finished within two years.

In addition to the National Guard, the facility will provide the main offices for North Carolina‚Äôs Emergency Management division, communications for the state Department of Transportation and the triangle area communications center of the Highway Patrol.† About $41.5 million in federal funding for the facility was included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.† The remaining money comes from state general and highway trust funds that had previously been set aside for the project.

‚ÄúThis project is big a win for North Carolina.† It provides a state of the art facility that will better coordinate key state services and is ready to put people to work in much needed jobs,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said.

Securing money for this project was a top priority for Gov. Perdue, who personally discussed it with President Barack Obama and with North Carolina‚Äôs congressional delegation.† Fourth Congressional District Rep. David Price was instrumental in boosting the funding for the Army National Guard account in the federal recovery legislation.†

The new 237,000 square-foot facility will be located on an 18-acre site off of District Drive in Raleigh.† The existing facility will continue to be used by current National Guard offices now housed in temporary trailers.† Since September 2001, units of the N.C. National Guard have been continuously mobilized throughout the world.

The transition of the National Guard from a strategic reserve to an operational reserve requires more facilities to meet the increased service demands.† Also, bringing agencies that consistently work together under one roof, will streamline coordination and provide for more effective emergency response.

First Recovery Contracts Awarded

Work†will begin in April on the state‚Äôs first nine highway and bridge projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The contracts total $36.3 million and were awarded this week by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidders, as required by state law.

‚ÄúThese first road projects will create a wide range of jobs throughout North Carolina and can address some of our most pressing, ready-to-go infrastructure needs,‚Äù Perdue said.

The projects are located in Brunswick, Camden, Currituck, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Scotland and Stanly counties. Two projects, one located in Alamance County and one in Forsyth/Stokes counties, were let to contract on March 17 and will be awarded once the respective low bidders demonstrate that they have met ‚Äúgood faith effort‚Äù requirements in attempting to reach the disadvantaged business enterprise goals set forth in the contracts. The disadvantaged business enterprise goals were met or exceeded on the nine contracts awarded.

The bids received on all 11 economic recovery projects let to contract in March came in more than 19 percent, or nearly $15.8 million, below NCDOT estimates. Work on all contracts can start as soon as April 27, with the exception of the Currituck County bridge replacement project, which will begin after June 30th.†

According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation trickles down into the economy six times.

In addition to helping create jobs, the nine projects awarded will complete needed infrastructure improvements. They include four widening projects that will help improve mobility and reduce congestion; three construction projects that will extend key corridors and provide regional access; and two bridge replacement projects, one of which will replace the state‚Äôs fourth oldest bridge still in use.

†Speaking of Health Care, why don't you let the tax payers know exactly how much of their tax dollars are going to the Prenatal Clinics. Most people have NO idea the amount of money that goes to this. It needs to be reworked. Most of the taxpayers don't know how many illegal aliens that they pay for. There needs to be limits on the number of pregnancies that can got through the prenatal clinic.Why should we pay for baby number 5 or 6 of some young black girl with 5 or 6 different fathers??? This program encourages young girls to get pregnant. Their prenatal care is paid in full, their delivery is paid in full, they automatically get on welfare and food stamps. Probably help with housing. Get rid of the prenatal clinics. Stop encouraging them. Let the taxpayers decide if they want their tax dollars going to this program. You know what the result would be. NO! NO! NO!
On another note, I still find it implorable that YOU want to take away the longivity pay of state employees. This is backwards. If you work hard and do right, your bonus is taken away. If you do nothing get pregnant , we will pay for everything. This is just not† right. Get God back in our government and it will get better.
