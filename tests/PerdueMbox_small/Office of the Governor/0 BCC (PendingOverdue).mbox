	Message: 	Dear Governor Easley,

First, permit me the opportunity to again thank you and your staff for the prompt intervention in the matter of securing my retirement from the state retirement system. I did receive an immediate response from one of the workers with the retirement system regarding this matter. I apologize, but I cannot locate the written information regarding her name. However, I was informed that the process would take one to two weeks to complete. I forwarded this information to Wachovia, my banking institution to handle all processes.

Unfortunately, I must say that I am again puzzled and frustrated because the system is not, in my opinion, fulfilling its promise by professionally corresponding with the Rapid Rollover team at Wachovia handling this matter. I spoke with a Wachovia support representative on Wednesday, the 31st, after receiving a letter from the retirement system asking for written correspondence from Wachovia detailing the acceptance of the rollover. According to Jewnell Provoid, Wachovia Rapid Rollover Team Support at 877-386-2472, extension 058289, several sets of the same information as again requested by the retirement system was sent on 12/18,30,31/08. Fax confirmations were maintained about each correspondence between the two institutions, but the retirement systems continues to request the information again. I do not understand why there is this problem, and feel the retirement system is dragging to prevent the rollover. As stated in a previous email, it is urgent that I receive this money to keep my home.

Please intervene and help me. Feel free to contact me or Mrs. Provoid.

Thank you,
Shirley Vinson

Michael F. Easley
Governor of North Carolina

Dear Governor Easley:

I have always admired your opinion on the American family and the importance of freedom.

It is “Freedom” that I am requesting your assistance with in the matter of my husband, Danny Paul Dayberry (OPUS # 010400). He is currently an inmate at Gaston Correctional Center in Dallas, North Carolina. Danny is nearing the end of his 12 year 7 month sentence for a fatal automobile accident he was involved in and charged with vehicular murder. His release date is April 28, 2009. To many this may not seen to be of any significant amount of time, but to us we count every day as a blessing and being able to be share it with each other would be the best gift imaginable. I believe the importance of having a family and the simple things of life is becoming a vanishing part of American life.

Danny has been a model inmate with no infractions since 2/1999 which has made him able to achieve his level 3 honor grade, have CV passes, able to work off of the prison site with DOT workers while at Cleveland Correctional Center, and at the present time is working off prison site with the town of Bessemer City, be eligible for work release where he would be paid a working man’s wage ,but due to the economy and the lack of jobs available has not been able to find a job, and has been granted home passes since 9/2008. Danny is a hard worker and dreams of coming home to his family.

We are praying that you will grant his early pardon from prison. Thank you for your time. God bless you.

Sincerely,

Alicia C. Dayberry, RN, BSN

My wife recently lost her job as have so many others in this state. But to make the problem worse, when applying for unemployment online, she cannot get any type of confirmation that she has done it correctly and is even in the pipeline? And furthermore, we have heard from many others that it may be 10 weeks before she gets her first check. We have bills now! And the mortgage co, credit card companies, utility folks, etc are not going to wait for their money. Why is it that the government can work at ligh t speed to get hundreds of billions approved for big companies but you cannot cut a check for a few hundred dollars for hard working normal people? I know there have been many people applying for unemploymwent benefits but their performance is utterly inexcusable. We're hurting now. Please help "light a fire under them"?

Dear Governor Easley,

Today I attended the North Carolina Army National Guard 1-113th Field Artillery Alpha Battery's Deployment Ceremony. Representative Patrick McHenry send a personal representative, the Governor-elect send a letter, Senator Burr sent a letter also, but my dear Governor, you are the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF for the National Guard. Your lack of attendance or representation was reprehensible. This unit is the first National Guard unit to be sent in its entirety to a combat situation in Iraq TWICE, and their Commander-in-Chief was not there. President Bush, the U.S. Military's Commander-in-Chief, travels to Iraq periodically to thank the troops. Is Lincolnton, NC too far away?? We are not a combat zone here in Lincoln County. The disappointment in representation from our elected officials rippled through the audience in attendance. Our mayor, a former Alpha Battery Commander, did attend though. Perhaps you can send him a Thank You card.

Sincerely,

Sebrena Pearson

Attorney At Law
219 North Second Street

Telephone(910)2512273

Dear Mr. Solana:

I am writing this letter in the hope of obtaining some help, guidance and assistance in preventing the City of Wilmington from foreclosing on my mother’s home, Mary M. Wilson, 417 South 6th Street, on Tuesday January 6, 2009

I am the son of Mary M.Wilson, who died two years ago and would like to take the responsibility and enter into an agreement with you in order to prevent the home from being foreclosed. Medical illness, sickness, hospitalization and placing my sister in a nursing home would prevent them from enduring the past due amount of $22,000.

I really do not have all the answers, but it has torn my hear as I think about the death of my parents and now the recent placement of my sister in a nursing home because of Alzheimer, hospitalization of another my sister for a scheduled surgery and the current hospitalization of my brother in a nursing home because of other medical and physical reasons.

My name is Johnny L. Wilson. I am the third son of Mary and William E. Wilson and have been employed in the Department of Political Science at Clark Atlanta University for the past 21 years as a Tenured Faculty member. All I am asking is for hope, an opportunity a little time, a chance to raise the money or to give you access to my banking account whereby you can receive payments on the 30th of each month.

I guess, I ask these things in faith in the hope of appealing to you for help. I look forward to hearing from you. If you need to contact me, I can be reached at (404) 880-8245(W); 404 7635072(H) or by cell at (404) 2000699

On inmate Johnnie Gurley being released- I sent this to my senator and representatives this morning, also to NC Parole---
Gentlemen-I have a hard time believing that this inmate will be set free. The down right nastiness of his crimes should warrant that he does not ever walk the streets with mine and any other family again. As a taxpayer and voter I request that you or anyone that you know do something to keep this animal locked up. This release does not make sense. He is 66 and still capable of more horrors.

I currently own 15 properties in NC. I purchased these homes over the past 8 yrs. Since the BAILOUT I have been getting buried by lower rental income and decreased value. I can not sale the properties nor can I refinance them because I have over 4. I hear investors daily letting properties go in bulk because of this.
I may be right behind them because I have have no way to turn.

Can you tell me if anything in the BAILOUT is for the small investor and if so who I can call for help. I consider myself lower middle class as far as income goes and I was just trying to do better when I bought these properties. Just need help! Can you point me in right direction?

Thank you and God Bless

I recieved a NOTICE OF EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION back around the beginning of July 2008. I filled not sure if I was going to recieve anything cause I did have a job, but the letter said " DO NOT QUIT YOUR JOB" so i filled. I recieved three notices on July 21, 2008. Two, which said the name of my employer, Jimmie Williams, and they both said I had insufficient funds in my base period ( in only make $255.00 a month). So I took that as I was not going to recieve anything which was fi ne, but I opened the third notice and it said " you are monetarily eligible for EUC benefits". It explained how i needed to to start filing. When I looked up my case on the computer it said if further information was need they would contact me. Well after a week I hadn't been contacted so I started filing and recieving money, then in October 2008 I recieved a phone call wanting to verify things. Well its been almost 3 months of recieving money and they just now wanted to verify my info.
They lady on the phone said I had filed with my last job which was with Paper Pak. I didn't think I did but she seemed like she knew something so she told me to keep filing and I would recieve a letter letting me know if I was overpayed.
I recieved this letter, and it said I was overpayed $3,965. If I wanted to appeal then send the paper back in with APPEAL on it which I did, because after looking at all my paper work I recieved from ESC, Paper Pak was not listed as my employer, it was Jimmie Williams. I appeal that notice back in November 2008 and have yet to recieve any notice about my case. I have called all the numbers they gave me on the notices. I talk to no one, the lady who is suppose to handle my case according to the last 4 digits of my social security number is Patsy Williams. Her voice mail said as of August 2008 she is on Medical Leave, and it transfered me to the operator who I think the name said Gabriel Williams, his voice mail comes up and the mailbox is full. I can not get anyone to talk to me and help me out in this matter.
My problem is the ESC got my employers mixed up somehow cause who they say I filed under and the paper work I recieved from their office is two different things. So now I'm suppose to pay this money back. I only make $255.00 a month, I have a 2 1/2 year old who I am trying to take care of on my own, so there is no way I can pay this.
Please help me find who I need to talk to in this matter. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

My Claim is in Appeal - Gail H. Helms - 246-72-5764 - I have an e-mail below my e-mail from H.R. at Moore & Van Allen, PLLC - they are not opposing appeal (see below).

Personally, I think it would have helped me if they had submitted a response to my original application in October.

I am praying that my Appeal Claim will be approved.  I do have the disability of Panic Disorder.  The person who called me from the Unemployment Security Commission did not put anything in my Docket No. 38120 about me having a severe Panic Attack that day.  I told her I had a severe Panic Attack that day and quit my 8 year job with Moore & Van Allen - making $51,000 a year in 10 minutes using e-mails.  I have documented information with Moore & Van Allen re: Panic Attacks since 2002.

Gail,



If the Employment Security Commission initially denied your application for unemployment benefits, it would have been based strictly on the information you provided them.  We did not submit a response to your original application for unemployment benefits, and have no plans to oppose your appeal.



Best wishes.

Subject: I'm being discriminated, denying blocking my legal right.

Dear Sir/Madam,
I been discriminated so bad yesterday. here's the story of what happened.
I never applied for unemployment benefits before. Since I came to
America on 2005 mostly work 2 jobs.
On Dec19th the company I work at shut down and we all back on Jan 19.
So HR office at work told us that we all eligible for unemployment
benefits and they gonna file for us as attached workers..
I was checking online for my benefits at www.ncesc.com. then I didn't
find much information.
I decided to call the local office of Hendersonville NC.
finally It was me and the office manager on the phone. he said
Department of homeland security is blocking my benefits.
He said he want to see my Green Card and My social Security card personally.
I keep all my letters, W-2s, Income tax returns, and , extras. all in
a cartoon box.
So I grabbed the my box I headed to the branch in Hendersonville NC.
I met with the manager.
I grabbed my wallet to show him my Green Card, and social security card.
I found my Green card, but I didn't find my Social security card which
usually nobody asked my to show it.
He said that he can't give me my benefits til I show him my social
security card, Even though I didn't file for anything and everything
was filed by my job.
I memorize my social security number in my head.
I told him, Sir, here's my income tax return, here's my w-2s of 3 years.
Here's the social security benefits letter that sent to me every year
to show my benefits every year so far..
He don't want to change his mind...He don't want to give me my
benefits which all my co-workers are being receiving now and me not
yet.
I had to go to the local Social security Administration office to
apply for new one.
I applied, i had a letter that shows that I applied for a new one I
went back to the guy to show him this letter and he still saying I'm
sorry I want to see your social security card.
I left finally to the house disappointed.. I'm so broke.. I even tried
to find a job and couldn't yet.
Finally i came home I searched again for my social card
I found it. I had to go back to social security administration to
cancel the order of new one..
The guy told me it's OK, you don't have to cancel the new coming card,
and you still can keep the old social security card and it's valid.
I went back to the unemployment security commission office, and i show
him the social security card (he made a copy of both my Green card and
my Social security card )
and then he said OK. call me back on Friday.
friday is passed the paying day ???????????
I checked the state and the fedral laws..he has the right to see these
thigs,
but as long as he saw then he must process my benefits and don't delay
it or block it.
even if he want to run further checks on me.


I need your help.. NC state denying my benefits and rights..even
though i paid them tax for 3 years.
Please help.

To whom it may concern,

This letter is regarding Tutor Time center 6045 at 1720 J.N. Pease Place Charlotte 28262. My concerns are with the new director Sue Race that has been placed at this center. Several offensive racial comments concerning African Americans have been made. The current director Sue Race has stated that there will no longer be anymore African Americans hired because there is not enough diversity at the center which to my understanding is against the E.E.O.C act to even state. The new director Sue Race has hired two new caucasian teachers who have been placed over African American teachers who are childcare educated which has resulted to there hours and others to drastically be cut. Several staff members were given Barack Obama pins for the holiday season the comment was made by the director “I can’t believe ya’ll are wearing those things around”. The next offensive comment was concerning one of the African American parents who brought a child a pair of expensive gym shoes for the holiday season the current director made the comment in front of several staff members and two guest ”Those are some expensive shoes they must be hot from new york”. She has been made aware that her comments are offensive and nothing has changed. I can go on for hours about different comments that have been made over the past several months but I don’t feel the need to. These few comments alone show how detrimental this matter is. My real concern is this is someone who is an educator someone responsible for teaching and mentoring to our children. How can you open our children’s mind to a brighter futher when you yourself have a closed mind? An educator takes a solemn promise to make sure that the children they care for get the love and education they need. The reason I have chosen not to use the chain of commands is because this matter goes beyond the director. The Asst. Director of the center who is also African American was passed over for the director position even though she has a B.S. and special training in childcare the position was given to the current director who doesn’t have a degree or the necessary training that is needed for childcare. This matter is a major concern and I need to know how to rectify this very sensitive matter. I ask to whom receives this letter please be mindful that this is an educator of our children responsible for molding there impressible minds and looking out for there well being. I ask if you can’t treat your adult staff no matter what difference they may have with common courtesy and respect than how can you have common courtesy and respect for our helpless children. I thought the civil rights movement fought to end racism in America years ago. Thank you in advance for looking into this very important matter.

I dont know if you can help me, but any help at all would be greatly appreciated. I had been with a company for 5 years when we were outbidded by another company, and I was hired by the new company, and from the first day,it was a hostile working environment. The supervisor constantly yelled at me, made smart comments about me, then hired another guy to supposedly help me out, and then laid me off. I just need to know if someone could possibly help me figure out what to do. I have four kids, and my un employment is 200 dollars less than I make a week, so I really need my job what can I do? I already contacted the labor board and they said there was nothing they could do.

Dear Governor Easley,

I am writing this letter in hope that you will be able to help me. My name is Doua Chee Kong. I have been a resident of North Carolina since 1992. I am currently a student at Toccoa Falls College in Toccoa, Georgia. Spring 2009 will be my last semester. I will finally be graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Counseling Psychology. I will be the first in my famiy to graduate. The problem I am having is that once I graduate, I will have to begin repaying my loans starting in June. As Hmong refugees from Thailand, my parents were not able to financially support me in my education. As a result, I rellied on federal aids and many private loans. I must admit that I was not wise about taking out loans. Unfortunately, no one told me anything and I learned too late. Although I have accumulated such a high debt, my education  is something that I do not regret. It has formed me and mold me into a better woman. Although my education has been a great journey for me, I do not want to spend the rest of life's journey paying it back. Once I graduate, my debt will be approximately $100,000, after five years including interests. I am sure that I will be able to find a job and pay for my loans, but nothing else. I will like to attend graduate school too but not unless I have the funds to do so. Governor Easley, I need your help. Are there any programs that will help me with my debt? Are there grants available? If so, how can I apply? If there is anythig you can do to help me please let me know. I'll greatly appreciate it. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my letter.

                                                                                     Sincerely,

Subject: CHILD SUPPORT WORKERS

Comment: My question is I have a father who has changed jobs 3 times this yr and Im glad he has a job but I think that DSS here in Catawba County isnt fair. There dad filed to modify my case in Nov 20 due to an increase in pay & our daughters braces being paid for. So how does it work when he started his new job 12/1 at MDI.He has yet to tell my regular case worker that he changed job. For the past three times this has happened I have had to tell them he changed jobs. Why is that? What do they do all day they cant do something about this? I have 2 kids by this man & he is now married. I know he doesnt turn in his wifes income which she makes very good $$. I am so upset with the system that when we go to court Thursday 1/15 im asking a judge to look into it. How can you base someones income on a job that they no longer work at? The system is failing us single parents. the last support i received was 12/18 & he has to be behind 1month of payment in order for them to issue a court date. I have missed more work going through this 3times this yr but yet when i talk to both of my case workers I get an attiude. They are suppose to be on our side and yet i feel like they are on his side. What case worker just goes by word and the other case worker dont even know whats goin on. After jan 31 she said they will issue a court date for him for support owed but they did that last time in april of 08 and nothing was done he was behind about 800.00 i didnt see a dime of it. I am just so sick of the system failing us single parents trying to make it. For him to start another job 12/1/08 he should of contacted the regular case worker and payment should of start within a week or so instead of waiting till 1/15 of our court date and the support will go into effect 2/1 like always and not getting a child support check until prob mid Feb Right now the arrears owed to my kids is $1473.04 & come Jan 31 will be up to $2000.00. So, my question to you is how can this be handled? I know there is alot of dead beat dads but why do they let people like my kids father get away with not turning in the correct information after i told them he changed jobs and just waiting till the court date to do something? Sincerely so upset with the system, Crystal Canipe

Subject: Bridge in Catawba County

Comment: First of all, I would like to congratulate you on your wonderful achievement of becoming our governor. I know I spent many hours myself trying to get you elected. My reason for contacting you is to see if you or someone from your staff can check on a bridge in Catawba County that was already suppose to have undergone some repair and has yet to do so. The bridge I am referring to is the bridge that connects Bethlehem and Hickory -- 127 Bridge. I stopped and spoke to a DOT official this morning and he told me that it should have been repaired or possible even replaced this summer but he was unsure why it had not done so. From a boat landing not to far from the bridge, you can see it continuing to separate from the support. I would hope that you or someone can take immediate action so that we will not have a catastrophe like other states have had. Thank you for your time and attention in this matter and again, I would certainly like to say Congratulations. Best Regards, Ricky Bolick

Subject: NCSSM Tuition Grants

Comment: Dear Mrs. Perdue, Congratulations on becoming North Carolina's first female governor. It is a big accomplishment and you should be very happy with yourself. I am, however, very concerned about an issue that is very close to home. I will introduce it as follows: When I was a kid my father made me practice baseball every weekend. Along with soccer and a few other sports that I sampled, I was always very busy. My father pushed me very hard practicing every weekend. It took away what little social life I had and caused me to develop important communication skills much later than many of my friends and colleagues. I became frustrated with my father seemingly trying to dominate my childhood and quit baseball right before my sophomore year in high school. My sophomore year of high school I applied and was accepted to NCSSM. I had long period of which I was unsure of whether I wanted to actually go to the prestigious school, but I eventually chose to accept and use the opportunity to expand myself. I found out a little more than a year ago [I am a sophomore in college now] that the only reason my father pushed me so hard is because I was very good and he thought that I might be able to get a scholarship for college because it would be very difficult to afford it. NCSSM offered me a chance to mature my mind in several different fashions. I am more than content with all the friendships I made and all the opportunities that were provided for me. Correspondingly, the tuition grant helped pay for college and made it so that I won't be in much debt when I finish my 4 year degree. When graduating from NCSSM I heard talk of the tuition grant not being given to younger member because of cuts in the states budget. At the time this information didn't phase me at all because I was too excited with preparing and finally going to college. Recently, I have heard that there are serious threats to the tuition grants that will be given to children who attend NCSSM and I felt that I needed to be sure you knew what exactly what kind of difference that those grants make in the lives of some of the brightest children in North Carolina who feel the need for a broader curriculum for their intellectual appetites. Furthermore, many of the graduates of NCSSM do end up attending North Carolina Schools and subsequently working in North Carolina. To draw an obvious logical conclusion, this is an indirect blow to bright children of middle income families who could use that money to pay for college. I am a concerned NCSSM graduate. I am a mathematics and communication studies major. I have done reports before and contacted important individuals who have shirked my answer because they thought I was doing some article for some journalism class in the journalism school [ie bad press]. I am copying this email and letting the chancellor know that I sent it because I am in collaboration with no one and have yet to share the nature of my thoughts and feelings of this issue with anyone other than my mom and dad. Thank you for your time in reading this e-mail. I hope you help lead North Carolina in a positive direction during your coming administration. Sincerely, Brian Nobles

Comment: Governor Perdue, If someone has years of experience mingled with education experience as well as teaching adults, how can they parlay that into a new career in education administration given the rules for administrators having to serve three years in the classroom. Some people cannot afford that, but are keenly interested in becoming a principal or some other administrator in the school system.

Mrs. Perdue:



I have never written to complain to my governor, congressman or anyone else, but the state of the NCESC is absolutely pitiful.  I am forwarding a copy of an email I sent to the ESC along with my congressman Virginia Foxx.  I don't know if this email will reach you or if anyone cares but at least I've done my part to report it.



Thank you.

Jeannie West  Hunt



HIGH POINT, NC ESC OFFICE



Mr Clegg,



I have never written to complain before, but this location is seriously a flaw in your system.



My husband is on unemployment and normally files by internet.  We have called, called and called again to get an answer to a simple question.  Each time he does get through, he can never speak to anyone - can only leave a message for a call back.



No one has ever returned a phone call.



I finally got through for him today and the lady (I didn't get her name) was trying evidently to answer another call.  I told her I had a very simple question, if she could just transfer me to someone else.  She only said I'll have to put you on hold - I told her we had been put on hold, just transfer me to anyone but she would not.  She put me on hold for 10 minutes before I hung up.



I called back and stopped counting when it rang over 36 times.  When someone did answer, he put me on hold for another 3 minutes before coming to the phone.



I know that unemployment is out the roof right now - I myself have only found a job in the last 2 months after being unemployed after a year, but their total lack of respect and professionalism is unreal.



Now - after finally speaking with someone we find out that he won't even receive his benefits this week.  He was never informed of having to file like he did originally to get the 13 weeks, that he is now in a 'waiting week' and won't receive a check until next week.  WHERE IS THE COMMUNICATION?  WHY WASN'T HE INFORMED OF THIS?  I don't know if you've ever been unemployed, but it is pretty scary to think that you know what day your check is coming; hold off on gas & groceries waiting for that check, and then find out it's not coming.  HAD WE BEEN NOTIFIED WE COULD HAVE PLANNED.  No wonder the ESC has such a poor reputation.



I'm sending this message on to my congressman and the governor.  It may not do ANY good, but at least someone will hear it.  If you have any comments regarding this email I'd love to hear them.  My contact information is listed below.

May you govern with foresight and benevolence! My wife, Juliette, our Eight Year old twins, Olivia & Logan and I recently moved to your beautiful state from the Olympic Village of Lake Placid, New York. We are writing today to give you our impressions of the school system in Western North Carolina and how it compares to school systems we left in New York. There is absolutely no comparison! Your school system, specifically Fairview Elementary School is terrific! From our first visit with Sheila Gibbs, then Fairview Elementary School Principal, to this moment, EVERY element is completely professional, friendly, compassionate. Most importantly, always with thoughts towards the best interest of the child and his/her education, first and foremost. Our daughter, Olivia drew for her first North Carolina Educational experience, Mr. Baxter, the Buncombe County teacher of the year, who she just raves about! Our son, Logan, who suffers Autism from Mercury poisoning, from the immunization shots, is assigned to Mrs. Beth Fields, who was also selected a Special Ed. Teacher of the year! The improvement in my son was visible in FIRST WEEK of school! My wife and I credit North Carolina policies toward education, The Buncombe County School Board, The New Principal, Chad Upton, who had the knowledge to "stay the course, understanding Mrs. Gibbs' path/direction" and last, but certainly not least, Olivia & Logan’s teachers and her/his team of assistants whose caring, compassion and professionalism shows through in my son's and daughter’s face everyday when we pick them up at Fairview Elementary! Governor Perdue, if it were in our power, we would award them all Gold Medals, for their performance, which is certainly Olympic Class! In fact, I could arrange Lake Placid Medals delivered to Fairview Elementary and invite you, Governor, as your first Western North Carolina act as Governor ( I presume), to recognize these outstanding educators by awarding the Lake Placid Medals! I'd love to hear your reaction! If you're not interested or are too busy, perhaps an "attaboy and attagirl" letter to the school/educators,. I'm sure you can imagine how important and uplifting recognition would be from the chief of the State would be! I'm politically astute Governor, I'm also new to North Carolina, but it is easy to see that the electorate here in the Western part of North Carolina are waiting to see how much attention they'll receive from their chief. Just a "heads-up". Thanks for listening....by the way, We are fans! Sincerely, David, Juliette, Logan & Olivia Heim New and proud citizens of North Carolina!

Comment: I am a recent retiree from Martin County Schools, as Guidance Counselor. I have returned to work with the school system but am limited on the amount I can work due to a salary cap put on retirees. Teachers can return to work on a full time basis after retirement, however School Counselors can not, and have to stop work before exceeding the salary cap to avoid interfering with their retirement benefits. What action can be taken to allow School Counselors to continue to work full time as teachers can? We are paid under the same salary schedule as teachers however do not share the same benefits of being able to work full time after retirement. Thank you very much. Murray Elliott 252/809-2275

Subject: EUC08 Benefits

Comment: Good morning Governor Perdue: I have been emailing the Employment Security Commission regarding my extended benefits and I cannot get an answer. I spoke with Mr. David Clegg last week and he has never called me back. I received a letter from the ESC stating that I qualified for extended benefits. When I try to file, I am rejected. Here is my initial email of 12/30/08: Good morning Mr. Clegg: I spoke with you yesterday regarding my appeal for emergency unemployment compensation. When I filed for the first round of emergency unemployment compensation (EUC08), I qualified for these benefits (for 7 weeks) and was paid for three (3) weeks. After that three (3) weeks, I was advised that my benefit year ended and I was to start a new claim. I did so. I was then paid for 13 weeks of benefits. I was advised by your office in Raleigh that I could go back and file for the remainder of my EUC08 benefits once my benefit year ran out. When I attempted to file for the remainder of EUC08 benefits, I was advised that my benefits had been exhausted and I did not qualify for emergency benefits at all! I had only worked for 17 weeks not 20 weeks between April, 2007 to August, 2007. How can I qualify the first time, and then not qualify if the circumstances have not changed? So, for three weeks that are out of my control I do not qualify! I DID NOT and HAVE NOT quit a job! I was laid off from the position in July, 2007 due to the store closing and I DID NOT leave any position due to quitting a job. I had that employer fax a letter to Raleigh stating that they closed the store and the reason I was out of work was out of my control. I have been diligently seeking solid employment through your website and temp agencies, ncpiedmont .com and many other websites and agencies. Please take a moment and investigate how many times I submit for positions on the ESC site alone. I can only submit for three (3) jobs a day on the ESC site. I have contacted Howard Coble's office and the NC Governor's office for investigation on this issue as I have individuals living within a 2 mile radius of me that have been released from prison after 5 months and have filed and received and are receiving emergency unemployment compensation! When I contact Raleigh, I have been advised that this program is federal and the guidelines are federal. When, I contact Howard Coble's office in Washington, DC, (#202-226-9928), they advise me that this program is state controlled! Therefore, I do not know where to begin an appeal. These individuals don't even look for a job, and do not have any documentation to support that they are actively seeking employment. I WILL submit any documentation required to support the fact that I am actively seeking employment EVERY day , ALL day! I have maintained a part time job at $2.13/hour throughout this time. Unfortunately, I am only allowed to work 2 days a week and I was just advised on Friday, December, 26, that the restaurant I am working for is closing. Again, this is out of my control! I respectfully request that my claim for emergency unemployment benefits be approved and reinstated. I will submit all attempts to find employment to your office. Thank you for your time. Ellen Louise Woods Last four of social security number is 9150 I have emailed on Jan5, Jan8, and Jan12. I have heard nothing. I would appreciate any assistance your office can offer. Thank you Ellen L. Woods

Dear Governor Perdue,

The Tories at the State Bureau of Investigation are not responding to criminal complaint charges against corrupt judges and corrupt Wake County District Attorney politicians who peddle judicial influence on behalf of political clients (George W Bush and serial killer FBI Nation) and "billionaires in assets" clientsâ€”TD Ameritrade.  I thought you made it perfectly clear that the King George Washington era has come to an end in this state. Why haven't the felons at the SBI gotten the message?  They have a wanted poster with a 30.00 dollar reward on it online for a serial killer negro with a military haircut who killed 5 people: "CIA murder bragging Rights."

Dear Governor Bev Perdue:

from this final autopsy report conclusion, you can see that "FBI serial killer nation" put undue criminal pressure on Chief Medical Examiner John Butts to fix the time of death at a Tarot Card number of 2:00 a.m. in the morning.   Who is your new choice for Chief Medical Examiner for the state of North Carolina?  A unnecessary delay in withholding the release of an autopsy report means that the murder investigation is tainted by political and criminal corruption: Nancy Cooper of Cary, NC, and Matthew Silliman of Apex, NC.

Subject: Unemployment Benefits

Comment: I have 2 son in laws that have lost their jobs. They filed for unemployment they both were told repeatedly the payments had been mailed, or direct deposited. They were lied to for at least 2 weeks. Finally they were told if they wanted to receive the payment they needed to pay $15.00 to have the payments sent on a debit card by UPS on a certain date. It took both of them 1 1/2 to 2 months to receive a first payment. In the meantime they went without pay. Their wives struggled to pay the bills alone. What is going on with the unemployment benefits in NC. It is your job to fix this!

Subject: Hiring Freeze

Comment: Hello, I am a NC DOC employee. I am currently working at Tabor Correctional in Tabor City, NC. I would like for you to be aware of the danger we correction officers face during a hiring freeze. The facility I work at is supposed to be stafed by 500 plus with an inmate population of 1500. On a good day working on the blue unit (the facility as a whole is split into four housing units) where I work daily. We are lucky if we have 9 Correction Officers. On the blue Unit we supervise over four houndred medium custody inmates. Thats almost a 1 to 45 ratio, and does not meet the NC DOC or State Policy regulations. I understand the budget crisis, but unlike other NC State Jobs like DOT or DMV. Our positions when not properly staffed present real problems that can occur such as assults and riots. Since the hiring freeze has taking affect many Correctional Officers have quite or been unavoidbly fired. The Correctional Officer field of employment should always have a continuous hiring process. Please look into this matter and become abreast on the danger of understaffed prisons not just the one I am employed with, but the others in NC as well that are feeling the effect of being understaffed. Sincerely, Samantha Shaw

Subject: Outdoor Shooting Range

Comment: Governor Perdue, I am sending this message in an effort to alert you as rapidly as possible. An incredibly irresponsible and unjust action is being perpetrated by the North Carolina Department of Justice upon the citizens of Henderson County, and we need your help to stop it. The North Carolina Justice Academy has announced they will move forward with plans to build an outdoor shooting range at their western campus in Edneyville (Henderson County, NC). You must understand that the Western Justice Academy is located within the former Edneyville High School, directly in the heart of our community. When the property was originally secured, future plans called for additional, appropriately-located property to be purchased at a later date for the purpose of constructing a shooting range. Now that plan has been scrapped, and the Department of Justice has decided instead to build a large, fully functional, day/night, indoor/outdoor, tactical rifle and pistol range - right there in the middle of our town. Every single day, guns will be pointed at St. Paul’s Road, a busy stretch of country road that regularly carries school buses, farm tractors, commuters and bicyclists. No protective measure can guarantee the safety of Edneyville residents, and no form of protective barrier can protect against the extreme hazards of high power rifles and pistols being employed in tactical scenarios and from moving vehicles. Citizens and passers by will be at risk day and night. Property values will plummet. Edneyville citizens have been honest and vocal about our very grave concerns and opposition. The Henderson County Board of Commissioners made their opposition to this outdoor shooting range very clear. There is simply no way a plan such as this would ever be approved for a private citizen or business, but the county apparently has no power to stop the Department of Justice. The Attorney General and Justice Academy officials have ignored pleas from the community. Construction will begin soon, but there is still time. Please help to stop this. Ours is a quiet, peaceful community, and we have been gracious hosts of the Justice Academy, but the proposed outdoor shooting range is absolutely unacceptable. Please do whatever you can to help stop this range. Thank you very much for your time. Sincerely, Fred Lyda LCDR Fred R.

Subject: R.H.Donnelley refuses to pay severance



We are writing to tell you about our daughter, Ashley, and my husbands former employers refusal to pay his severance.

Ashley suffers from an eosinophilic disease, which manifests itself by making her body allergic to everything she eats. She was put on a special amino-acid based formula, which she is fed through a feeding tube in her stomach.

At the time our insurance (BC/BS) and my husbands employer (R.H.Donnelley/Dex Yellow Pages) refused to pay for this life

saving formula. This cost of this formula is equal to 20% of our yearly

income. We filed a lawsuit last May to try and get the formula covered. We are only suing for coverage, not for monies. We are in the final stages of this lawsuit.

This past December my husband, along with about 50 other people in

five states were laid-off. We understand that this is a sign of the

economic down turn of our country. We do not dispute the lay-off. Our problem is that my husband was told he would receive a severance due to the eleven years he spent as an employee. This past week many of my husband’s former co-workers have received their severances.

We received a letter, overnighted to us, that we would not receive a severance unless we drop the lawsuit concerning our daughter. We told R.H. Donnelley that we will give up all rights to any lawsuit for now and in the future, except the one we are currently involved in, concerning our daughter My husbands severance is due to his years of being a loyal employee, it is not tied into our lawsuit for the coverage of our daughters’ formula. We feel that we are being bullied and bribed into dropping the lawsuit. We feel this is not legal and we know it is not moral.

If we decide to pursue this in court it could take years. We do not have the resources or the time. We need this severance in order to meet our financial obligations. We have four children and two with health issues that require attention.

It was not an easy decision last year to file a lawsuit for coverage of our daughter’s amino-acid based formula. We did it because we felt they were not following their own policy. We did it for the other families that require this special formula and are also being denied coverage.

We met with a member of the Utah House of Representatives this past week, who will be filing a Bill this year to try and mandate insurance companies to pay for this last option treatment for children like our daughter. We hope that this will pass and no longer be a burden to families. We are just a normal family trying to make ends meet and keep our children alive and healthy. We feel like we are in some nightmare and we don't see a way out. We hope you will take an interest in our story to help others who may be in a situation like ours.  The company  is only giving us until January 22 2009 to sign the papers.

Thank you for your attention and time.

Comment: Dear Mrs. Perdue - I want you to know that I did vote for you. I also wanted to congratulate you on your winning the position of Governor. But, I do have a remark or two that I wanted to take-up with you. One is my concern for the North Carolina roads !?!? We live in New Bern and most of our roads here are in very poor shape !!! So are quite a few in other parts of our state too !!! My other problem is about healthcare !!! I was receiving Medicaid from the state while I was living with someone for quite a few years, and then, we decided to get married - and my Medicaid was cut-out !!! My husband receives SSD (once a month), and Workman's Compensation (weekly), I do work (but, that's to be explained in further detail - later). So, needless to say - I can not afford insurance for myself nor for my youngest child - who is 10 years old now !! So, what are we supposed to do ?? Tell me that that seems fair anyway - that at one time I could receive Medicaid when I am just living with someone, but then, when I get married - I'm punished !?!? Doesn't make since to me at all !!!! I'd appreciate it if you could get to my e-mail as soon as possible - and if I could ever help you in any way - please DON'T hesitate to let me know !!!!! Thank you very, very, much !!! Once again - congratulations and I wish you all the luck and May GOD Bless you and your family and your staff !!!! Sincerely, Andrea D. Watson

Subject: school calendar

Comment: I am very happy that Gov Perdue is now governor of our great state. I have been vocal in NCAE about our school calendar, but when my husband, a banker by trade, brought it up this morning, I knew that we educators were not the only ones who realize how ridiculous this is. Two of our 4 children are in high school taking exams today. They were out for two weeks for Christmas, came back for 6 days, and then have to take EOC's. My husband asked, "Doesn't the Christmas break interfere with test scores since they have such a long break?" On a professional as well as personal (as a parent) level I'd really like to see the calendar decisions left to local school boards. The legislature in making our calendar rules is putting "good business" before appropriate education. Yet if their defense is that it improves the tourism industry, I spend as much on a vacation in late May as I would mid-August. This makes no sense. Please revisit this issue. If you need students to speak on it, I can provide those. Obviously they aren't listening to teachers who are educational professionals.

Subject: cyber school for my middle schooler

Comment: Congratulations! I wish you nothing but success. I homeschool my 12 year old due to health issues. On a trip to Pa to visit relatives I found out about cyber schools. My cousin teaches her son using cyber school. Upon investigation I found there is no cyber school in NC for middle school children. I wondered in this leave no child behind day how PA and SC and other states can offer this and NC does not? Why is this? How can I help to change this? All children deserve this opportunity. Thank you so much for your time at what has to be one of the busiest times of your life. Again, thanks. Sincerely, Jodi Baxter

Subject: Education

Comment: Hi Governor Perdue and staff: Hello again! As a passionate educator in North Carolina, I have concerns about the lack of environmental education in our current K-12 curriculum. I feel strongly that we need a strand of the curriculum that speaks to our committment to environmental awareness and stewardship. Our young people can help redefine green citizenship and even hold the adults in their lives more accountable. If we are going to add "green collar jobs" in any significant amount, the people of North Carolina will need to buy-in to the critical understanding of such a life style change. Please contact me for more information on my ideas for this curriculum. I believe that we must start with the young people. Suburbia is at least aware of stewardship but much of rural North Carolina is left in the dark about why changing our behavior is best for North Carolina and our economy. Thank you, Heather Soja

Hi,



To Whom it may Concern,



As everyone can read below this has been an on going saga with My mom Alma Totten currently a patient at Moses Cone Hospital in room 2111.



We have been fighting to keep from having my mom discharged from the hospital because she wasn't medically ready. We lost our appeals to medicare and she was finally discharged on Friday January 9, 2009 to Heartland Nursing in Greensboro NC. When she arrived to nursing her Physician Dr Miller examined and came to the conclusion that she was to sick to be at a nursing home. He said that he will she how she does through the weekend and make a decision on Monday January 12 if she would be able to stay or go back to the hospital. Our family stayed with her most of the night on Friday  to make sure she was ok. On Saturday around 2:00pm she became very congested and had to be suctioned out several times. Come to find out that the Dr and Social Worker at Moses Cone didn't list all of the medicines that she was on at Mose Cone. She was to receive a breathing treatment every 4 hrs and had gotten since she arrived there on Friday at 1:30pm. She continued this all day Saturday and into Sunday. I left my mom at 7:45am on Sunday January 11Th and she was sleeping fine. My other brother got to the nursing around 10:00am and she was still sleep. Around 10:45am my brother called me and said Mom's heart stopped. The nurses at the nursing home performed CPR until the EMTs got there. The EMTs tried to establish an air way for my mom but her trach tube was obstructed and they couldn't. So They continued CPR. My mom arrived at Moses Cone Hospital about 10 minutes later. They were able to get her heart pumping again but she was with Oxygen for 10 - 20 minutes. Dr Feinstein came into the waiting room and let the family Know that our mom's Trach tube was defective and was working properly. A mucus plug was dislodged inside of it and cut off her airway which caused her heart to stop. We gave him permission to take the Trach Tube since it wasn't working. He said the tube should have been changed and we let him know that we asked the Dr several times before she was discharged to change it but THE ENT Dr Mr Jacobs said it was fine. Several Nurses and Respiratory Therapist asked for it to be changed but they were denied by the Dr. Now my mom is in ICU fighting for her life and could possible have some brain damage. We're meeting with the Neurologist to see this morning at 9:00am to see where we stand. All of this could have been avoided if they Dr's and Medicare would have listen to the family. Also Kindred Hospital the place that Trach in need to be held accountable for using defective and outdated equipment. Moses Cone and Kindred are both guilty of negligence and something needs to be done. I ask you to look into this and do a full investigation this matter.



If any one has any questions please let me know



Thanks

Merdis Totten

My mom was recently transferred to Mose Cone on Dec 16th to due to her x rays coming back with spots on her lungs + there was a signifcant amount of granulated tissue on around her trach.

>  

> Moses Cone examined my mother and found problems with her lungs nor did they find granulated tissue. Over the past week my mom has grown very ill. Her status changed quickly especially her breathing. I spoke with one of her many Drs on the INCOMPASS TEAM and she said she didn't see anything wrong with my mother other she was just getting old. I asked her to look closely at how many time the RT team had to come in and suction my mom. It went from 4 suctions a days to 6 or 10 perday. The Dr still didn't see anything wrong and was still planing to discharge my mother with her breathing issues. The Dr ran more test and they came back negetaive for congestion in her lungs. I spoke with her about maybe my mom has an infection. She said as lone as she was on the trach she would have them.

> My point is that Dr's need to listen to the paitents and families a little more + before Medicare decides to discharge some one they should could out and physical examine the paitent instead of gooing of the Dr's word, becaue they can be wrong to. My is still not ready to be discharged but I;m for sure Medicare will deny our claim with come out to see her and all of the aliments she has.

Subject: NC Public Schools

Comment: I hear from my daughter-in-law, a kindergarten teacher at Snow Hill Primary School, that they no longer have funds to provide basic supplies for the children. She will need to purchase supplies herself if her kindergarteners need pencils, paper, crayons, etc. These children are our future, and this negligence is intolerable. Where is the lottery money and tax revenue that should be earmarked first and foremost for the education of NC's children? Teachers' salaries and educational supplies should be a priority. I hope you are willing to listen and help preserve our future. Thank you. Jackie Mclawhorn

I am writing in an effort to find out when the hiring freeze for Marine Fisheries will be lifted. I am trying to get a job within the Marine Patrol but can not do so because of this freeze. Marine Fisheries tells me that they were told it would be lifted last November, then Janurary and now they are unsure. Just trying to find out something and maybe see if somehow, someway it can be lifted so I can finally get a job in these trying times. Thank you so much for your time and I appreciate all that you, our state government, does for this great place we call North Carolina.

Sincerely,
Rob Anders

Comment: I have been working on getting a youth / teen center up and running. I have local support from local law enforcement as well as the county juvenile justice department. I had tried in the past to get some assistance from the Governors office and hopefully I will have success with you. We do need assistance to get up and running but will be able to help several hundred children when we are established. Please contact me to let me know if there is any assistance we can get. This will be an after school and summmer time recreation center that will be mentoring at risk youths that are already in the juvenile justice department in cleveland county and low income families. Thank you for your time.
