Just make sure you do not then send "Welcome Home" letters to them in 30 days! This will only show how uncaring and unobservant you truly are as it did when you welcome homed our 30th HBCT soldiers on May 15th and they left on April 15th.

Maybe if you would get you head out of your _ _ _ you could function.

Dear Friends,

On this Memorial Day, please join me in remembering all those who have died for our country, so that we may be free.

In North Carolina, we understand military service and sacrifice.  Thousands of veterans, active duty, and reserves live in this state.  They are our families, our friends, and our neighbors.  We thank them for this service and we thank their families.

I'll be at the National Cemetery in New Bern for a Memorial Day Service, I ask you to take time today to reflect on these patriots who have died for America.

Happy Memorial Day and God Bless America!

 Gov. Perdue Blocks Proposal to Hike Income Tax on Working Families
 
On Thursday, Gov. Perdue announced her opposition to a proposed budget deal between the House and Senate.  
"I will not support a budget that is balanced on the backs of working families and that does not protect our public schools," said Gov. Perdue. 
The legislative budget proposal included an income tax surcharge on all taxpayers and did not do what is necessary to protect public education.  Gov. Perdue called on the House and Senate to work together quickly to pass a budget that protects public education and core services without being balanced on the backs of working families. 
 Governor Signs Executive Order to Restrict Spending, Ensure Balanced Budget
 
Gov. Bev Perdue today signed 
Executive Order 20 <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=536> , restricting state spending to ensure a balanced budget while legislators work to finalize a budget for the 2009-10 fiscal year. 
"Until a budget is signed, this order will ensure that North Carolina maintains a balanced budget and that state agencies continue to follow the strict spending guidelines in place during the previous fiscal year," Gov. Perdue said. 
The executive order directs the Office of State Budget and Management (OSBM) to prioritize spending on mandatory obligations and to restrict state agency spending on travel and purchase orders for goods and services. It also restricts agency spending to fill vacant positions. 
To protect the state's core responsibilities in education and public safety, the order allows OSBM to make exceptions for direct expenses for classroom instruction and emergency situations related to law enforcement, health care and public safety. 
The order rescinds the governor's previous executive order to restrict spending for the 2008-09 fiscal year. 
 Continental Teves to Add 338 Jobs in Fletcher
 
Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday announced brake systems and components manufacturer Continental Teves will expand its operations in Henderson County.  The company, a wholly owned subsidiary of global automotive supplier Continental, plans to invest $30.1 million and create 338 jobs in Fletcher during the next five years. 
  "North Carolina ranks 10th nationally in automotive-related jobs thanks to the commitment of such international leaders as Continental and its subsidiary in our state," Gov. Perdue said. "Established companies continue to grow here because they know the value of our top business climate and skilled workforce." 
Continental has its North American headquarters in Michigan and operates two facilities in North Carolina. The Fletcher manufacturing plant currently employs 288 workers, while a plant in Morganton has 367 employees. The overall average wage for the 338 new jobs in Fletcher is expected to be $36,179, not counting benefits, which is higher than the Henderson County average of $31,252. 
North Carolina continues to have a top-ranked business climate.  Through Gov. Perdue's JobsNOW initiative, the state will work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain our workforce and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future. 
For more information about Continental Teves or Continental, visit  <http://www.conti-online.com> www.conti-online.com.  For information about employment opportunities at the Fletcher manufacturing plant, call the Henderson County office of the N.C. Employment Security Commission at (828) 693-1703. 
 Gov. Perdue Announces Second Round of Drinking Water and Wastewater Recovery Projects
 
Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday announced a total of $45.2 million in drinking water, stormwater and wastewater projects in a second round of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) awards.  In total, 40 communities in 31 counties received second-round funding.  More than half of the second-round projects were identified as "green" projects. 
  "These JobsNOW Recovery projects will create jobs, boost the economy, improve the state's infrastructure and protect North Carolina's drinking water and other water systems in the future," said Perdue. 
Nearly $23.9 million in recovery funds will be distributed by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to 28 communities for public water supply projects.  New Hanover County, Jacksonville and Cary were each awarded $3 million, the maximum amount allowed by the ARRA program.  The full list of second-round drinking water award recipients is now available at:  <http://www.deh.enr.state.nc.us/pws/recovery.htm> www.deh.enr.state.nc.us/pws/recovery.htm.  In April, $40.3 million in drinking water funds were awarded to 35 local systems in the initial round of projects. 
In addition, awards totaling $21.3 million will go to 12 communities for wastewater and stormwater projects.  Southport, Burgaw, Brunswick County and Buncombe County received the $3 million maximum allowed under ARRA.  The full list of second-round stormwater and wastewater award recipients is available at:  <http://www.nccgl.net/Stimulus.html> www.nccgl.net/Stimulus.html.  In April, $45.8 million were awarded to 36 communities for stormwater and wastewater projects.

Bev,

I'm so sorry I voted for you!  You seem to be a self serving, power mongering, self serving, insincere politico.
I've been a loyal North Carolina Democrat as long as I have known what politics were all about .You, the late Jimmy Green;
and Mike Easley all all make me sick.  You took less time than they did to achieve this distinction.

Please don't send me anymore of your propaganda.

Paula Jackson McSwain

Gov. Perdue Blocks Proposal to Hike Income Tax on Working Families

On Thursday, Gov. Perdue announced her opposition to a proposed budget deal between the House and Senate. 

"I will not support a budget that is balanced on the backs of working families and that does not protect our public schools," said Gov. Perdue.

The legislative budget proposal included an income tax surcharge on all taxpayers and did not do what is necessary to protect public education.  Gov. Perdue called on the House and Senate to work together quickly to pass a budget that protects public education and core services without being balanced on the backs of working families.

Governor Signs Executive Order to Restrict Spending, Ensure Balanced Budget

Gov. Bev Perdue today signed <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=536>Executive Order 20, restricting state spending to ensure a balanced budget while legislators work to finalize a budget for the 2009-10 fiscal year.

“Until a budget is signed, this order will ensure that North Carolina maintains a balanced budget and that state agencies continue to follow the strict spending guidelines in place during the previous fiscal year,” Gov. Perdue said.

The executive order directs the Office of State Budget and Management (OSBM) to prioritize spending on mandatory obligations and to restrict state agency spending on travel and purchase orders for goods and services. It also restricts agency spending to fill vacant positions.

To protect the state’s core responsibilities in education and public safety, the order allows OSBM to make exceptions for direct expenses for classroom instruction and emergency situations related to law enforcement, health care and public safety.

The order rescinds the governor’s previous executive order to restrict spending for the 2008-09 fiscal year.

Continental Teves to Add 338 Jobs in Fletcher

Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday announced brake systems and components manufacturer Continental Teves will expand its operations in Henderson County.  The company, a wholly owned subsidiary of global automotive supplier Continental, plans to invest $30.1 million and create 338 jobs in Fletcher during the next five years.

“North Carolina ranks 10th nationally in automotive-related jobs thanks to the commitment of such international leaders as Continental and its subsidiary in our state,” Gov. Perdue said. “Established companies continue to grow here because they know the value of our top business climate and skilled workforce.”

Continental has its North American headquarters in Michigan and operates two facilities in North Carolina. The Fletcher manufacturing plant currently employs 288 workers, while a plant in Morganton has 367 employees. The overall average wage for the 338 new jobs in Fletcher is expected to be $36,179, not counting benefits, which is higher than the Henderson County average of $31,252.

North Carolina continues to have a top-ranked business climate.  Through Gov. Perdue’s JobsNOW initiative, the state will work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain our workforce and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

For more information about Continental Teves or Continental, visit <http://www.conti-online.com>www.conti-online.com.  For information about employment opportunities at the Fletcher manufacturing plant, call the Henderson County office of the N.C. Employment Security Commission at (828) 693-1703.

>> Gov. Perdue Signs Bill to Increase Transparency in State Mental Health Facilities

Gov. Bev Perdue today signed Senate Bill 799 to increase the transparency of state mental health, developmental disability and substance abuse facilities by making more information in death records public. Perdue proposed this legislation in March with Attorney General Roy Cooper. It was sponsored by Sen. Rand (D-Bladen, Cumberland). 

>> “This legislation puts the safety of our patients first by ensuring that important information in death records is available to the public,” said Perdue. “By increasing transparency, we will make state facilities more accountable to the people in their care, restore public confidence and rebuild public trust.”

>> Senate Bill 799 will require the following information regarding deaths in state facilities to be public information:

>> - The name, sex, age and date of birth of the deceased; 
>> - The name of the facility providing the report; 
>> - The date, time and location of the death; 
>> - A brief description of the circumstances of death, including the manner of death if known; and 
>> - A list of all entities to whom the event was reported.

>> “More disclosure can shine a light on problems and help ensure patients’ safety.  Our investigators and prosecutors will continue to enforce the law against those who abuse patients in state facilities,” said Cooper.

>> “Transforming the state’s facilities into a true system of care is foremost, and part of that transformation means operating in a climate of transparency.” said DHHS Secretary Lanier Cansler. “While we want to make sure we protect the rights of the individuals we serve, we also want to make sure the public has access to information about our facilities and our plans to correct areas of deficiencies.”

>> North Carolina to Receive $8.8 Million to Help Citizens Buy Energy-Efficient Appliances

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that North Carolina is in line to receive $8.8 million in federal funds to help homeowners purchase energy-efficient appliances, from furnaces and room air conditioners to refrigerators and dishwashers.  The money for ENERGY STAR rated appliances would be distributed through a program to be developed by the Energy Office along with the N.C. Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.

>> The funds are part of nearly $300 million from the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act being distributed nationwide by the U.S. Department of Energy.

>> “Affordable, energy efficient appliances are not only good for the environment, they cut energy costs for consumers and create more business for retailers,” said Perdue. “These recovery funds will help boost our green economy, and make North Carolina a more environmentally friendly state.”

>> The federal Energy Department is recommending that states focus the rebate program efforts on heating and cooling equipment, appliances and water heaters, since these products offer the greatest energy saving potential.

>> In addition, the state and federal government offer tax advantages on the purchase of some major home appliances.  North Carolina also offers a sales tax free holiday weekend on the purchase of some ENERGY STAR products.  This year it is scheduled for Friday, Nov. 6, through Sunday, Nov. 8.

>> Gov. Perdue Calls for Closer Safety Oversight of Coal Ash Ponds

Gov. Perdue this week urged state lawmakers to pass legislation that would increase the safety oversight of coal ash ponds in North Carolina.  The legislation would subject the dams that create coal ash ponds to direct inspection by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources.

>> “Because of where some of the ponds are located, greater safety oversight and more frequent inspections will help reduce potential risks,” said Perdue.

>> A “high hazard” designation was created in the 1980’s for coal ash impoundments and other similar dams that are near densely populated areas or downstream water supplies because of the potential impact of a dam’s failure.  The designation does not reflect the structural condition of the dam.

>> Currently, power companies are only required to file reports every five years by private engineers on the structural conditions of the dams.  The impoundments are exempt from regulation under the N.C. Dam Safety Act.

>> The proposal will be sponsored by Rep. Pricey Harrison of Greensboro and will subject coal ash dams to the Dam Safety Act, which would more closely regulate the impoundments and would require a state inspection every two years.

>> Anson County Manufacturer to Add 65 Jobs

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced that Yale Industrial Products Inc., a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of material-handling products, will expand operations in Wadesboro.  The company plans to invest $3 million and create 65 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $116,300 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

>> “North Carolina remains a strong, diverse industrial manufacturing region,” Perdue said. “Our state is attractive to companies looking for opportunities provided by our skilled workforce, business-friendly climate and tremendous quality of life.”

>> Yale Industrial Products Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbus McKinnon Corp. of New York (NASDAQ: CMCO), which makes powered and manual hoists, trolleys, cranes and other material-handling equipment for diverse applications worldwide. Columbus McKinnon also owns Duff-Norton, a separate manufacturing facility in Charlotte.

>> North Carolina continues to have a top ranked business climate.  Through Gov. Perdue’s JobsNOW initiative, the state will work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain our workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

>> For more information about Yale Industrial Products and Columbus McKinnon, please visit <http://www.cmworks.com>www.cmworks.com.

Thanks for the updates.  Please continue to protect the cuts in the education system.  Our children did NOT get us into this mess, and they shouldn't have to pay for it.....
Our healthcare system, while not perfect, is the BEST in the world.  Please see to it that there are reforms made to it--and do not subject us to the mess that our President is proposing.
There are tons of "pork barrel" that can be cut in order to save millions without having to have additional taxes and cuts into the education and health systems.
Attempting to reduce the influx of illegal immigrants will not only help those two systems, but will also cut the costs of law enforcement and prisons.
Thanks for your help.

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

> In that time, our stateâ€™s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent â€” 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolinaâ€™s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our stateâ€™s budget.

> The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolinaâ€™s history.

> Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolinaâ€™s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

> This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our stateâ€™s mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

> Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

> Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolinaâ€™s long-term economic growth.

> Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

> As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

> We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

> Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolinaâ€™s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

> As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

> Iâ€™ve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our childrenâ€™s education.

> The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.

>  

>           Sincerely,

>

Gov. Perdue's Probabtion Reforms to Improve Public Safety

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced significant reforms to the probation system that will speed the process of obtaining warrants for parole commission violators and put more information into the hands of law enforcement officers on the streets.
These reforms include the following changes:
- The Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission will respond to requests for warrants within 24 hours;
- Probation officers will receive a response to a violation report within that same 24 hours;
- If a warrant is issued it will be entered into the DCI network immediately; and
- Law enforcement officers across North Carolina will have immediate access to information about probationers and prison inmates on their vehicle computers whenever a license check is conducted.
In addition, the governor signed Senate Bill 920, her proposal to:
- Allow probation officers the authority to perform warrantless searches on supervised probationers;
- Give law enforcement officers the ability to perform warrantless searches if they have reasonable suspicion that the probationer is engaged in criminal activity or possesses a weapon without written court permission;
- Allow probation officers limited access to juvenile criminal records, providing them with better insight into the risks offenders pose;
â€œWith these changes, law enforcement and probation officers will have immediate access to probation information and will be better prepared to protect themselves and their communities,â€ Perdue said. â€œThese reforms will strengthen our probation system and make our communities safer.
â€œThis kind of access to information is crucial for the safety of our officers, our law enforcement partners and the public,â€ said Correction Secretary Alvin Keller.  â€œNo longer will probation violators be able to hide from the system.â€
Also, Governor Perdue announced that information from the Department of Correction offender database of more than 1.1 million criminal offenders is being shared with the law enforcement community via the DCI network.
Since the computer system for law enforcement vehicles was activated on June 24, officers have entered roughly 128,000 queries, and 1,146 probation absconders have been arrested.

Gov. Perdue Signs Bill Establishing Stricter Safety Oversight of Coal Ash Ponds

Gov. Perdue today signed Senate Bill 1004, increasing the safety oversight of coal ash ponds in North Carolina. The legislation subjects dams that create coal ash ponds to direct inspection by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources. 
â€œBecause of potential risk posed by the location of North Carolinaâ€™s coal ash ponds, we must provide greater oversight and more frequent inspections,â€ said Gov. Perdue. â€œThis legislation will keep our citizens safer and our dams more secure.â€
In June, the Environmental Protection Agency released a list of 44 â€œhigh-hazardâ€ coal ash waste dams across the county. Twelve of these dams were located in North Carolina, more than any other state. A â€œhigh hazardâ€ designation was created in the 1980â€™s for coal ash impoundments and other similar dams that are near densely populated areas, downstream water supplies, important public utilities or primary highways because of the potential impact of a damâ€™s failure.  The designation does not reflect the structural condition of the dam. 
Currently, power companies are only required to file reports every five years by private engineers on the structural conditions of the dams.  The reports are filed with the N.C. Utilities Commission and the impoundments are exempt from regulation under the N.C. Dam Safety Act.
This legislation, sponsored by Sen. David Hoyle (D-Guilford) and led by Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) in the House, places coal ash dams and ponds under the regulation of the Dam Safety Act. This means the structures will be more closely regulated, and requires a state inspection every two years. 

15 Contracts Totaling More Than $29 Million Awarded for Highway Projects Across NC

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced that 15 contracts totaling $29.3 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including seven projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The contracts were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.
â€œThese projects will stimulate economic growth by creating and maintaining jobs as we enhance safety and keep our people traveling,â€ Perdue said.
According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.
For more information about funding for infrastructure improvements in North Carolina, as well as other NCDOT projects and activities, visit <http://www.ncdot.gov>www.ncdot.gov.

NC Submits Grant Application for Economic Recovery Funding for I-85 Improvement Project

North Carolina has submitted a grant application for $300 million in discretionary grant money included in the ARRA to use for the I-85 Corridor Improvement Project, which includes replacing the I-85 bridge over the Yadkin River, in Davidson and Rowan counties. Comprehensive information about the project is available on a new Web site, <http://www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/>www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/.
â€œReplacing this bridge is critical to preserving safety, travel and commerce along this vital interstate route and is an ideal candidate for recovery funding,â€ Perdue said. â€œThese improvements are essential to ensuring that I-85 continues to move people and goods safely and effectively on a regional, statewide and national level.â€
Perdue has been working with Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and North Carolinaâ€™s congressional delegation to obtain funding for the project. It also has received tremendous support from local communities and business leaders advocating for the project. Nearly 100 letters and resolutions of endorsement have been received to date and can be viewed on the project Web site.
The I-85 Corridor Improvement Project will complete a comprehensive overhaul of the highway, bridge and rail infrastructure located along 6.8 miles of I-85 from north of Long Ferry Road (Exit 81) in Rowan County to U.S. 29-52-70/I-85 Business (Exit 87) in Davidson County. The project would be completed under two design-build contracts, which allow project teams of designers and contractors to conduct design and construction work simultaneously to expedite completion, at an estimated cost of more than $300 million.
I-85 is the most direct and heavily traveled route between Richmond and Atlanta. The stretch of highway included in this project currently carries nearly 70,000 vehicles per day, with traffic counts projected to more than double by 2030. Trucks account for 26 percent of the traffic along this portion of I-85.
Right now, this stretch has only two lanes in each direction, with narrow shoulders, sharp curves and closely spaced interchanges. The existing I-85 Yadkin River Bridge is outdated and narrow and is currently rated in poor condition and classified as both structurally deficient (having elements that need to be monitored and/or repaired) and functionally obsolete (outdated in design).
The total crash rate for this portion of I-85 is about 77 percent higher than the average crash rate for comparable roadways across the state, while the fatal crash rate is 80 percent higher.
The project is expected to reduce crash rates by 75 percent and improve traffic flow by alleviating existing bottlenecks. Improvements to the railroad tracks that cross under I-85 will increase track speed by 45 percent and accommodate future rail needs, including the implementation of high-speed rail.
from an economic standpoint, the project has the potential to create or sustain more than 7,000 jobs, and it is expected to result in economic benefits 12 to 17 times its cost. This stretch of I-85 is in a region of the state that has been hard-hit by job losses, with both Davidson and Rowan counties qualifying as economically distressed areas under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965.

Gov. Perdue Joins Statewide Health Leaders at President's Town Hall

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday joined health leaders from across North Carolina to attend President Barack Obamaâ€™s health care forum at Broughton High School in Raleigh. The governor invited representatives from the stateâ€™s leading health care organizations, including hospitals, research institutions, advocates and minority groups, to attend the event with her.
â€œI applaud the president for prioritizing health care and for working with Congress to bring about change,â€ Perdue said. â€œHere in North Carolina, one in five of our citizens does not have health insurance. We are living the problem, and we are all anxious for a solution.
â€œWhen I spoke to President Obama this morning, I told him I believe strongly that reform must take place at the federal level.  We have innovative solutions to providing care in North Carolina, and we have excellent providers, but our finances are stretched to the limit.  We must ensure that the financial burden of a new system cannot fall to the states.  A national health care system must provide the right care, at the right time, at the right place â€“ but at a price that people, and states, can afford.â€

Currently, power companies are only required to file reports every five years by private engineers on the structural conditions of the dams.  The reports are filed with the N.C. Utilities Commission and the impoundments are exempt from regulation under the N.C. Dam Safety Act.
This legislation, sponsored by Sen. David Hoyle (D-Guilford) and led by Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) in the House, places coal ash dams and ponds under the regulation of the Dam Safety Act. This means the structures will be more closely regulated, and requires a state inspection every two years. 

15 Contracts Totaling More Than $29 Million Awarded for Highway Projects Across NC

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced that 15 contracts totaling $29.3 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including seven projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The contracts were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.
â€œThese projects will stimulate economic growth by creating and maintaining jobs as we enhance safety and keep our people traveling,â€ Perdue said.
According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.

NC Submits Grant Application for Economic Recovery Funding for I-85 Improvement Project

North Carolina has submitted a grant application for $300 million in discretionary grant money included in the ARRA to use for the I-85 Corridor Improvement Project, which includes replacing the I-85 bridge over the Yadkin River, in Davidson and Rowan counties. Comprehensive information about the project is available on a new Web site, <http://www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/>www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/.
â€œReplacing this bridge is critical to preserving safety, travel and commerce along this vital interstate route and is an ideal candidate for recovery funding,â€ Perdue said. â€œThese improvements are essential to ensuring that I-85 continues to move people and goods safely and effectively on a regional, statewide and national level.â€
Perdue has been working with Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and North Carolinaâ€™s congressional delegation to obtain funding for the project. It also has received tremendous support from local communities and business leaders advocating for the project. Nearly 100 letters and resolutions of endorsement have been received to date and can be viewed on the project Web site.
The I-85 Corridor Improvement Project will complete a comprehensive overhaul of the highway, bridge and rail infrastructure located along 6.8 miles of I-85 from north of Long Ferry Road (Exit 81) in Rowan County to U.S. 29-52-70/I-85 Business (Exit 87) in Davidson County. The project would be completed under two design-build contracts, which allow project teams of designers and contractors to conduct design and construction work simultaneously to expedite completion, at an estimated cost of more than $300 million.
I-85 is the most direct and heavily traveled route between Richmond and Atlanta. The stretch of highway included in this project currently carries nearly 70,000 vehicles per day, with traffic counts projected to more than double by 2030. Trucks account for 26 percent of the traffic along this portion of I-85.
Right now, this stretch has only two lanes in each direction, with narrow shoulders, sharp curves and closely spaced interchanges. The existing I-85 Yadkin River Bridge is outdated and narrow and is currently rated in poor condition and classified as both structurally deficient (having elements that need to be monitored and/or repaired) and functionally obsolete (outdated in design).
The total crash rate for this portion of I-85 is about 77 percent higher than the average crash rate for comparable roadways across the state, while the fatal crash rate is 80 percent higher.
The project is expected to reduce crash rates by 75 percent and improve traffic flow by alleviating existing bottlenecks. Improvements to the railroad tracks that cross under I-85 will increase track speed by 45 percent and accommodate future rail needs, including the implementation of high-speed rail.
from an economic standpoint, the project has the potential to create or sustain more than 7,000 jobs, and it is expected to result in economic benefits 12 to 17 times its cost. This stretch of I-85 is in a region of the state that has been hard-hit by job losses, with both Davidson and Rowan counties qualifying as economically distressed areas under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965.

Gov. Perdue Joins Statewide Health Leaders at President's Town Hall

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday joined health leaders from across North Carolina to attend President Barack Obamaâ€™s health care forum at Broughton High School in Raleigh. The governor invited representatives from the stateâ€™s leading health care organizations, including hospitals, research institutions, advocates and minority groups, to attend the event with her.
â€œI applaud the president for prioritizing health care and for working with Congress to bring about change,â€ Perdue said. â€œHere in North Carolina, one in five of our citizens does not have health insurance. We are living the problem, and we are all anxious for a solution.
â€œWhen I spoke to President Obama this morning, I told him I believe strongly that reform must take place at the federal level.  We have innovative solutions to providing care in North Carolina, and we have excellent providers, but our finances are stretched to the limit.  We must ensure that the financial burden of a new system cannot fall to the states.  A national health care system must provide the right care, at the right time, at the right place â€“ but at a price that people, and states, can afford.â€

To Wayne White:  Wayne, I did not get your email and don't want to pester you again on a Friday by phone, but I really appreciated your response and quick efforts.  Unfortunately, Corey Fraley said they save their allocation of tickets for folks in their congressional district and even then, the advance planning imperative is roughly six months notice in advance.  I have no inroads with Congressman Watts, and have had some great legal battles through the years with his former law firm.  I'm the wrong party for Congressman Coble (of course, he probably is the wrong party himself to be pushing for any special tickets).  Again, I appreciated your help and please do relay my "only claim to fame" to Sharon Nelson to feed Governor "Moore", I mean, Perdue!  Best wishes, Glenn.

Gov. Perdue's Probabtion Reforms to Improve Public Safety

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced significant reforms to the probation system that will speed the process of obtaining warrants for parole commission violators and put more information into the hands of law enforcement officers on the streets.

<https://webmail.fusemail.com/sq/src/download.php?absolute_dl=true&passed_id=3094&mailbox=INBOX&ent_id=1.3>These reforms include the following changes:

- The Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission will respond to requests for warrants within 24 hours;

- Probation officers will receive a response to a violation report within that same 24 hours;

- If a warrant is issued it will be entered into the DCI network immediately; and

- Law enforcement officers across North Carolina will have immediate access to information about probationers and prison inmates on their vehicle computers whenever a license check is conducted.

In addition, the governor signed Senate Bill 920, her proposal to:

- Allow probation officers the authority to perform warrantless searches on supervised probationers;

- Give law enforcement officers the ability to perform warrantless searches if they have reasonable suspicion that the probationer is engaged in criminal activity or possesses a weapon without written court permission;

- Allow probation officers limited access to juvenile criminal records, providing them with better insight into the risks offenders pose;

â€œWith these changes, law enforcement and probation officers will have immediate access to probation information and will be better prepared to protect themselves and their communities,â€ Perdue said. â€œThese reforms will strengthen our probation system and make our communities safer.

â€œThis kind of access to information is crucial for the safety of our officers, our law enforcement partners and the public,â€ said Correction Secretary Alvin Keller.  â€œNo longer will probation violators be able to hide from the system.â€

Also, Governor Perdue announced that information from the Department of Correction offender database of more than 1.1 million criminal offenders is being shared with the law enforcement community via the DCI network.

Since the computer system for law enforcement vehicles was activated on June 24, officers have entered roughly 128,000 queries, and 1,146 probation absconders have been arrested.

Gov. Perdue Signs Bill Establishing Stricter Safety Oversight of Coal Ash Ponds

Gov. Perdue today signed Senate Bill 1004, increasing the safety oversight of coal ash ponds in North Carolina. The legislation subjects dams that create coal ash ponds to direct inspection by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources. 

â€œBecause of potential risk posed by the location of North Carolinaâ€™s coal ash ponds, we must provide greater oversight and more frequent inspections,â€ said Gov. Perdue. â€œThis legislation will keep our citizens safer and our dams more secure.â€

In June, the Environmental Protection Agency released a list of 44 â€œhigh-hazardâ€ coal ash waste dams across the county. Twelve of these dams were located in North Carolina, more than any other state. A â€œhigh hazardâ€ designation was created in the 1980â€™s for coal ash impoundments and other similar dams that are near densely populated areas, downstream water supplies, important public utilities or primary highways because of the potential impact of a damâ€™s failure.  The designation does not reflect the structural condition of the dam.

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced significant reforms to the probation system that will speed the process of obtaining warrants for parole commission violators and put more information into the hands of law enforcement officers on the streets.

> These reforms include the following changes:

> - The Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission will respond to requests for warrants within 24 hours;

> - Probation officers will receive a response to a violation report within that same 24 hours;

> - If a warrant is issued it will be entered into the DCI network immediately; and

> - Law enforcement officers across North Carolina will have immediate access to information about probationers and prison inmates on their vehicle computers whenever a license check is conducted.

> In addition, the governor signed Senate Bill 920, her proposal to:

> - Allow probation officers the authority to perform warrantless searches on supervised probationers;

> - Give law enforcement officers the ability to perform warrantless searches if they have reasonable suspicion that the probationer is engaged in criminal activity or possesses a weapon without written court permission;

> - Allow probation officers limited access to juvenile criminal records, providing them with better insight into the risks offenders pose;

> “With these changes, law enforcement and probation officers will have immediate access to probation information and will be better prepared to protect themselves and their communities,” Perdue said. “These reforms will strengthen our probation system and make our communities safer.

> “This kind of access to information is crucial for the safety of our officers, our law enforcement partners and the public,” said Correction Secretary Alvin Keller.  “No longer will probation violators be able to hide from the system.”

> Also, Governor Perdue announced that information from the Department of Correction offender database of more than 1.1 million criminal offenders is being shared with the law enforcement community via the DCI network.

> Since the computer system for law enforcement vehicles was activated on June 24, officers have entered roughly 128,000 queries, and 1,146 probation absconders have been arrested.

> Gov. Perdue Signs Bill Establishing Stricter Safety Oversight of Coal Ash Ponds

Gov. Perdue today signed Senate Bill 1004, increasing the safety oversight of coal ash ponds in North Carolina. The legislation subjects dams that create coal ash ponds to direct inspection by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources. 

> “Because of potential risk posed by the location of North Carolina’s coal ash ponds, we must provide greater oversight and more frequent inspections,” said Gov. Perdue. “This legislation will keep our citizens safer and our dams more secure.”

> In June, the Environmental Protection Agency released a list of 44 “high-hazard” coal ash waste dams across the county. Twelve of these dams were located in North Carolina, more than any other state. A “high hazard” designation was created in the 1980’s for coal ash impoundments and other similar dams that are near densely populated areas, downstream water supplies, important public utilities or primary highways because of the potential impact of a dam’s failure.  The designation does not reflect the structural condition of the dam. 

> Currently, power companies are only required to file reports every five years by private engineers on the structural conditions of the dams.  The reports are filed with the N.C. Utilities Commission and the impoundments are exempt from regulation under the N.C. Dam Safety Act.

> This legislation, sponsored by Sen. David Hoyle (D-Guilford) and led by Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) in the House, places coal ash dams and ponds under the regulation of the Dam Safety Act. This means the structures will be more closely regulated, and requires a state inspection every two years. 

> 15 Contracts Totaling More Than $29 Million Awarded for Highway Projects Across NC

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced that 15 contracts totaling $29.3 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including seven projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The contracts were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.

> “These projects will stimulate economic growth by creating and maintaining jobs as we enhance safety and keep our people traveling,” Perdue said.

> According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.

> For more information about funding for infrastructure improvements in North Carolina, as well as other NCDOT projects and activities, visit <http://www.ncdot.gov>www.ncdot.gov.

> NC Submits Grant Application for Economic Recovery Funding for I-85 Improvement Project

North Carolina has submitted a grant application for $300 million in discretionary grant money included in the ARRA to use for the I-85 Corridor Improvement Project, which includes replacing the I-85 bridge over the Yadkin River, in Davidson and Rowan counties. Comprehensive information about the project is available on a new Web site, <http://www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/>www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/.

> “Replacing this bridge is critical to preserving safety, travel and commerce along this vital interstate route and is an ideal candidate for recovery funding,” Perdue said. “These improvements are essential to ensuring that I-85 continues to move people and goods safely and effectively on a regional, statewide and national level.”

> Perdue has been working with Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and North Carolina’s congressional delegation to obtain funding for the project. It also has received tremendous support from local communities and business leaders advocating for the project. Nearly 100 letters and resolutions of endorsement have been received to date and can be viewed on the project Web site.

> The I-85 Corridor Improvement Project will complete a comprehensive overhaul of the highway, bridge and rail infrastructure located along 6.8 miles of I-85 from north of Long Ferry Road (Exit 81) in Rowan County to U.S. 29-52-70/I-85 Business (Exit 87) in Davidson County. The project would be completed under two design-build contracts, which allow project teams of designers and contractors to conduct design and construction work simultaneously to expedite completion, at an estimated cost of more than $300 million.

> I-85 is the most direct and heavily traveled route between Richmond and Atlanta. The stretch of highway included in this project currently carries nearly 70,000 vehicles per day, with traffic counts projected to more than double by 2030. Trucks account for 26 percent of the traffic along this portion of I-85.

> Right now, this stretch has only two lanes in each direction, with narrow shoulders, sharp curves and closely spaced interchanges. The existing I-85 Yadkin River Bridge is outdated and narrow and is currently rated in poor condition and classified as both structurally deficient (having elements that need to be monitored and/or repaired) and functionally obsolete (outdated in design).

> The total crash rate for this portion of I-85 is about 77 percent higher than the average crash rate for comparable roadways across the state, while the fatal crash rate is 80 percent higher.

> The project is expected to reduce crash rates by 75 percent and improve traffic flow by alleviating existing bottlenecks. Improvements to the railroad tracks that cross under I-85 will increase track speed by 45 percent and accommodate future rail needs, including the implementation of high-speed rail.

> From an economic standpoint, the project has the potential to create or sustain more than 7,000 jobs, and it is expected to result in economic benefits 12 to 17 times its cost. This stretch of I-85 is in a region of the state that has been hard-hit by job losses, with both Davidson and Rowan counties qualifying as economically distressed areas under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965.

> Gov. Perdue Joins Statewide Health Leaders at President's Town Hall

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday joined health leaders from across North Carolina to attend President Barack Obama’s health care forum at Broughton High School in Raleigh. The governor invited representatives from the state’s leading health care organizations, including hospitals, research institutions, advocates and minority groups, to attend the event with her.

> “I applaud the president for prioritizing health care and for working with Congress to bring about change,” Perdue said. “Here in North Carolina, one in five of our citizens does not have health insurance. We are living the problem, and we are all anxious for a solution.

> “When I spoke to President Obama this morning, I told him I believe strongly that reform must take place at the federal level.  We have innovative solutions to providing care in North Carolina, and we have excellent providers, but our finances are stretched to the limit.  We must ensure that the financial burden of a new system cannot fall to the states.  A national health care system must provide the right care, at the right time, at the right place – but at a price that people, and states, can afford.”

Right now, this stretch has only two lanes in each direction, with narrow shoulders, sharp curves and closely spaced interchanges. The existing I-85 Yadkin River Bridge is outdated and narrow and is currently rated in poor condition and classified as both structurally deficient (having elements that need to be monitored and/or repaired) and functionally obsolete (outdated in design).

The total crash rate for this portion of I-85 is about 77 percent higher than the average crash rate for comparable roadways across the state, while the fatal crash rate is 80 percent higher.

The project is expected to reduce crash rates by 75 percent and improve traffic flow by alleviating existing bottlenecks. Improvements to the railroad tracks that cross under I-85 will increase track speed by 45 percent and accommodate future rail needs, including the implementation of high-speed rail.

from an economic standpoint, the project has the potential to create or sustain more than 7,000 jobs, and it is expected to result in economic benefits 12 to 17 times its cost. This stretch of I-85 is in a region of the state that has been hard-hit by job losses, with both Davidson and Rowan counties qualifying as economically distressed areas under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965.

Dear Gevernor,

I'd like to make a suggestion .

Since the large majority of my taxes seem to be going to education for all the families with children, and families moving here from out of state, why not consider an education "surcharge" for those people?

After all, I seem to be paying for their children's education and getting nothing for it ...wouldn't it be reasonable to ask these folks to kick in a little extra for THEIR children's education rather than asking  people that smoke tabacco, people that drink a little alcohol, and people that make a decent living pay it?

Our state is on track to be just like New York in a few years, and I feel that is very, very sad.

Sincerely,
Stephen Scott
Raleigh, NC

> Gov. Perdue's Probabtion Reforms to Improve Public Safety

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced significant reforms to the probation system that will speed the process of obtaining warrants for parole commission violators and put more information into the hands of law enforcement officers on the streets.

> These reforms include the following changes:

> - The Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission will respond to requests for warrants within 24 hours;

> - Probation officers will receive a response to a violation report within that same 24 hours;

> - If a warrant is issued it will be entered into the DCI network immediately; and

> - Law enforcement officers across North Carolina will have immediate access to information about probationers and prison inmates on their vehicle computers whenever a license check is conducted.

> In addition, the governor signed Senate Bill 920, her proposal to:

> - Allow probation officers the authority to perform warrantless searches on supervised probationers;

> - Give law enforcement officers the ability to perform warrantless searches if they have reasonable suspicion that the probationer is engaged in criminal activity or possesses a weapon without written court permission;

> - Allow probation officers limited access to juvenile criminal records, providing them with better insight into the risks offenders pose;

> “With these changes, law enforcement and probation officers will have immediate access to probation information and will be better prepared to protect themselves and their communities,” Perdue said. “These reforms will strengthen our probation system and make our communities safer.

> “This kind of access to information is crucial for the safety of our officers, our law enforcement partners and the public,” said Correction Secretary Alvin Keller.  “No longer will probation violators be able to hide from the system.”

> Also, Governor Perdue announced that information from the Department of Correction offender database of more than 1.1 million criminal offenders is being shared with the law enforcement community via the DCI network.

> Since the computer system for law enforcement vehicles was activated on June 24, officers have entered roughly 128,000 queries, and 1,146 probation absconders have been arrested.

> Gov. Perdue Signs Bill Establishing Stricter Safety Oversight of Coal Ash Ponds

Gov. Perdue today signed Senate Bill 1004, increasing the safety oversight of coal ash ponds in North Carolina. The legislation subjects dams that create coal ash ponds to direct inspection by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources. 

> “Because of potential risk posed by the location of North Carolina’s coal ash ponds, we must provide greater oversight and more frequent inspections,” said Gov. Perdue. “This legislation will keep our citizens safer and our dams more secure.”

> In June, the Environmental Protection Agency released a list of 44 “high-hazard” coal ash waste dams across the county. Twelve of these dams were located in North Carolina, more than any other state. A “high hazard” designation was created in the 1980’s for coal ash impoundments and other similar dams that are near densely populated areas, downstream water supplies, important public utilities or primary highways because of the potential impact of a dam’s failure.  The designation does not reflect the structural condition of the dam. 

> Currently, power companies are only required to file reports every five years by private engineers on the structural conditions of the dams.  The reports are filed with the N.C. Utilities Commission and the impoundments are exempt from regulation under the N.C. Dam Safety Act.

> This legislation, sponsored by Sen. David Hoyle (D-Guilford) and led by Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) in the House, places coal ash dams and ponds under the regulation of the Dam Safety Act. This means the structures will be more closely regulated, and requires a state inspection every two years. 

> 15 Contracts Totaling More Than $29 Million Awarded for Highway Projects Across NC

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced that 15 contracts totaling $29.3 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including seven projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The contracts were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.

> “These projects will stimulate economic growth by creating and maintaining jobs as we enhance safety and keep our people traveling,” Perdue said.

> According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.

> For more information about funding for infrastructure improvements in North Carolina, as well as other NCDOT projects and activities, visit <http://www.ncdot.gov>www.ncdot.gov.

> NC Submits Grant Application for Economic Recovery Funding for I-85 Improvement Project

North Carolina has submitted a grant application for $300 million in discretionary grant money included in the ARRA to use for the I-85 Corridor Improvement Project, which includes replacing the I-85 bridge over the Yadkin River, in Davidson and Rowan counties. Comprehensive information about the project is available on a new Web site, <http://www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/>www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/.

> “Replacing this bridge is critical to preserving safety, travel and commerce along this vital interstate route and is an ideal candidate for recovery funding,” Perdue said. “These improvements are essential to ensuring that I-85 continues to move people and goods safely and effectively on a regional, statewide and national level.”

> Perdue has been working with Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and North Carolina’s congressional delegation to obtain funding for the project. It also has received tremendous support from local communities and business leaders advocating for the project. Nearly 100 letters and resolutions of endorsement have been received to date and can be viewed on the project Web site.

> The I-85 Corridor Improvement Project will complete a comprehensive overhaul of the highway, bridge and rail infrastructure located along 6.8 miles of I-85 from north of Long Ferry Road (Exit 81) in Rowan County to U.S. 29-52-70/I-85 Business (Exit 87) in Davidson County. The project would be completed under two design-build contracts, which allow project teams of designers and contractors to conduct design and construction work simultaneously to expedite completion, at an estimated cost of more than $300 million.

> I-85 is the most direct and heavily traveled route between Richmond and Atlanta. The stretch of highway included in this project currently carries nearly 70,000 vehicles per day, with traffic counts projected to more than double by 2030. Trucks account for 26 percent of the traffic along this portion of I-85.

> Right now, this stretch has only two lanes in each direction, with narrow shoulders, sharp curves and closely spaced interchanges.

Also, Governor Perdue announced that information from the Department of Correction offender database of more than 1.1 million criminal offenders is being shared with the law enforcement community via the DCI network.

Since the computer system for law enforcement vehicles was activated on June 24, officers have entered roughly 128,000 queries, and 1,146 probation absconders have been arrested.

Gov. Perdue Signs Bill Establishing Stricter Safety Oversight of Coal Ash Ponds

Gov. Perdue today signed Senate Bill 1004, increasing the safety oversight of coal ash ponds in North Carolina. The legislation subjects dams that create coal ash ponds to direct inspection by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources. 

“Because of potential risk posed by the location of North Carolina’s coal ash ponds, we must provide greater oversight and more frequent inspections,” said Gov. Perdue. “This legislation will keep our citizens safer and our dams more secure.”

In June, the Environmental Protection Agency released a list of 44 “high-hazard” coal ash waste dams across the county. Twelve of these dams were located in North Carolina, more than any other state. A “high hazard” designation was created in the 1980’s for coal ash impoundments and other similar dams that are near densely populated areas, downstream water supplies, important public utilities or primary highways because of the potential impact of a dam’s failure.  The designation does not reflect the structural condition of the dam. 

Currently, power companies are only required to file reports every five years by private engineers on the structural conditions of the dams.  The reports are filed with the N.C. Utilities Commission and the impoundments are exempt from regulation under the N.C. Dam Safety Act.

This legislation, sponsored by Sen. David Hoyle (D-Guilford) and led by Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) in the House, places coal ash dams and ponds under the regulation of the Dam Safety Act. This means the structures will be more closely regulated, and requires a state inspection every two years. 

15 Contracts Totaling More Than $29 Million Awarded for Highway Projects Across NC

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced that 15 contracts totaling $29.3 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including seven projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The contracts were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.

“These projects will stimulate economic growth by creating and maintaining jobs as we enhance safety and keep our people traveling,” Perdue said.

According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.

NC Submits Grant Application for Economic Recovery Funding for I-85 Improvement Project

North Carolina has submitted a grant application for $300 million in discretionary grant money included in the ARRA to use for the I-85 Corridor Improvement Project, which includes replacing the I-85 bridge over the Yadkin River, in Davidson and Rowan counties. Comprehensive information about the project is available on a new Web site, <http://www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/>www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/.

“Replacing this bridge is critical to preserving safety, travel and commerce along this vital interstate route and is an ideal candidate for recovery funding,” Perdue said. “These improvements are essential to ensuring that I-85 continues to move people and goods safely and effectively on a regional, statewide and national level.”

Perdue has been working with Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and North Carolina’s congressional delegation to obtain funding for the project. It also has received tremendous support from local communities and business leaders advocating for the project. Nearly 100 letters and resolutions of endorsement have been received to date and can be viewed on the project Web site.

The I-85 Corridor Improvement Project will complete a comprehensive overhaul of the highway, bridge and rail infrastructure located along 6.8 miles of I-85 from north of Long Ferry Road (Exit 81) in Rowan County to U.S. 29-52-70/I-85 Business (Exit 87) in Davidson County. The project would be completed under two design-build contracts, which allow project teams of designers and contractors to conduct design and construction work simultaneously to expedite completion, at an estimated cost of more than $300 million.

I-85 is the most direct and heavily traveled route between Richmond and Atlanta. The stretch of highway included in this project currently carries nearly 70,000 vehicles per day, with traffic counts projected to more than double by 2030. Trucks account for 26 percent of the traffic along this portion of I-85.

Right now, this stretch has only two lanes in each direction, with narrow shoulders, sharp curves and closely spaced interchanges. The existing I-85 Yadkin River Bridge is outdated and narrow and is currently rated in poor condition and classified as both structurally deficient (having elements that need to be monitored and/or repaired) and functionally obsolete (outdated in design).

The total crash rate for this portion of I-85 is about 77 percent higher than the average crash rate for comparable roadways across the state, while the fatal crash rate is 80 percent higher.

The project is expected to reduce crash rates by 75 percent and improve traffic flow by alleviating existing bottlenecks. Improvements to the railroad tracks that cross under I-85 will increase track speed by 45 percent and accommodate future rail needs, including the implementation of high-speed rail.

from an economic standpoint, the project has the potential to create or sustain more than 7,000 jobs, and it is expected to result in economic benefits 12 to 17 times its cost. This stretch of I-85 is in a region of the state that has been hard-hit by job losses, with both Davidson and Rowan counties qualifying as economically distressed areas under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965.

Gov. Perdue Joins Statewide Health Leaders at President's Town Hall

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday joined health leaders from across North Carolina to attend President Barack Obama’s health care forum at Broughton High School in Raleigh. The governor invited representatives from the state’s leading health care organizations, including hospitals, research institutions, advocates and minority groups, to attend the event with her.

“I applaud the president for prioritizing health care and for working with Congress to bring about change,” Perdue said. “Here in North Carolina, one in five of our citizens does not have health insurance. We are living the problem, and we are all anxious for a solution.

“When I spoke to President Obama this morning, I told him I believe strongly that reform must take place at the federal level.  We have innovative solutions to providing care in North Carolina, and we have excellent providers, but our finances are stretched to the limit.  We must ensure that the financial burden of a new system cannot fall to the states.  A national health care system must provide the right care, at the right time, at the right place – but at a price that people, and states, can afford.”

Have you never heard the truism "If you think that health care is expensive now, wait until it's free"?

SURELY, any half wit can understand that Obamacare will only serve to FURTHER BANKRUPT this country.

It defies logic that you would condone this proposed catastrophe.

Gov. Perdue's Probabtion Reforms to Improve Public Safety

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced significant reforms to the probation system that will speed the process of obtaining warrants for parole commission violators and put more information into the hands of law enforcement officers on the streets.

These reforms include the following changes:

- The Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission will respond to requests for warrants within 24 hours;

- Probation officers will receive a response to a violation report within that same 24 hours;

- If a warrant is issued it will be entered into the DCI network immediately; and

- Law enforcement officers across North Carolina will have immediate access to information about probationers and prison inmates on their vehicle computers whenever a license check is conducted.

In addition, the governor signed Senate Bill 920, her proposal to:

- Allow probation officers the authority to perform warrantless searches on supervised probationers;

- Give law enforcement officers the ability to perform warrantless searches if they have reasonable suspicion that the probationer is engaged in criminal activity or possesses a weapon without written court permission;

- Allow probation officers limited access to juvenile criminal records, providing them with better insight into the risks offenders pose;

â€œWith these changes, law enforcement and probation officers will have immediate access to probation information and will be better prepared to protect themselves and their communities,â€ Perdue said. â€œThese reforms will strengthen our probation system and make our communities safer.

â€œThis kind of access to information is crucial for the safety of our officers, our law enforcement partners and the public,â€ said Correction Secretary Alvin Keller.  â€œNo longer will probation violators be able to hide from the system.â€

With regard to the health care reform issues being proposed by the president, I sincerely hope that you do NOT support the proposals set forth by him and the democrats. Our country has already sustained major blows to our ecomny due to his short sighted initiatives regarding the financial institutions as well as the auto industry and we can ill afford to have our health care system raped in the same fashion. Please consider opposing any more of his proposals, especially those for health care, as they have not only been ill concieved, but by far they have not been investigated in any fashion. Indeed, the bills themselves have not even been read by him or any member of the house or senate, nor has there been any transparency has has been promised.

Sincerely,

Jeanne Hamilton
Morehead City, NC

Gov. Perdue's Probabtion Reforms to Improve Public Safety

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced significant reforms to the probation system that will speed the process of obtaining warrants for parole commission violators and put more information into the hands of law enforcement officers on the streets.
These reforms include the following changes:
- The Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission will respond to requests for warrants within 24 hours;
- Probation officers will receive a response to a violation report within that same 24 hours;
- If a warrant is issued it will be entered into the DCI network immediately; and
- Law enforcement officers across North Carolina will have immediate access to information about probationers and prison inmates on their vehicle computers whenever a license check is conducted.
In addition, the governor signed Senate Bill 920, her proposal to:
- Allow probation officers the authority to perform warrantless searches on supervised probationers;
- Give law enforcement officers the ability to perform warrantless searches if they have reasonable suspicion that the probationer is engaged in criminal activity or possesses a weapon without written court permission;
- Allow probation officers limited access to juvenile criminal records, providing them with better insight into the risks offenders pose;
â€œWith these changes, law enforcement and probation officers will have immediate access to probation information and will be better prepared to protect themselves and their communities,â€ Perdue said. â€œThese reforms will strengthen our probation system and make our communities safer.
â€œThis kind of access to information is crucial for the safety of our officers, our law enforcement partners and the public,â€ said Correction Secretary Alvin Keller.  â€œNo longer will probation violators be able to hide from the system.â€
Also, Governor Perdue announced that information from the Department of Correction offender database of more than 1.1 million criminal offenders is being shared with the law enforcement community via the DCI network.
Since the computer system for law enforcement vehicles was activated on June 24, officers have entered roughly 128,000 queries, and 1,146 probation absconders have been arrested.

Gov. Perdue Signs Bill Establishing Stricter Safety Oversight of Coal Ash Ponds

Gov. Perdue today signed Senate Bill 1004, increasing the safety oversight of coal ash ponds in North Carolina. The legislation subjects dams that create coal ash ponds to direct inspection by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources. 
â€œBecause of potential risk posed by the location of North Carolinaâ€™s coal ash ponds, we must provide greater oversight and more frequent inspections,â€ said Gov. Perdue. â€œThis legislation will keep our citizens safer and our dams more secure.â€
In June, the Environmental Protection Agency released a list of 44 â€œhigh-hazardâ€ coal ash waste dams across the county. Twelve of these dams were located in North Carolina, more than any other state. A â€œhigh hazardâ€ designation was created in the 1980â€™s for coal ash impoundments and other similar dams that are near densely populated areas, downstream water supplies, important public utilities or primary highways because of the potential impact of a damâ€™s failure.  The designation does not reflect the structural condition of the dam. 
Currently, power companies are only required to file reports every five years by private engineers on the structural conditions of the dams.  The reports are filed with the N.C. Utilities Commission and the impoundments are exempt from regulation under the N.C. Dam Safety Act.
This legislation, sponsored by Sen. David Hoyle (D-Guilford) and led by Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) in the House, places coal ash dams and ponds under the regulation of the Dam Safety Act. This means the structures will be more closely regulated, and requires a state inspection every two years. 

15 Contracts Totaling More Than $29 Million Awarded for Highway Projects Across NC

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced that 15 contracts totaling $29.3 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including seven projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The contracts were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.
â€œThese projects will stimulate economic growth by creating and maintaining jobs as we enhance safety and keep our people traveling,â€ Perdue said.
According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.

NC Submits Grant Application for Economic Recovery Funding for I-85 Improvement Project

North Carolina has submitted a grant application for $300 million in discretionary grant money included in the ARRA to use for the I-85 Corridor Improvement Project, which includes replacing the I-85 bridge over the Yadkin River, in Davidson and Rowan counties. Comprehensive information about the project is available on a new Web site, <http://www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/>www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/.
â€œReplacing this bridge is critical to preserving safety, travel and commerce along this vital interstate route and is an ideal candidate for recovery funding,â€ Perdue said. â€œThese improvements are essential to ensuring that I-85 continues to move people and goods safely and effectively on a regional, statewide and national level.â€
Perdue has been working with Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and North Carolinaâ€™s congressional delegation to obtain funding for the project. It also has received tremendous support from local communities and business leaders advocating for the project. Nearly 100 letters and resolutions of endorsement have been received to date and can be viewed on the project Web site.
The I-85 Corridor Improvement Project will complete a comprehensive overhaul of the highway, bridge and rail infrastructure located along 6.8 miles of I-85 from north of Long Ferry Road (Exit 81) in Rowan County to U.S. 29-52-70/I-85 Business (Exit 87) in Davidson County. The project would be completed under two design-build contracts, which allow project teams of designers and contractors to conduct design and construction work simultaneously to expedite completion, at an estimated cost of more than $300 million.
I-85 is the most direct and heavily traveled route between Richmond and Atlanta. The stretch of highway included in this project currently carries nearly 70,000 vehicles per day, with traffic counts projected to more than double by 2030. Trucks account for 26 percent of the traffic along this portion of I-85.
Right now, this stretch has only two lanes in each direction, with narrow shoulders, sharp curves and closely spaced interchanges. The existing I-85 Yadkin River Bridge is outdated and narrow and is currently rated in poor condition and classified as both structurally deficient (having elements that need to be monitored and/or repaired) and functionally obsolete (outdated in design).
The total crash rate for this portion of I-85 is about 77 percent higher than the average crash rate for comparable roadways across the state, while the fatal crash rate is 80 percent higher.
The project is expected to reduce crash rates by 75 percent and improve traffic flow by alleviating existing bottlenecks. Improvements to the railroad tracks that cross under I-85 will increase track speed by 45 percent and accommodate future rail needs, including the implementation of high-speed rail.
from an economic standpoint, the project has the potential to create or sustain more than 7,000 jobs, and it is expected to result in economic benefits 12 to 17 times its cost. This stretch of I-85 is in a region of the state that has been hard-hit by job losses, with both Davidson and Rowan counties qualifying as economically distressed areas under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965.

Gov. Perdue Joins Statewide Health Leaders at President's Town Hall

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday joined health leaders from across North Carolina to attend President Barack Obamaâ€™s health care forum at Broughton High School in Raleigh. The governor invited representatives from the stateâ€™s leading health care organizations, including hospitals, research institutions, advocates and minority groups, to attend the event with her.
â€œI applaud the president for prioritizing health care and for working with Congress to bring about change,â€ Perdue said. â€œHere in North Carolina, one in five of our citizens does not have health insurance. We are living the problem, and we are all anxious for a solution.
â€œWhen I spoke to President Obama this morning, I told him I believe strongly that reform must take place at the federal level.  We have innovative solutions to providing care in North Carolina, and we have excellent providers, but our finances are stretched to the limit.  We must ensure that the financial burden of a new system cannot fall to the states.  A national health care system must provide the right care, at the right time, at the right place â€“ but at a price that people, and states, can afford.â€

Gov. Perdue,

I think you better take a stronger listen to what the North Carolinians are saying about Obama's Healthcare Gov't takeover. I don't think you are hearing us correctly!! We do NOT and will NOT accept the Government taking over our medical solutions and considerations. I do NOT trust the Government and I sure am not wanting total takeover of every aspect of our nation. I am not wanting this Progressivism that this Administration is forcing on us.
As for areas that need improving, one that is in dire need of improvement is the length of time it takes to have a disability court hearing. Twenty-one months average is a very long and actually ridiculous length of time to wait when you are in a chronic debilitating condition. Are we supposed to just curl up and die while the State takes almost 2 years just to give you a hearing date? That's not fair.
When anyone of our politicians need medical attention they get the best and they get it instantly. We have to wait. And then when we are in a condition where we can not work, we are forced to wait for about 2 years just to get our day in court. And that's when you do have an attorney fighting for you. Our Government is not doing what we have elected them to do. It's not the nation I once knew.

The I-85 Corridor Improvement Project will complete a comprehensive overhaul of the highway, bridge and rail infrastructure located along 6.8 miles of I-85 from north of Long Ferry Road (Exit 81) in Rowan County to U.S. 29-52-70/I-85 Business (Exit 87) in Davidson County. The project would be completed under two design-build contracts, which allow project teams of designers and contractors to conduct design and construction work simultaneously to expedite completion, at an estimated cost of more than $300 million.
I-85 is the most direct and heavily traveled route between Richmond and Atlanta. The stretch of highway included in this project currently carries nearly 70,000 vehicles per day, with traffic counts projected to more than double by 2030. Trucks account for 26 percent of the traffic along this portion of I-85.
Right now, this stretch has only two lanes in each direction, with narrow shoulders, sharp curves and closely spaced interchanges. The existing I-85 Yadkin River Bridge is outdated and narrow and is currently rated in poor condition and classified as both structurally deficient (having elements that need to be monitored and/or repaired) and functionally obsolete (outdated in design).
The total crash rate for this portion of I-85 is about 77 percent higher than the average crash rate for comparable roadways across the state, while the fatal crash rate is 80 percent higher.
The project is expected to reduce crash rates by 75 percent and improve traffic flow by alleviating existing bottlenecks. Improvements to the railroad tracks that cross under I-85 will increase track speed by 45 percent and accommodate future rail needs, including the implementation of high-speed rail.
from an economic standpoint, the project has the potential to create or sustain more than 7,000 jobs, and it is expected to result in economic benefits 12 to 17 times its cost. This stretch of I-85 is in a region of the state that has been hard-hit by job losses, with both Davidson and Rowan counties qualifying as economically distressed areas under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965.

Gov. Perdue Joins Statewide Health Leaders at President's Town Hall

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday joined health leaders from across North Carolina to attend President Barack Obamaâ€™s health care forum at Broughton High School in Raleigh. The governor invited representatives from the stateâ€™s leading health care organizations, including hospitals, research institutions, advocates and minority groups, to attend the event with her.
â€œI applaud the president for prioritizing health care and for working with Congress to bring about change,â€ Perdue said. â€œHere in North Carolina, one in five of our citizens does not have health insurance. We are living the problem, and we are all anxious for a solution.
â€œWhen I spoke to President Obama this morning, I told him I believe strongly that reform must take place at the federal level.  We have innovative solutions to providing care in North Carolina, and we have excellent providers, but our finances are stretched to the limit.  We must ensure that the financial burden of a new system cannot fall to the states.  A national health care system must provide the right care, at the right time, at the right place â€“ but at a price that people, and states, can afford.â€

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced significant reforms to the probation system that will speed the process of obtaining warrants for parole commission violators and put more information into the hands of law enforcement officers on the streets.

> These reforms include the following changes:

> - The Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission will respond to requests for warrants within 24 hours;

> - Probation officers will receive a response to a violation report within that same 24 hours;

> - If a warrant is issued it will be entered into the DCI network immediately; and

> - Law enforcement officers across North Carolina will have immediate access to information about probationers and prison inmates on their vehicle computers whenever a license check is conducted.

> In addition, the governor signed Senate Bill 920, her proposal to:

> - Allow probation officers the authority to perform warrantless searches on supervised probationers;

> - Give law enforcement officers the ability to perform warrantless searches if they have reasonable suspicion that the probationer is engaged in criminal activity or possesses a weapon without written court permission;

> - Allow probation officers limited access to juvenile criminal records, providing them with better insight into the risks offenders pose;

> “With these changes, law enforcement and probation officers will have immediate access to probation information and will be better prepared to protect themselves and their communities,” Perdue said. “These reforms will strengthen our probation system and make our communities safer.

> “This kind of access to information is crucial for the safety of our officers, our law enforcement partners and the public,” said Correction Secretary Alvin Keller.  “No longer will probation violators be able to hide from the system.”

> Also, Governor Perdue announced that information from the Department of Correction offender database of more than 1.1 million criminal offenders is being shared with the law enforcement community via the DCI network.

> Since the computer system for law enforcement vehicles was activated on June 24, officers have entered roughly 128,000 queries, and 1,146 probation absconders have been arrested.

> Gov. Perdue Signs Bill Establishing Stricter Safety Oversight of Coal Ash Ponds

Gov. Perdue today signed Senate Bill 1004, increasing the safety oversight of coal ash ponds in North Carolina. The legislation subjects dams that create coal ash ponds to direct inspection by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources. 

> “Because of potential risk posed by the location of North Carolina’s coal ash ponds, we must provide greater oversight and more frequent inspections,” said Gov. Perdue. “This legislation will keep our citizens safer and our dams more secure.”

> In June, the Environmental Protection Agency released a list of 44 “high-hazard” coal ash waste dams across the county. Twelve of these dams were located in North Carolina, more than any other state. A “high hazard” designation was created in the 1980’s for coal ash impoundments and other similar dams that are near densely populated areas, downstream water supplies, important public utilities or primary highways because of the potential impact of a dam’s failure.  The designation does not reflect the structural condition of the dam. 

> Currently, power companies are only required to file reports every five years by private engineers on the structural conditions of the dams.  The reports are filed with the N.C. Utilities Commission and the impoundments are exempt from regulation under the N.C. Dam Safety Act.

> This legislation, sponsored by Sen. David Hoyle (D-Guilford) and led by Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) in the House, places coal ash dams and ponds under the regulation of the Dam Safety Act. This means the structures will be more closely regulated, and requires a state inspection every two years. 

> 15 Contracts Totaling More Than $29 Million Awarded for Highway Projects Across NC

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced that 15 contracts totaling $29.3 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including seven projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The contracts were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.

> “These projects will stimulate economic growth by creating and maintaining jobs as we enhance safety and keep our people traveling,” Perdue said.

> According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.

> For more information about funding for infrastructure improvements in North Carolina, as well as other NCDOT projects and activities, visit <http://www.ncdot.gov>www.ncdot.gov.

> NC Submits Grant Application for Economic Recovery Funding for I-85 Improvement Project

North Carolina has submitted a grant application for $300 million in discretionary grant money included in the ARRA to use for the I-85 Corridor Improvement Project, which includes replacing the I-85 bridge over the Yadkin River, in Davidson and Rowan counties. Comprehensive information about the project is available on a new Web site, <http://www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/>www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/.

> “Replacing this bridge is critical to preserving safety, travel and commerce along this vital interstate route and is an ideal candidate for recovery funding,” Perdue said. “These improvements are essential to ensuring that I-85 continues to move people and goods safely and effectively on a regional, statewide and national level.”

> Perdue has been working with Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and North Carolina’s congressional delegation to obtain funding for the project.

Such good, strong work in a difficult fiscal environment. Best wishes that budget resolution will come this week-end. Thanks for strong convictions about K-12 and early childhood education,  Hopefully we can lose as little momentum as possible given the terrible climate we're in , move forward and concentrate on economic revival and then "catching up" and improving those areas necessarily diminished this time.  I think that our opportunities in North Carolina for aviation/distribution related industries,bio-tech and nano-science new initiativesand some niche/creative returns to manufacturing  are really good---so long as we educate productive young citizens to such levels that they can bring sufficent expertise and will to the new industries,  Thanks to the Governor for courageous, knowledgeable actions.  Dot Kearns, Guilford County

Dear Governor Perdue,

    The Health Care Plan being forced on the American people is completely unacceptable. America has been a leader in innovative health care treatment. The current plan will end our leadership role in providing the quality health care currently available to us.  The figures coming out of the White House are incredibly inaccurate and are designed to "Sell" the President's plan.  Current polls show the American people DO NOT WANT a government takeover of healthcare.
    If the President believes the American people think he is telling us the truth when he tells us "Like your doctor.........keep your doctor, Like your current Plan...........Keep your current Plan" He is sadly mistaken!
    Any politician who supports the current plan will most certainly be looking for work when his/her term is up.  Please do not underestimate the American people.

                                                                    Sincerely,
                                                                          Robert M. Afflitto

> Gov. Perdue's Probabtion Reforms to Improve Public Safety

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced significant reforms to the probation system that will speed the process of obtaining warrants for parole commission violators and put more information into the hands of law enforcement officers on the streets.

> These reforms include the following changes:

> - The Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission will respond to requests for warrants within 24 hours;

> - Probation officers will receive a response to a violation report within that same 24 hours;

> - If a warrant is issued it will be entered into the DCI network immediately; and

> - Law enforcement officers across North Carolina will have immediate access to information about probationers and prison inmates on their vehicle computers whenever a license check is conducted.

> In addition, the governor signed Senate Bill 920, her proposal to:

> - Allow probation officers the authority to perform warrantless searches on supervised probationers;

> - Give law enforcement officers the ability to perform warrantless searches if they have reasonable suspicion that the probationer is engaged in criminal activity or possesses a weapon without written court permission;

> - Allow probation officers limited access to juvenile criminal records, providing them with better insight into the risks offenders pose;

> “With these changes, law enforcement and probation officers will have immediate access to probation information and will be better prepared to protect themselves and their communities,” Perdue said. “These reforms will strengthen our probation system and make our communities safer.

> “This kind of access to information is crucial for the safety of our officers, our law enforcement partners and the public,” said Correction Secretary Alvin Keller.  “No longer will probation violators be able to hide from the system.”

> Also, Governor Perdue announced that information from the Department of Correction offender database of more than 1.1 million criminal offenders is being shared with the law enforcement community via the DCI network.

> Since the computer system for law enforcement vehicles was activated on June 24, officers have entered roughly 128,000 queries, and 1,146 probation absconders have been arrested.

> Gov. Perdue Signs Bill Establishing Stricter Safety Oversight of Coal Ash Ponds

Gov. Perdue today signed Senate Bill 1004, increasing the safety oversight of coal ash ponds in North Carolina. The legislation subjects dams that create coal ash ponds to direct inspection by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources. 

> “Because of potential risk posed by the location of North Carolina’s coal ash ponds, we must provide greater oversight and more frequent inspections,” said Gov. Perdue. “This legislation will keep our citizens safer and our dams more secure.”

> In June, the Environmental Protection Agency released a list of 44 “high-hazard” coal ash waste dams across the county. Twelve of these dams were located in North Carolina, more than any other state. A “high hazard” designation was created in the 1980’s for coal ash impoundments and other similar dams that are near densely populated areas, downstream water supplies, important public utilities or primary highways because of the potential impact of a dam’s failure.  The designation does not reflect the structural condition of the dam. 

> Currently, power companies are only required to file reports every five years by private engineers on the structural conditions of the dams.  The reports are filed with the N.C. Utilities Commission and the impoundments are exempt from regulation under the N.C. Dam Safety Act.

> This legislation, sponsored by Sen. David Hoyle (D-Guilford) and led by Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) in the House, places coal ash dams and ponds under the regulation of the Dam Safety Act. This means the structures will be more closely regulated, and requires a state inspection every two years. 

> 15 Contracts Totaling More Than $29 Million Awarded for Highway Projects Across NC

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced that 15 contracts totaling $29.3 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including seven projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The contracts were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.

> “These projects will stimulate economic growth by creating and maintaining jobs as we enhance safety and keep our people traveling,” Perdue said.

> According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.

> For more information about funding for infrastructure improvements in North Carolina, as well as other NCDOT projects and activities, visit <http://www.ncdot.gov>www.ncdot.gov.

> NC Submits Grant Application for Economic Recovery Funding for I-85 Improvement Project

North Carolina has submitted a grant application for $300 million in discretionary grant money included in the ARRA to use for the I-85 Corridor Improvement Project, which includes replacing the I-85 bridge over the Yadkin River, in Davidson and Rowan counties. Comprehensive information about the project is available on a new Web site, <http://www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/>www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/.

> “Replacing this bridge is critical to preserving safety, travel and commerce along this vital interstate route and is an ideal candidate for recovery funding,” Perdue said. “These improvements are essential to ensuring that I-85 continues to move people and goods safely and effectively on a regional, statewide and national level.”

> Perdue has been working with Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and North Carolina’s congressional delegation to obtain funding for the project. It also has received tremendous support from local communities and business leaders advocating for the project. Nearly 100 letters and resolutions of endorsement have been received to date and can be viewed on the project Web site.

> The I-85 Corridor Improvement Project will complete a comprehensive overhaul of the highway, bridge and rail infrastructure located along 6.8 miles of I-85 from north of Long Ferry Road (Exit 81) in Rowan County to U.S. 29-52-70/I-85 Business (Exit 87) in Davidson County. The project would be completed under two design-build contracts, which allow project teams of designers and contractors to conduct design and construction work simultaneously to expedite completion, at an estimated cost of more than $300 million.

> I-85 is the most direct and heavily traveled route between Richmond and Atlanta. The stretch of highway included in this project currently carries nearly 70,000 vehicles per day, with traffic counts projected to more than double by 2030. Trucks account for 26 percent of the traffic along this portion of I-85.

> Right now, this stretch has only two lanes in each direction, with narrow shoulders, sharp curves and closely spaced interchanges. The existing I-85 Yadkin River Bridge is outdated and narrow and is currently rated in poor condition and classified as both structurally deficient (having elements that need to be monitored and/or repaired) and functionally obsolete (outdated in design).

> The total crash rate for this portion of I-85 is about 77 percent higher than the average crash rate for comparable roadways across the state, while the fatal crash rate is 80 percent higher.

> The project is expected to reduce crash rates by 75 percent and improve traffic flow by alleviating existing bottlenecks. Improvements to the railroad tracks that cross under I-85 will increase track speed by 45 percent and accommodate future rail needs, including the implementation of high-speed rail.

> From an economic standpoint, the project has the potential to create or sustain more than 7,000 jobs, and it is expected to result in economic benefits 12 to 17 times its cost. This stretch of I-85 is in a region of the state that has been hard-hit by job losses, with both Davidson and Rowan counties qualifying as economically distressed areas under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965.

> Gov. Perdue Joins Statewide Health Leaders at President's Town Hall

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday joined health leaders from across North Carolina to attend President Barack Obama’s health care forum at Broughton High School in Raleigh. The governor invited representatives from the state’s leading health care organizations, including hospitals, research institutions, advocates and minority groups, to attend the event with her.

> “I applaud the president for prioritizing health care and for working with Congress to bring about change,” Perdue said. “Here in North Carolina, one in five of our citizens does not have health insurance. We are living the problem, and we are all anxious for a solution.

> “When I spoke to President Obama this morning, I told him I believe strongly that reform must take place at the federal level.  We have innovative solutions to providing care in North Carolina, and we have excellent providers, but our finances are stretched to the limit.  We must ensure that the financial burden of a new system cannot fall to the states.  A national health care system must provide the right care, at the right time, at the right place – but at a price that people, and states, can afford.”
