Dear Governor Perdue:
Thank you for your support of increased funding for the education of all students from K-12. A sound education and access to health care are basic needs of society and without them our state cannot progress. I am a supporter of Rep. Pricey Harrison's bill, HB 362, which would prohibit the solicitation by the UNC system and by the community colleges of information concerning a student's immigration status. I am aware of the excess of heat over light being shed by political opponents on this issue.
I am a retired cardiologist who volunteers at a church-related clinic here in Raleigh. Recently I spoke with a Mexican woman whose children are in the situation which this bill addresses. They were brought at age 4 or less to this country†by their parents. They have completed or will soon complete secondary school here and desire higher education, which they are denied by current policies. We must not try to do immigration reform on the backs of innocent young people. To prevent them from fulfilling their potential is an offense against them personally and denies the greater community the benefit of their educated talents, plus their bilingual, bicultural background, which in themselves is an asset in the modern world. Immigration reform is a multi-faceted, complex issue and must be dealt with by the U.S. President and Congress. Mean-spirited, short-sighted negative sanctions against young people are not the way to do it.
Thanks for your thoughtful and perhaps prayerful consideration of all aspects of this issue. All best wishes for your success with the many demands of being our Governor in this very difficult time.

I am a property owner at Kure Beach, NC and am writing to urge all of you to support Senate Bill 6 and House

Bill 26. This legislation is for a Stay of the Beach Plan †insurance rate increases as high as 17% and for wind and hail

Deductables raised to 2% of insured value.



The North Carolina Coast creates benefits for all North Carolinians and should not be forced to bear the full impact

of this economic blow.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am very disappointed that your administration and the Division
of Air Quality have accepted Duke Energy's request to reclassify
the Cliffside coal plant expansion as a "minor" source of
pollution. This pollution permit could allow Duke Energy to
avoid compliance with the Clean Air Act.

This is also not in line with your campaign pledge last year to
make North Carolina a leader in clean energy.

Mr. Gunter,



WCHS can give out all the constructive criticism it feels necessary, but WCHS canít take any in return to make thing better. Strange!!!



I tried to talk with both you and Mr. Ramon at the inception back in November or December of 2007, where Mr. Ramon promised me that he would fix my concerns. That you personally call me and told me that you were privately investigation my concerns over one year ago.



I feel that I need to ask the question:† What type and form of Human Services agency is being run in Wake County North Carolina? As from what I have personally experienced is inconsistent with the by laws of the U.S. Justice Department, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services out of Atlanta George.



Jacqueline family is raising this concerns to fix these issues. †Instead WCHS, the State of North Carolina, and all the person in power, twist, distort, defile, berate, take out of context, and ABUSE THERE POSITION OF POWER, CONTROL, AND ATHORITY to the demise, disadvantage, destruction of the concerned parties. †I feel that WCHS is acting beyond the scope of itís charter, and authority with my daughter, in regards to who and how she was on October 1st 2007 thru July 28th 2001. As Jacqueline has never isolated, not visited with, and not kept her bonds with her African American family Ever in her natural born life. Jacqueline has never been imprisoned within the state of North Carolina either, where as she is not free to travel outside the state.



My daughters first language is Flemish, then French, and then English.

My daughters religion in Baptist not non damnation TV.† Our pastor just preached last Sunday about the effects of TV ministry taking away for the personable body of the church in itself, and the body of the sprit in the congregation.

My daughter never had a broken down bicycle in her life, or hand me downs, or had to fight with a sibling or any of her needs. No money in her pocked to buy a stick of bubble gum.



And we never sent my daughter to school with a 102 fever, in the cold, or failed to take her to the doctor, pediatrician, eye-doctors, or any medical care provider. In fact we took her too much, and that my wife was to over protective, as well as my self. In particular with our daughters vocational, family, and medical needs, and after school programs, trips, library visits, college funds, and maintain bonds, visits, and contact her family provided what ever she needed as a village does to raise a child. Like it use to be when I was growing up, that the neighbors would see that the children of the community were cared for as though I was their own flesh and blood.† Which was not maintained by the Judge, Mr. Singer, or the WCHS Social Workers.



Jacqueline feels betrayed, deceived, and hurt. In that WCHS, LCSW Peggy Wallace provide clinical services upon my daughter or over one year telling her that she would be able to go home to her step-mother and father once they completed some services. That in fact they had completed back in early June, July, and August of 2008 in the commonwealth of Virginia, and some in Wake county to the satisfaction of the licensed trained facilitator of those service. Which the State of North Carolina refused to acknowledge, respect, accuracy report on, obtain progress notes, or grand full faith in credit too. Because the father and step-mother, grandmother, grandfather, friends relative, aunts, uncles, and cousin of my daughter are of African American decent, and the mother is of the majority.



My wife, my mom, my dad, and all of us feel betrayed by the State of North Carolina, as persons of color, persons of monitory, persons of European decent.



Why hasnít WCHS address what really and truly happened to the mothers other three babies, toddler, and infants true story of abuse, neglect, and dependency from the Administration of Childrenís Services, 8 year history with Child protective Services of the State of New York where she lost all her children too, by forced removal, and involuntary termination of her parental rights..† Where three or four different courts of competent jurisdiction on at lease three different and separate occasion, have established the dangerous propensity of this parent. To the effect that the State of Texas, under the rules and regulation of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told WCHS that, this parent has serious issues with her past, and present criminal convictions, and not caring for any of her other three children for over 14 years, or providing any finical support?



Yet this parent is obtaining, all expense paid tripe



A.††††† It is the general feeling and consensus, Jacquelineís African American and European African family, friends, relative, and her church in Hampton Virginia that Wake County Human Services hates, disregards, and totally refused to grand full faith and credit to anything that come out of Virginia. Which was found to by Jacquelineís Home State by a court of competent jurisdiction.



B.††††† Where as from the inception of this matter of my daughter Jacqueline Francoise Davis, †That Danielle Doyle, Janney Magri, Lisa Seller, Peggy Wallace, Attorney Albert J. Signer, Attorney Hal Anthony Morris, Attorney Charlotte Mitchell, Attorney Richard Croutharmel and the Honorable Judge Eric Craig Chasse, have been practicing racial, †gender, religious based discrimination against my daughter, her parents clinicians in Virginia, the courts in Virginia, and the family friends and relative of Jacqueline Francoise Davis who all live and reside in Virginia.



C.††††† It is the general feeling, concern, and consensus of Jacqueline and her African American, and European African the family, friends, relative, at the underlying issue here is money ìfederal fundsî & ìtax payer fundsî where as WCHS is refusing to spend any of those allotted funds for minority in Virginia to help my daughter or her African American family. †Instead WCHS forum shoppers and discriminates in volition of the civil rights act, with a non-minority majority parent in this matter on the basis of race, and gender.



It is the general feeling, concern, and consensus of Jacqueline and her African American, and European African the family, friends, relatives, that John Tanner, Warren Ludwig, and WCHS are funneling those federal funds to non-minority contractor that are only willing to play ball with WCHS in their professional services in childrenís protective services, as employs under the guise of independent contractor.



1.†††††† My daughter feel that she as been abuse, neglected, and dependant by the care and custody of her foster parents Ms. William and Ms. Pembroke.

2.†††††† I my wife, mother, father, family, friends, and relative also feel that these foster parents, have neglected my daughter mental healthy, welfare, and bonds and ties to her family, and minor society against her wishes and her will.

3.†††††† Jacquelineís family has been, and is being subjected to racial and gender base discrimination in violation to Jacqueline constitution right of maintain her African American roots within in her family. Where as my wife and my mother, as well as all these other African Americans were a vital part of Jacqueline life. Until WCHS became involved with it tortuous third party interference, with contact, visitation, written communication, freedom of speech, freedom from isolation and imprisonment of my daughter by your agency.



1.†††††† I feel that both you and Mr. Rajano are public servants, and that you and Mr. Ramon have been intentionally making yourselves unavailable to the African American family, friends, and relative of my daughter for almost two years now.

2.†††††† I know that WCHS has used and abused federal funds in this matter to discriminate against my daughter on the basis of Race, Gender, National origin, †disability, in altering the fragile, impressionable mind of a 6 year old, now going on 8 years old. To further the racially, and gender based discriminatory practices of those in power and control at WCHS in this matter.



By identify some areaís of concerns of violations of Title VII, WCHS, itís agents, and the State of North Carolina has turned against my daughter, in all her rights to her African roots , family, friends, relativeís and love one by any means necessary. Because I choose to exercise my constitutional rights to try to make thing better.

Dear Gov. Perdue:

I am emailing you with concerns re: the apparently approved 2009 insurance
rate adjustments to the North Carolina Beach Plan and Homeowners Policies.

I have just retired and moved from Indiana to Kure Beach. There are many
reasons why, and I may not be fully informed, but it seems that the rate
adjustments are particularly "heavy" on those of us who choose to live close
to the ocean. Since Kure Beach is a part of the entire state, it would seem
to me that the state would not impose on part of the state a different
standard or assessment of fees? After all, other areas of this fine state
can experience ravages of nature in ways that the coastal areas do not.

I would ask that you support efforts to stay the Beach Plan increases.

Thank you for taking time to read this email.

Sincerely yours,

It has come to my attention that a series of bills either has been or soon will be introduced sponsored by extreme Animal Rights activists, HSUS, and PETA.† Most of our citizens and farmers donít want interference in our private lives or personal decisions regarding care of and reproductive status of our pets.† I would urge you to use the North Carolina Responsible Animal Owners rather than HSUS or local activists for your animal related problems.† Responsible animal owners do want Animal Welfare but not Animal Rights imposed limits and restrictions on our pets, our tables and our clothing.†

Subject: use of gas chambers in county animal shelters

Comment: I received an e-mail and looked on the internet and was sickened and appalled to find out that my home state (my grandfather Ben E Douglas was mayor of Charlotte) allowed the barbaric, sadistic use of gas chambers to euthanize unwanted pets. Who could possibly justify this procedure? Would they take their children and grandchildren to see this horrific act that they are responsible for? And are they proud enough of this decision to tell their friends and neighbors what they authorized? Whoever made this decision or voted for this procedure should have to be present when it's done to witness what they are doing to this animal- in their face. What kind of person could do this? the kind of sick sadistic people who kill and rape children. THIS MUST BE STOPPED PERIOD. Create a law to have all pets neutered/spayed unless they are professional breeders who pay very large amounts for liscence to do so. If you're not stopping this you are a killer.

Subject: NC Needs Smoke-free

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: As your constituent, I urge you to support House Bill 2/Senate Bill 205, legislation that will make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. Please keep the bill strong in its proposed form without amendments. Exposure to secondhand smoke is a health hazard that causes or makes worse a wide range of adverse health effects, including heart attacks, cancer, and asthma. I believe that all workers should be protected from secondhand smoke in the workplace. My support for a smoke-free environment is not in the minority. North Carolinians are voicing their support for smoke-free policies. According to an Elon University poll in 2006, 86 percent of North Carolinians agree or strongly agree that employees in North Carolina should be able to work in a smoke-free environment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that as little as 30 minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. No one should have to risk their life to keep a job. Non-smokers routinely exposed to secondhand smoke have a 50% increase in risk of developing lung cancer. By helping to prohibit smoking in public places and worksites, you will play an important role in ensuring an immediate and dramatic impact on the health of everyone living and visiting our Tarheel state. In addition to saving lives, smoke-free policies save health care costs. A recent study in Pueblo, Colorado found the rate of heart attacks declined 41% after a smoke-free law went into effect. Not only did fewer people have heart attacks, but this had a rippling effect on public and private health care costs. We can't afford to wait any longer to breathe smoke-free indoor air. I urge you to vote yes for HB 2 and keep this legislation strong in its proposed form without amendments. Sincerely, Kim Carnes 531 Silversmith Ln Charlotte, NC 28270-0872

Subject: NC Needs Smoke-free

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: As your constituent, I urge you to support House Bill 2/Senate Bill 205, legislation that will make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. Please keep the bill strong in its proposed form without amendments. Exposure to secondhand smoke is a health hazard that causes or makes worse a wide range of adverse health effects, including heart attacks, cancer, and asthma. I believe that all workers should be protected from secondhand smoke in the workplace. My support for a smoke-free environment is not in the minority. North Carolinians are voicing their support for smoke-free policies. According to an Elon University poll in 2006, 86 percent of North Carolinians agree or strongly agree that employees in North Carolina should be able to work in a smoke-free environment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that as little as 30 minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. No one should have to risk their life to keep a job. Non-smokers routinely exposed to secondhand smoke have a 50% increase in risk of developing lung cancer. By helping to prohibit smoking in public places and worksites, you will play an important role in ensuring an immediate and dramatic impact on the health of everyone living and visiting our Tarheel state. In addition to saving lives, smoke-free policies save health care costs. A recent study in Pueblo, Colorado found the rate of heart attacks declined 41% after a smoke-free law went into effect. Not only did fewer people have heart attacks, but this had a rippling effect on public and private health care costs. We can't afford to wait any longer to breathe smoke-free indoor air. I urge you to vote yes for HB 2 and keep this legislation strong in its proposed form without amendments. Sincerely, Samantha Simmons 1985 Colington Rd Kill Devil Hills, NC 27948-8038

Subject: Domestic Violence

Comment: Dear Governor, I read the Star-news newspaper yesterday and there was a certain article that drew my attention. The headline alone said it all! ‚ÄúDomestic Violence kills 131 People in N.C. in 2008‚Äù. I‚Äôve been going through a Domestic Situation myself, but have come to a dead end road. This letter will be a bit lengthy, but I hope my situation will draw your attention and somehow be able to give me answers and advice on what steps to take from here, because I am out of options. My Husband and I separated in March of 2008. I moved out of the residence with my 3 children and started a life on my own for the first time. I started over, it was a new stepping stone in my life to a brighter future‚Ä¶or so I thought. My Husband did not agree with the divorce. He was against it and didn‚Äôt want our marriage to end. I‚Äôm sure the reason to you why I left is irrelevant, but it had to do with all the things that I‚Äôve been through throughout our marriage (2 years). It started with verbal abuse, all the classic signs that start the base of a Domestic Violence case (I know because I am a Police Officer). I would have never thought I would fall into the situation I am in now and I would have never thought that I would become a victim of Domestic Violence. I was in denial. I thought to myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a strong minded woman, a mother, a wife, a Police Officer, there is no chance on earth I would ever let myself get into this predicament‚Äù. Here I am, head first with no one to turn to because my options have ran out. ‚ÄúNorth Carolina‚Äôs attorney general said Thursday that domestic violence killed 131 people in the state last year, and he‚Äôs urging victims to get court-ordered protection against their abusers‚Äù.- Those words gave me hope to what I though was a never ending battle with no results or positive outcome. Here‚Äôs my story: My situation is very different from normal Domestic Violence cases. I became a Police Officer in March of 2006. It was the greatest achievement I have conquered in my life (besides my children). I was sworn in as a Patrol Officer on March 24,2006 with the Leland Police Department. My husband and I were married for approximately 2 months at that point. That‚Äôs when it started. After giving birth to our Daughter in October of 2006 the verbal abuse got worse and resulted in Property Damage. My husband came home from school (he wasn‚Äôt working at the time) and began to yell at me for a reason I still do not understand to this day. I decided for my safety, it would be best if I left for a couple of hours so he can cool down and we could talk like adults and handle whatever it was that he was mad about. He wouldn‚Äôt let me leave in our family vehicle so I took my patrol car instead. He ran out and hit the back of the Patrol car as I was leaving and caused $400.00 worth of damage to the Patrol car. I was devastated. I reported it to the Sgt on shift that night and I told him I was not staying at my home that night and I would find other sleeping arrangements. How could he do this? I was embarrassed, I was shocked, I was scared, I was so confused. What do I do now? I‚Äôve seen this time and time again, not happen to me, but on calls for service while I was on shift. I knew what was right, I know what I should have done, but I was in denial. I thought ‚Äúit was just an accident, I probably provoked him to do it by walking out during an argument‚Äù. Looking back now and seeing the things I‚Äôve seen‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.I sounded just like ‚Äúthem‚Äù. It was all my fault, he won‚Äôt do it again, he didn‚Äôt hit me so it‚Äôs not that bad etc. Needless to say, I stayed. The verbal abuse continued, but I always wore a smile on my face and never let it appear to bother me. Little things continued to happen, but I just brushed them off and pretended everything was going to be ok and that his behavior was normal. I was terminated from the Leland Police Department a year after my employment. The Chief knew I was having problems at home and decided for my safety and work performance that I should focus on resolving the issues at home because my ‚Äúmind was not where it should be while at work‚Äù. He was absolutely right! My mind was far away constantly thinking about everything that was falling apart in my family. I started employment with the Pender County Sheriffs Office in June of 2007. Things were better at home, I was able to focus on work and my children. My husband decided he wanted to become a Police Officer (he was in the military for 4 years and was medically discharged for PTSD and other various mental and physical issues). He made it through the academy after the 2nd try and applied with Pender County. He applied at various other departments but they sent denial of employment letters. Each time I would check the mail and see a letter from a department he applied at, I would open them. I know it was wrong, but he would be outraged and take his anger out on me if he knew departments were denying him. I would have to deal with it! My husband became employed with the Pender County Sheriffs Office around August of 2007. I worked for the Sheriffs office for about 6 months then Burgaw Police Department offered me a job with more money. I accepted the position. My husband was still working with the Sheriffs Office at that time and I was working at Burgaw Police department full time and Part time at the Sheriffs Office. My husband and I separated shortly after. Things started to get ‚Äúnasty‚Äù between the two of us. He realized I was not coming back and that I was serious about our divorce. A few weeks after, Pender County advised me that I am no longer needed. I was confused. Anytime I was called in because they were short on officers, I was there to take their place. They could always depend on me to come in to work when needed. I did my job, and I did it proudly. Despite the Officer safety issues, despite anything else‚Ä¶.I was always there. I felt my husband had something to do with it, but I left it alone, took what pride I had left and moved on. The stalking, the inappropriate text messages, the phone calls continued. I was in pure hell and sinking fast. I was drained physically, mentally and emotionally. Several instances occurred between the time I left to the time I filed for a Domestic Violence Protective Order. My life was threatened through a 3rd party by my husband, I was choked, pushed, held down, spit on, verbally abused and the list goes on. I documented everything. Anything that occurred, it was on paper. Dates, times, details‚Ä¶.it was all there. My husband came to my house while I was at work, found the documentation and destroyed it. That was the last straw. I filed for a Domestic Violence Protective Order through the Pender County Courts. At the beginning, the clerk tried to talk me out of it and asked me if I realized what it would do to his career. I knew what it would do, but that was not my intention and the last thing on my mind. I wanted to be left alone, I wanted some sort of protection from him so he wasn‚Äôt able to stalk me and send text messages and call. I wanted to feel safe at night and even during the day. The judge signed the order and it was put in place for 10 days until the hearing. It was continued once before it was heard by a judge to finalize the order. I was at peace! The phone calls stopped, the text messages stopped, the random drive by‚Äôs stopped! I was living a normal happy life. The life I deserved. I was served with an Emergency Temporary Custody Order by my husband. Our daughter was 2 year old at the time. 2 years I took care of our daughter, I was there for her at every cry, every laugh. I took care of her, then he just took her away! When our 50B hearing arrived, the custody hearing was also heard the same day, at the same trial, by the same judge. I was asked by the judge why I didn‚Äôt have dates and times on the 50B and I explained to her why. It didn‚Äôt matter. The judges in Pender County made it a big issue because my husband was still working for the Sheriffs Office. No one wanted to hear our case. During the trial, there were testimonies on what I went though, what happened etc. The 50B was dropped and we were granted joint custody. The judge advised me that I was immature to take out the 50B order and that the judge who signed the temporary order must have misunderstood what I wrote in the complaint because there were no dates and times on when the incidents took place. At that point I was speechless. I thought to myself ‚Äúits ok for a man to threaten to kill his wife, to discuss with his friends (to full detail) how he was planning my death and getting away with it, it was ok that he choked me and pushed me in my own house‚Äù. Is this normal? The testimonies were there, the evidence was presented but nothing was put in place. The judge did put a 50C (No Contact) order in place but he knew he wasn‚Äôt able to get criminally charged with a 50C so it was completely ignored! Back to square one! Here came the phone calls, text messages, visits to my house, calls to work etc. Due to the custody order, both of us are court ordered to initiate a phone call to the other parent every other night so our Daughter could talk to the other parent. I went to the extreme of purchasing a prepaid cell phone with no capabilities to text or to leave voicemail and provided my husband with that number and changing my primary phone number so he was unable to text or call me. It worked for a while until he got upset and blocked that number through his phone carrier. I‚Äôm stuck again! He was giving me no choice but to give him my primary phone number so he could text and call anytime he pleases. On February 20th , 2009 I was moving out of my home in Burgaw and moved further away to prevent any other issues with my husband. As I was loading boxes into the moving truck, my husband shows up at my apartment with a gun, yelling and demanding to know where I was moving. He never pointed the weapon at me, but he made sure I knew it was there by taking it out if the small of his back and tucking it in the front waistband of his jeans for all to see. Charging at me he continues to yell and scream at me. My brother and sister heard and saw it all. They stood back and watched. I was frozen, I couldn‚Äôt move. All I could get out of my mouth to say was ‚Äúyour trespassed from here, leave‚Äù‚Ä¶.over and over again I asked him to leave. My sister even took cover behind the moving truck because she didn‚Äôt know what his intentions were. No one knew‚Ä¶.he snapped! I called the police immediately after and they advised me to talk to the Magistrate on duty. After the Police left my husband sent 2 threatening text messages and said he‚Äôs going to end it, it will be the last time I see my daughter etc. After grabbing a couple extra things, we went to the Magistrates office and I filed a criminal complaint. The magistrate issued 4 warrants for his arrest (Assault on a Female, Assault with a Deadly Weapon, Misd. Stalking, and Communicating Threat). We left the magistrates office and shortly after the Magistrate called me back and after reviewing my criminal complaint she thought it would be best if I applied for another Domestic Violence Protective Order. The following Monday, I went to Pender County Court house and applied. I was granted a temporary order for 10 days until our hearing. The hearing was again continued! I went to court on Wednesday March 25th 2009 in reference to my husbands criminal charges. It was taken to trial. I brought the two people that were with me that day, we brought the phone that contained the text messages he sent. I testified to what happened that day and the Assistant District Attorney presented the evidence. Mr. Friend didn‚Äôt deny anything. He admitted having the weapon, he admitted to sending the messages there was no denial in his testimony. His attorney made it clear that Mr. Friend was employed by Pender County Sheriffs Office previously (he was terminated at this point). We had a good case with solid evidence, with dates and times, with no time lapse between the incident, calling the police, and seeing the magistrate. Our evidence met every element for each crime that Mr. Friend admitted to. The charges were dismissed. The judge told me that I was using the Justice System to get back at Mr. Friend by taking out warrants. She also stated that if either one of us had any criminal charges pending that they better be dismissed! I was shocked, confused, upset at what had just occurred. The 50B hearing is on April 20th. I‚Äôm sure Pender County Courts will dismiss this as well despite of the solid testimonies and evidence that will be presented. I‚Äôm at a loss of words. When the threats start again and the harassment and the physical abuse, what am I supposed to do? Who can I turn to? I can‚Äôt call the police, I can‚Äôt go to the magistrate and take proper action to the crime that he has truthfully committed. I can‚Äôt turn to anyone for help and advice, because I‚Äôm immature and spiteful for applying for warrants and a DVPO with a legitimate reason and incident. I was so upset, I told the judge that I would be another N.C. statistic! No one will believe me (except the people who see it) and until I‚Äôm 6 feet under the ground, I will continue to live this dreadful life with no one there to turn to because I have exhausted my options in doing the right thing by going to MY justice system to expect some type of protection! I took great pride and confidence in choosing the profession that I have chosen. To help and protect citizens, to see justice being served. I‚Äôve advised many Domestic Violence women of their rights and I‚Äôve taken off my judgmental blinders to see these women‚Äôs point of view. I am at their level, I‚Äôm a victim of Domestic Violence, but yet Justice is blind and judgmental because we are both Police Officers. Do I not have the same rights citizens do because my husband WAS a police officer? Is he wearing some sort of immune shield against the Justice System? Is he untouchable? I have proven time after time, beyond a reasonable doubt that he has abused me physically, verbally, mentally, emotionally but yet I‚Äôm still at square one. There are still so many things I didn‚Äôt touch on in this letter and I know I did a lot of jumping around, but what is my next step? Where do I go from here? How do I protect my children and myself? ‚ÄúWe owe it to those killed by domestic violence to look for ways to stop these crimes from happening,‚Äù Cooper said. I don‚Äôt want to be another statistic! Can you please respond to my letter and guide me in the right direction. I want protection, not just for me, but for other women that have husbands in respected positions that were denied protection. Thank you in advance, Jasmin M.

A simple analogy:

††††††††††††An economics professor at a local †college stated that he had once†failed an entire class.

††††††††††††That class had insisted that socialism †worked and that no one would be poor
††††††††††††and no one would be rich, a great †equalizer.

††††††††††††The professor then said††"†ok, we †will have an experiment in this class on socialism.†"

††††††††††††All grades would be averaged and everyone would receive the same grade so
††††††††††††no one would fail and no one would receive an A.

††††††††††††After the first test the grades were averaged and everyone got a B.

††††††††††††The students who studied hard were upset and the students who studied
††††††††††††little were happy.

†††††††††††† But, as the second test rolled around, the students who studied little had studied even less
†††††††††††††and the ones†who studied hard †decided they wanted a free ride too; so they studied little.

††††††††††††The second test average was a D!

††††††††††††No one was happy.

††††††††††††When the 3rd test rolled around the average was an F.

†††††††††††† The scores never increased as bickering, blame, name calling all resulted
††††††††††††in hard feelings and no one would study for the benefit of anyone else.

†††††††††††† All failed, to their great surprise, and the professor told them that
††††††††††††socialism would also ultimately fail because when the reward is great,
†††††††††††††the effort to succeed is great; but when government takes all the
††††††††††††reward away; no one will try or want to succeed.

I ask for your support of Senate Bill 6 and House†Bill 26 to reduce the impact of Wind & Hail coverage for my/our homes.
Since this separate policy requirement has been around, I've NEVER been provided any credit for the expense/effort I've expended in trying to further protect my home from storm damage.
My home was built in 1992 and as such, met the building code (hurricane straps) required at that time. †I do not reside in an "oceanfront mansion" but a modest dwelling six blocks off the beach in Kure Beach.
Additionally, I have fully equipped my home with hurricane panels for all windows and doors and, I have emergency roof repair supplies stored in my garage.
I've lived here for more than 10 years and have survived several hurricanes and the only damage I've suffered has been a few shingles which I replaced †myself thus never submitting an insurance claim.
I am certainly distressed that I have to pay such rates for separate wind & hail coverage and that I DO NOT receive any credit for my protective measures. †Additionally, even though my home is built on land that is approx. 24 ft above sea level, I also carry Flood Insurance to preclude any argument re what caused the damage.
I ask that you not only support the efforts to NOT place any more of the burden on those of us who live near the coast and, that you support legislation to create a credit system for mitigation efforts of homeowners.

Dear Gov. Perdue, Sen. Apodaca and Rep. Justus,

Please support the NC SAVE$ ENERGY bill, likely to be introduced
this week, and make North Carolina's homes energy efficient AND
protect our water & climate!

NC SAVE$ ENERGY, an independent (non-utility) energy efficiency
program, will help save money for working families by making
the homes they rent or own more energy efficient and keeping
their power bills from doubling or tripling, creating thousands
of new green jobs in energy efficiency, and reducing North Carolina's
consumption and dependence on dirty, water-hogging, global warming
contributing power plants.  

You can learn more about NC SAVE$ ENERGY at www.ncsavesenergy.org.

Will you join the movement for fairer, more affordable, energy
and water in North Carolina? I look forward to your reply.

Sincerely,
Larry Turk

House Bill 88, the "Healthy Youth Act," will undo more than a decade of progress in which all students in North Carolina's public schools have been taught that abstinence until marriage is the expected standard of behavior. Please vote against or oppose this proposed law which will undermine the sanctity of marriage between one man and one woman and open the door to teaching our kids that "committed relationships" between homosexuals are the equivalent to marriage.

††††††††††††††††††††††† Alcoa case could have long term implications

Governor Perdue has filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to deny the relicensing of Alcoa's hydroelectric plant on the Yadkin River. This case has many implications but points to the growing debate about water, specifically who owns and controls water in our rivers.



Thank you for supporting the County. Alcoa originally was awarded the contract/rights because of the economic (jobs) it would create over at least a hundred others. Now after 50 years to continue to have such rights they should clean up certain concerns and provide ecomonic benefit similar to what other firms would do. They shut down the plant and either should provide employment or share the profits from the water rights (power generation)to continue as many many other firms would. For 50 years they earned their payback. there was a formula for purchasing the plant at end of period which could be agreed to or a sharing arrangiment agreed-upon but just as they can close a plant they don't and never did truly own the water rights. They certainly can't take them with them. Benny Bowers

Governor Beverly Perdue
Office of the Governor
20301 Mail Service Center
Raleigh, NC 27699-0301


Governor Perdue:

Please consider disapproving a higher tax on wine for the following reasons.

In recent years the grapes and wine industry has become more prominent
but it is relatively small and widely scattered around our great state. 
Even the largest winery contracts to only four or five dozen farmers. In
addition there are many other wineries (68 and growing) and many other
associated vineyards.

Also please keep in your thoughts all NC farmers across this great state
who sell fresh muscadine and vineferia grapes to the public.  In a an
economic sense, they are all interrelated and all benefit from the sale of
grapes and grape products.

North Carolina needs to promote grapes and wine for the producer and the
consumer. Inadvertently an alcohol tax will also have an adverse affect on
vineyard farmers particularly in eastern North Carolina.  Critical to this
valuable industry are hardy individuals and families who relentlessly
produce a crop despite freezing spring weather, prolonged drought,insect
pests and diseases, and crushing economic times. Without their collective
success, support for further opportunities such as resveratrol and the
health aspects of grapes will "wither on the vine".

Please discourage legislation which adversely impacts the entire grape and
wine industry in this hard economic times.  And thank you for your
consideration on this tax increase and for your continued support for
farms, jobs and the grape industry in North Carolina.

Regards,

Ken

Dear Governor Perdue:



I hope you took a few minutes to enjoy the peace and quiet, that is easily unrecognized, in the area†you visited and broke ground upon.† If the Camden Outlying Landing Field (OLF) is placed nearby,†you would not have been able to think about anything but the screamingly loud jet noise that would have scared the bejesus out of all of us, and ruined what might have been a great day!



Thank you for helping to eliminate a traffic bottleneck, but without further assistance, by†connecting Belcross to Barco with a†four lane road, the bottleneck is simply†"moved down the†road aways".†



But any help is good help.† I hope this increase in infrastructure is not†wasted as†maybe someone will be around to use the new road.† That's if the†recently reported 82nd fastest growing county†IN THE COUNTRY, (Currituck County, and last year 78th fastest growing),†does not quit growing due to the nuisance that will be the OLF.††



Again, thank you, and please continue to help those of us that have chosen to live in NENC.† As a life long resident of Currituck, I realize change is a necessity, but smart change is the wise choice.



Also, thank you for continuing to help "Keep NENC OLF Free".†

Governor Perdue,

I am writing to express my disapproval of SESSION LAW 2007-147 HOUSE BILL 1340 which has given the idea to amateur radio operators that it is OK to disregard other property owners while pursuing their hobby. The FCC did not reconsider the limited preemption policy of PRB-1 (1985) in 1999, 2000 (partial), and 2001.

To subscribe to the idea that HAMs provide emergency communication in the Information Age is an embarrassment. Last count showed 1.9 million cellular towers already in operation in the USA. Communication via satellite is much more accessible to the general population compared to a HAM radio.

I was raised and live in Greensboro. After serving the US military in CA, TX, and eastern NC, I returned to Greensboro because I knew first hand what a great place Greensboro is to live and raise a family. I am a mechanical design engineer working in aviation.

My wife and I put a lot of work and money into an older house in the Garden Homes neighborhood of Greensboro. We sold that house in order to buy a larger house that would accommodate our child. That was three years ago.

Two and a half years ago, the property that shares the rear boundary of my back yard was purchased by an amateur radio operator. Thanksgiving 2007, we returned home from a long weekend to find the radio antenna, shown in the attachment, erected just a few feet from our property. I do not consider this to be "...a reasonable accommodation to amateur radio antennas..." nor do other people in my neighborhood.

The Greensboro city ordinance enforcement department is unwilling to interpret the ordinance favorably for me and my offended neighbors. I believe this is due to the perception that amateur radio hobbyist have been given immunity to civil consequence by SL 2007-147 / HB1340.

So far my efforts to relieve my property of the matter have cost me >100 hours of my time and >$700. This situation has the potential to consume a lot more time, money, and energy that might otherwise be put to good use.

I wanted you to be aware of the consequences (which the FCC recognized) bystanders endure when this kind of legislation is passed.

Regards,

John Steelman

I have read that some in our house of Repís want to take away the 5 year license time and cutie to 3 years simply because we are over 75 years of age. Does that make us bad risks, simply because we passed a set time that some think we are a menace on the roads?

I personally have been driving for 60 years without a ticket, and with just1 accident. How many teenagers can say they have gone several years without a ticket?

I donít know who started this thing, but I donít think it was any of the Democrats in the house. I think the other party is trying to make a name for it self.

Ask them to ask me what name I would suggest. Itís unprintable.

Please donít let this thing go through. There are many of us AARP who are against it, and we pack quite a wallop in the voting box.

Dear Govenor,
†† Your decision to freeze travel, raises, promotions is the correct one.††We all must tighten our belts until we work through the economics situation we are in. The company I work for there are no management raises this year at store level and at the coprortae level. Even when we, as a state,†have an above revenue collection† year we do not need to put any programs in place for †more than a year or longer than the allocated funds will support it as we have done in the past few years.

A couple of suggestions that I would have that may be in place but may not† be enforced are:
†State Builidngs have their temperatures set at a state set degree level, each office should empty their own trash or take it to a centeral location so that if we are paying a janitorial service their daily rates can be reduced. or perhaps we only need the service 3 times a week and not 5 days a week.Their may be other area that can be looked at in state buildings†such as†outside sign burning at night,†the watage of light bulbs, what times lights are turned on and off or left on all night long. Are the calcualtors of the desk turned off at night as well as computers, monitors, ,and†printers etc.

Do we have to many associates doing some of the jobs. I am sure you have heard the stories where on some state jobs as well as on our contract jobs on the roads where some times there are 2 men, one at each end of the constuction area with walkie talkies, that both have signs that have stop on one side and go on one side. The 2 men talk to each other to allow traffic to flow one way when a lane of a road has to be closed. This makes sense to me but then you also have a times when we have a the same 2 men and† a truck that saids follow me on the back. The 2† signmen do the same thing but we also have a man driving the truck leading cars† all day long back and forth from one end of the construction to the other end back and forth. HUM sound likes a waste of resources .
I know you have seen or heard that we have to many people on road projects at times.
I will not go there† because it would take to long to write how many peoople we have their and what† they are or not doing.

We need to work through nutrition or offer some folks partime positions if need to balance the work load outs in area that need to be balanced.
Back in SC, at Lander University, their have been pay CUTS is that possible here in N.C.
It was not popular but a lot of folks still have a job where others may not have had a job.

Could we increase the †tax, yes TAX every can or bottle of† beer. liquor, wine ,softdrinks,Gator Aid etc by 1 cents a bottle or can. The tax would be collected by the manufactured or distributor at time of sale to the merchant. The merchant could pass the cost along or obsorbed the cost increase.

Do we need all the student programs at our Universities and are they self funded?

How about the money raised through our Universities through their sports events?
How is this accounted for and where does the excess go.
I also suggest that if a state school awards a scholarship to an athletic that he or she has to stay the 4 years or pay it back. It is a contract between the state and them. After all the athletic is improved throught the coaches whom we pay handsomley†as well as are †exposed by our use of our state sports programs. If they go pro or leave then we should be repaid the value of the education they have used. If pro then their should be a finincial penalty imposed on them.

Perhaps you could have each newspaper run in them as well as on the radio a public service announcement to send to your email address ways that the citizens on NC think we as a state can save money.

In a lot of retail companies there is a salary scale in which a job pays from low to high. Once you reach the highest level you do not make any more regardless of the number of years of service.
Why do we have to change tag colors, designs so often?
Can we keep some of our state vechilce longer and use them and not sale them off as often or is there a mileage or age limit on these state vechicle?

I am sure there are other ways out their to save money but these are just a few I though off as i saw on the news tonight you had frozen some areas of the state expenses.


Regards,
JOHN

Dear Rep. Justus,

An important new NC House bill, H1442, has been filed in the
NC General Assembly, to give millions of NC well-users the same
rights to information to protect their water that public water
system customers have!  

This bill will affect thousands of well users in EVERY legislative
district, even the most urban ones. Republican or Democrat, everyone
cares about their drinking water. But users of wells installed
before July, 2008 currently have NO PROTECTION or ìRIGHT TO KNOWî!

This bill is sponsored by Reps Pricey Harrison of Greensboro,
Carolyn Justice of Hampstead, Dan Blue of Raleigh, and Rick Glazier
of Fayetteville, would:

    * Require notification to private well users of nearby known
contamination
    * Offer residents assistance with testing wells for suspected
contaminants
    * Require testing of well water BEFORE a real estate transfer,
or every 3 years for rental properties
    * Create a publicly accessible, comprehensive Groundwater
Quality Database
    * Provide $250,000 a year to cover expenses of notification
and testing, including grants up to $20,000 to county well programs
for those tasks.

We should have done this long ago.

Sincerely,
Larry Turk

Sixty-eight percent (68%) of U.S. voters favor strict government sanctions on employers who hire illegal immigrants, according to a new Rasmussen Reports national <http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/68_say_those_who_employ_illegal_immigrants_should_be_punished##>telephone survey. Thatís up slightly from a <http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/immigration/immigration_matters_60_favor_sanctions_for_illegal_hires>couple of years ago.

Only 22% say the employers should not be penalized, and 10% are not sure.

Voters are more divided on whether to punish landlords who rent or sell property to illegal immigrants--48% support sanctions on landlords while 36% are opposed.

<http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics2/73_say_cops_should_check_immigration_status_during_traffic_stops>Polling released yesterday showed strong support for having police officers check the immigration status of those pulled over for a traffic violation. But most voters are at least somewhat concerned that efforts to identify and deport <http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/68_say_those_who_employ_illegal_immigrants_should_be_punished##>illegal immigrants also will end up violating the civil rights of some U.S. citizens.

On the employment front, Congress last week did not reauthorize the federal E-Verify program which allows employers to check on the immigration status of prospective employees. Use of E-Verify has been voluntary because efforts by <http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/68_say_those_who_employ_illegal_immigrants_should_be_punished##>the Bush Administration to make it mandatory have been opposed in court by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Associated Builders and Contractors and others.

The Obama administration wants to review the program before deciding whether to endorse it.

Seventy-seven percent (77%) of Republicans support strict sanctions on employers who hire illegal immigrants, as do 58% of Democrats and 72% of those not affiliated with either major party.

Seventy-six percent (76%) of white voters think strict sanctions should be imposed on employers who hire illegals, but African-Americans are evenly divided.

When it comes to landlord sanctions, 62% of GOP voters favor them, while nearly half of Democrats (48%) are opposed.

Among unaffiliated voters, 49% favor landlord sanctions, while 29% are opposed.

<http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/issues2/articles/74_say_government_not_doing_enough_to_secure_borders>Most voters (74%) say the federal government is not doing enough to secure the nationís borders.

Governor Perdue:

As a fitness professional, small business operator, and member of the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association (IHRSA), I would like to ask you to oppose House Bill 1219. By outlawing continuation of services provisions, this legislation places costly and unwarranted laws on small businesses that are working to make the people of North Carolina healthier.

85% of IHRSA health clubs nationwide offer a month-to-month agreement and report that of all the agreements the clubs offer, the month to month membership is the most popular (being utilized by 49% of club members), according to industry research.

Allowing for continuation of services provisions leads to the greatest consumer choice and flexibility for the 22% of North Carolina residents that belong to health clubs because it does not force health clubs to sell long term contracts in order to avoid the costly process of renewing existing members. 
In requiring that the bill become effective immediately following enactment, HB 1219 would obligate health clubs to tear up every membership contract they have entered into and force each of their many members to come in and enter into a new agreement all at once. Based on industry research, this would mean that average health club in North Carolina would need to enter into new contracts with more than 1,650 consumers. The administrative burden and associated costs of this would be extreme.

The cost of perpetual renewal would require a large expenditure of staff time and ultimately result in higher costs for the consumer. During these tough economic times, the state of North Carolina should be encouraging people to lead healthy lives, not making it more difficult to afford the very services that help them.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Lisa LaGanke

Dear Governor Perdue,
†
We urge that you support NC Racial Justice in North Carolina's, 
concerning the death penalty, which has been disproportionately applied 
to persons of color and low economic status.† Race is one of the most 
significant factors related to a defendant's likelihood of being 
sentenced to die vs. life in prison without parole. Persons of color 
are often excluded by prosecutors from Capital juries and many of the 
African-Americans on NC's Death Row were sentenced by all white juries.
†
NC Racial Justice Act Bills seek to address these racial disparities in 
NC's capital punishment system.†† Under the RJA, a defendant would be 
allowed to present factual evidence to support his or her claim that a 
sentence of death was improperly obtained on the basis of race.† If a 
defendant is successful in establishing this claim, a court could 
impose a sentence of life without parole instead of death.
†
Race should never be a factor in N. C. law,  especially regarding death 
sentences. We urge that  you support Racial Justice in North 
Carolina.††
†

Lewis and Jeannette Patrie

Governor Perdue:

As a fitness professional, small business operator, for over 10 years and member of the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association (IHRSA), I would like to ask you to oppose House Bill 1219. By outlawing continuation of services provisions, this legislation places costly and unwarranted laws on small businesses that are working to make the people of North Carolina healthier. 

We opened Cape Carteret Aquatic & Wellness Center with the consumer in mind; we offered month-to-month agreements 10 years ago, when industry standards recommended annual contracts. We still offer the month-to-month agreement with the option of cancellation at any time. Being a strong advocate for a healthy lifestyle, we feel strongly that long term contracts hurt the consumer.

85% of IHRSA health clubs nationwide offer a month-to-month agreement and report that of all the agreements the clubs offer, the month to month membership is the most popular (being utilized by 49% of club members), according to industry research. 

Allowing for continuation of services provisions leads to the greatest consumer choice and flexibility for the 22% of North Carolina residents that belong to health clubs because it does not force health clubs to sell long term contracts in order to avoid the costly process of renewing existing members. One of the first questions potential members ask is "Do I have to sign a contract?". Having the ability to have the auto renew on the month-to-month agreement eliminates the need for signing long term contracts. In my opinion, long term contracts only benefit the business owner, not the consumer. I propose that instead of trying to stop auto renew contracts, in would better serve the consumer to stop the long term agreement (12-24 months)

In requiring that the bill become effective immediately following enactment, HB 1219 would obligate health clubs to tear up every membership contract they have entered into and force each of their many members to come in and enter into a new agreement all at once.  This would force my business to destroy current inventory we use for membership applications, change all brochures, contact,  and inform all members, forcing me to hire additional staff to do nothing but paper work, when they should be working with North Citizens to help them become healthier. My current staff works directly with the club members, we have no sales staff, because we educate, instruct and assist our members. Based on industry research, this would mean that average health club in North Carolina would need to enter 
into new contracts with more than 1,650 consumers. The administrative burden and associated costs of this would be extreme.

The cost of perpetual renewal would require a large expenditure of staff time and ultimately result in higher costs for the consumer. During these tough economic times, the state of North Carolina should be encouraging people to lead healthy lives, not making it more difficult to afford the very services that help them. Our average monthly rate of $51.30 per month would need to be increase to cover the additional financial burden that would be place on us. My members could not absorb as 20% increase in their dues, they would cancel their membership. How does this benefit North Carolinas?

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Deanna McElmon
