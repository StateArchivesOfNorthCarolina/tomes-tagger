Subject: Figure Eight Island

Comment: My name is Alexis Reynolds and I am a student at North Carolina State University. I wanted to write to you and find out about your stance on the rapidly degrading North Carolina coastline in areas such as Figure Eight Island and Wrightsville Beach. Currently, with the state laws prohibiting hardened structures on beaches and inlets, many people are wondering if everything is being done to save our beautiful coastlines and peoples homes. There are many people that believe hardened structures such as jetties and groins built on the coastline will interrupt the natural sand bypass system, and cause negative impacts to islands nearby. There is also concern that these structures will increase erosion further down the beach and destroy the natural beauty of our coastline. The other side of the argument is in protecting the coastline by not allowing the erosion to continue. Millions of dollars in property damage will accumulate as the sand continues to erode. I was wondering what your stance on the issue was, and if there was any current or future legislature in place that would solve this environmental problem! Thank you, Alexis Reynolds

Subject: My Son

Comment: Mr & Mrs. Usategui 2109 John McMillan Road Hope Mills N.C. 28348 Dear Mrs Bev Perdue September 18, 2009 My name is Carolyn Usategui and I am writing in behalf of my son, Nathan Usategui. When my son was seventeen years old he made a very bad mistake in his life and was arrested for breaking and entering. His judge in court was Judge Lynn Johnson in Cumberland County. Nathan also volunteered for Sgt. Redds program. Completing the program as Distinguished Honor Graduate, September 19 2008 Nathan was told to write a letter to the governor and have character reference letters wrote for him. Included was a letter from Judge Johnson and Sgt. Redd. All paperwork was to be taken to Raleigh by Sgt. Redd and given to the Governor to try to get Nathan‚Äôs record erased. Nathan would like to join the military and be a Fire Fighter. Nathan is now twenty years old and took a leave of absents from his job at Brock Cabinets to go to Firefighter school fulltime. He will complete this school in mid November. He is making good grades and has not been into any trouble since then. Nathan would like to make something out of his life. My problem is everything that Nathan and us were told never happened. He did everything asked of him and more. Nathan was dismissed from probation early, all money was paid that was owed early, volunteered into Sgt. Redd‚Äôs program and came out #1 and completed all letters asked of him, from himself to military families. Everything was given to Sgt. Redd and he said he hand delivered them to Raleigh. Now it has been almost a year, and we have not heard anything. I have contacted Judge Johnson‚Äôs office to see if we could make an appointment with him about this matter and was told he does not see anyone. We have called Sgt. Redd and were told it takes time. It has been a long time It seems like it has been forgotten. When a young adult makes a mistake in their life, it should not be the end of their life or career. When you are promised help from your judge and the Cumberland County Probation Physical Training Program, you would expect just that. I do not understand why you would promise these young adults something you do not deliver. This to me does not seem to be very good role models for these kids. Also, who are they suppose to believe. You would think the judge of all people. I am attaching my son‚Äôs letter and his father‚Äôs letter that was given to Sgt. Redd to be hand delivered. I hope you will find the time to read both letters and guide us where to go for help so my son can pursue his career. He has grown to a fine young man. Thank you for your time. Also you may contact me by e-mail at usategui@embarqmail.com Thank you, Mrs. Usategui Nathan Alexander Usategui 2109 John McMillan Road Hope Mills N.C. 28348 October 23, 2008 To whom it may concern, My name is Nathan Usategui. I am nineteen years old and graduated from Grays Creek High School in 2007.I decided I wanted to join the United States Navy so I made a commitment to myself in 2004 to join the N.J.R.O.T.C. and keep with it thru out high school. I wanted to be in the military. After three years of N.J.R.O.T.C. I finally pushed the button and became part of the D.E.P. for the United States Navy. I had taken my asvab and physical and was schedule to leave on July 7 2007 to Chicago, Illinois for basic training. Instead, I did a stupid thing and stole two dirt bikes from someone and got caught. What a wake-up call that was. My career just pasted before me. At this point of my life I am now a felon. Now, this is who I am two years later. I have been employed at Brocks Cabinets located in Fayetteville, N.C. full-time and not missed even a day. I became employee of the month before the first year even rolled around. Everyone there likes me, and I get along well with everyone there. I enrolled on my own in Sgt. Red‚Äôs Boot Camp program, loved it, and graduated #1 Distinguished Honor Graduate. So now I am struggling forward with this letter and my now good citizenship hoping for some help. I believe I am a good and productive citizen at this point. I have owned up to my mistake, paid the price and would like to move forward with my career. I am looking to pursue the United States Army now. I would like to go through jump school, ranger school and whatever other interest come my way. I am not a bad person; I just made a bad choice when I was younger. I now hope you can find it in your heart to be able to help me pursue my life and career. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Nathan Alexander Usategui Mr & Mrs. Usategui 2109 John McMillan Road Hope Mills, N.C. 28348 910-424-5962 November 12 2008 To whom it may concern, My name is Carlos Usategui and I am 46 years old. I served eight years in the military, got out an E5 on honorable discharge to own and operate my automotive shop. I did this for fifteen years and decided two years ago I wanted to try something different so I started installing cabinets for Brocks Cabinets. I also enlisted in the Navy Reserves two years ago and fixing to reenlist for six more years. I am writing this letter in reference to my son, Nathan Usategui. Nathan has never given his mother or I any trouble before. He was always active in sports such as baseball, football and wrestling. He made good grades in school. He joined JROTC the last three years of high school, loved it and decided that is what he wanted to do when he graduated. He talked to his mother and I about joining the military and we supported him in his decision all the way. Then in 2006, right before Nathan graduated he got himself into some trouble. Trouble that he now realizes has cost him his career. The career he has wanted for three years, the military. Trouble that his mother and I could not believe. But after many discussions, his mother and I decided the best thing we could do was to make Nathan pay for what he had done. As you can image, this was very hard for a parent to do. But we did it and Nathan stepped up to the plate and did what he had to do. Nathan did his community service every weekend until he completed his hours; he has stayed ahead on his payments to his probation officer, which he pays out of his paycheck from his job, did six months of intense probation, which he never violated, and volunteered into Sgt. Redds program and finished being number one distinguished honor graduate. Now, here I am writing you for some help for my son. Nathan has proven to me he has become a great young man. He works full-time at Brocks Cabinets and has never missed a day. He pays his bills and contributes towards the household when needed. Nathan helps his mother and I around the house and yard when there are things that need to be done. I know my son made a very bad judgment in his young life but I do believe he has stepped up and taken responsibility for what he has done and has moved forward. I can‚Äôt believe the way he has grown up, and the fine person he has become. As a father, I can honestly say he is quite a young man and has proven to me what a man he can be. We are very proud to say Nathan Usategui is our son. I hope you can find it in your heart to help him pursue his life and career and understand that he made a mistake in his young life. Nathan is not a bad person, he made a bad decision. I feel Nathan deserves a second chance and not have to pay the rest of his life for a decision he made as a young adult. Thank you for everything. Sincerely Carlos Usategui

Subject: Tax on Meal Plan

Comment: Governor Perdue, First of all, I‚Äôd like to say that I am very grateful to be employed by the great State of North Carolina. As a new employee of North Carolina, I am glad I have had an opportunity to be a part of this progressive state. However, as a recent college graduate and minimum wage employee, it can be very difficult to live during these economic times. In August of this year, I joined the Western Carolina University Athletic department as a Media Relations Assistant (Intern). My wage of 7.25 per hour, 40 hours a week is barely sustainable during this day and age. However, as an added bonus, I was given a campus meal plan that would allow me to save money and help me pay my bills (rent, student loans and other bills). I was disappointed to find out that last week(Sept. 15) when I received my check, that I only obtained $377 dollars of an expected check of $739 (after federal and state income taxes were taken out). When I asked why I had received less money, I was told that my meal plan was taxable. Therefore, I had to pay all the taxes out of my first check. This was very disheartening and concerning. To begin with, I was never told I had to pay taxes on meal plans. Like a majority of states (Mississippi, etc), meal plans are tax free. I am not saying a person should avoid paying taxes. It‚Äôs good to help fund our state any way we can. However, when an income like mine, very low, it‚Äôs difficult to pay these taxes, especially all up front. In the end, by October, I will be 400 dollars in the hole, because I can‚Äôt afford to pay my rent, credit card bill, student loans and so forth. I am asking you to please, please change the legislation that requires to pay taxes on meal plans. Since my earned wages and meal plan were combined for a total of $2,100, it took away nearly $500 dollars from my pocket. Not to mention that a meal plan is very limited, I can‚Äôt spend it on bills, clothing, or entertainment. Therefore, in my opinion, it‚Äôs not cash. I understand the taxes on gifts, etc, but this was a necessity to attract me to work for North Carolina. If I would have known this item was taxable, I probably would have never accepted the position here. This is a great way to discourage younger, enthusiastic prospects for working for this great state. There needs to be a change in this law. Please, make meal plans tax free or at least tax free for those who are on a limited income, like myself. Not to mention, since I have no health benefits, I can‚Äôt even afford a short-term medical plan. I love to work here in North Carolina and would like to continue to do so, but it‚Äôs going to be very taxing on me and my family. Again, I appreciate your time working for the citizens of North Carolina and I hope I may speak with you soon. Sincerely, Russell D. Luna Media Relations Assistant (Intern) Western Carolina University Cullowhee, N.C. (615)308-6245 ‚Äì cell

Subject: ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR N.C. BUSINESSES

Comment: I own an SBE, certified with NCDOT, that installs signs. Recently we bid as a sub to do work on an upcoming project. The job was awarded to the general contractor who used our numbers for the sign installation portion of work. We were the apparent low bidder and the GC was going to award us the work. HOWEVER, when the GC got THEIR award letter, the State of NC had taken MY Company's $11,600. in sign installation out of the contract and GAVE the money to the NCDOT Division so their personnel could install the signs. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN? You're not growing small businesses, you're using federal money to supplement the State of NC's budget short-fall!!!! I don't expect you'll answer this, because you can't explain it away. Tell the Economic Development Panel (that Gov Perdue has instructed to find ways to grow business) why this is happening and see if this is a good way to grow businesses in N.C. So where do you stand Gov Perdue? growing business or balancing the budget on the backs of small business? -Sincerely, One Dissappointed Democrat

Governor† Purdue, attached is a copy of the letter my daughter is sending in for an appeal.††This †is an example of what I was talking to you about when I emailed you back earlier this year.† I know that my daughter has done an excellent job with the Charlotte/Mecklenburg School System.† We hear complaints all the time about incapable teachers and people working in the school system, then why, will you explain to me that this individual lost her job for doing a good job.† She should have never lost her job and she should have already been hired back.† First of all,†no one should come to you while you are in the middle of working and have you sign something without a discussion as to whether it is true or not.† I think this was done on purpose at a time when she could not defend herself.† I know what it is like to be put on the spot and not have the opportunity to defend yourself.†

You know I believe everyone has the right to appeal what appears to be something gone bad.† I have friends who have been teachers and retired from doing just that.† They were dedicated individuals who believed in teaching and helping every child to learn.† Now, I do blieve that I have just such an individual here, not just because she is my daughter but because she is dedicated to helping and it is ashame that she has been given a rotten apple out of no fault of her own.† This appears to me that she lost her job so someone else could be hire, could that be because of who you know in today's world.† It is just plain down right not right.......

I would appreciate your help in looking into this matter for us.

Subject: Letter of Appeal

Board of Education,


I am responding to a letter I received from Peter Gorman,superintendent of Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools dated September 24,2009, which stated I was entitled to request a hearing before the Board of Education.†

I worked for CMS from 8/2000 until 6/2009 as a K-3 assistant at Shamrock Gardens Elementary.† During my employment my evaluations were always meets or exceeds expectations.† In the nine years I was with CMS my dedication surpassed the job description of an assistant.† While I was at Shamrock I was PTA president, worked many extra hours helping fellow teachers to ensure the success in the classroom, covered the Computer Lab for entire year, and utilized as a†K-5 Literacy teacher with me doing my own plans and teaching small groups.†† Many of my students came to group with frowns not wanting to read but before long they couldn't wait until our group time and would arrive with big smiles.† Last year my first graders went from reading eight words a minute to fifty-nine to sixty words per minute.† Also, due to my high expectations not only for my students but also for myself, my students helped Shamrock Gardens make the necessary growth needed to come off the state lists.

My education includes an AA from CPCC and I am currently a junior at UNC-Charlotte in the Elementary Education.† I was inducted into KDP(Kappa Delta Pi) in education.† Community service includes Habitat for Humanity, buying school uniforms and working with many families/students to build self confidence and self esteem.

I was dismissed not based on my true job performance but based on an evaluation that was subjective and†on popularity.† Mr. Wilson, the principal†filled out my evaluation without ever observing me.† The evaluation was brought to me during my afternoon reading group, was instructed needed to sign right then because he had to have downtown that afternoon.† I didn't agree with everything in evaluation but was also instructed that he doesn't give all three's and that it was a good evaluation.† Due to the fact that I have never had a bad evaluation, I signed and felt that my job security was safe.† However, this was not the case and my job security came down to that one evaluation. It was my understanding that the new evaluation form was so supposed to get rid of employees not doing their job and keep those that are but that doesn't appear to be the case especially†at Shamrock.† I lost my job to individuals that belittle children†and†are†not in trusted to teach children due to their own inabilities.

I would appreciate the opportunity to have a hearing before the board at which time I can produce the necessary documentation that supports my qualifications and if necessary individuals that can speak on my behalf.† It is also important to note that since my dismissal from CMS I have applied for numerous jobs ranging from assistant to budget assistant and haven't had any success.† I can't understand how an employee who gave so much to CMS hasn't been given a true opportunity to return to a career that I love so much.

Again, I look forward to hearing from you with a time and date that we can meet to discuss my†job reinstatement.† I can be reached at 704-819-5481 should you have any further questions or concerns.


Sincerely,

Christina L. Newton

I am Mr. Dwayne Keith Mobley and today I am writing to you this letter, due to the very sensitive nature of what we as the people of this country, hold dear. We have long fought for our Rights, as is our history, and me standing up for my own, should not be of any surprise. As when the English, felt when the, Colonialist of our country of old, could not at all make it without them, so does the display of those who my many complaints are about. That my overall freedoms are being challenged by forces that are not at all fully recognizable to me, it is for these reasons that my many letters of complaint have come to you. But sadly all I have seen is the overwhelming force take you as well, so what do you think it has done to me, especially if you are of many who act upon crimes of injustice. You have left me alone and have turned a deaf ear to my cry to you for help. I am the first to be aware of the force that can come upon, what I ask of you and it is for that reason, I have asked, because of the magnitude and the many people who feel that our law is of no threat to them who do the things that I have written to you over the years. I see things occurring all the time, as the countries offices of the Attorney General, act upon crime in ways that would scare the pants off of anyone who dared them and believe me these people are, literally daring you. The come as authority, of which, either have family that inform to them of me that may work within your offices or the offices of, elsewhere. But for me I am represented by no one that I know. But I would like to ask of you to send to me any letters that deny me your help, by U.S. mail and for you to know that I ask this of you, knowing that I have U.S. Mail theft and fraud, but the U.S. Postal Inspections Services have countless letters of complaint concerning these acts of theft and fraud, so if anyone comes to you, you should start your investigation, looking into how and why, they know who sent to me what and when!

Subject: Progress Energy

Comment: I am writing to see if you can steer me to the right person or can help in any way. This is a serious situation. Anything you can do would be greatly appreciated. There are so many other people like me today in NC dealing with Progress Energy that just can't get help. I was moving and set up a new account and number with Progress Energy. Never been a customer of this company before. They told me to pay a deposit which I quickly did. The day of my move I got a call that said the service was on and everything was fine. When I go to the house there was no meter or service. I called and was told my money had been put towards someone else's bill. Right then I contacted the Utilities Commision. The story they gave me had changed within an hour to another excuse. They keep requesting more and more personal documents. I finally got worried about privacy concerns and asked to have questions answered about where my info was going and who was seeing it. When I did, they cut off all mediation through the Commission. What is going on? What should I do? I don't want to move because it will be an expensive ordeal but I can't stay like this.

Dear Governor Perdue:

Ocracoke School was honored to have you visit with us. Your presence brought government to a very personal level for our students. I am sure they will remember when the Governor of North Carolina spent time talking and interacting with them in their classrooms and throughout the school.

Following your tour of our school you recognized that we have two major facilities needs, a regulation size gymnasium with bleachers and appropriately safe space between the court and the seating and a cafeteria with a kitchen.

Our Capital Improvements Committee is working with the architect, Mr. Ben Cahoon, to finalize plans for the construction of a new gym using part of our existing gym. Unfortunately, there are insufficient funds to provide our students with a cafeteria and kitchen.

The Capital Improvements Committee and Mr. Cahoon agreed that we need to create a design plan with a footprint for a cafeteria and kitchen in the event additional funds become available.† According to Mr. Cahoon, the cost for the addition of a cafeteria and kitchen will be approximately $458,500.

As you recognized, Ocracoke School may be the only school in North Carolina that does not have a cafeteria and kitchen.†

We appreciate whatever you can do to support us in our efforts to provide our students with healthy breakfasts and lunches.

I have included a summary of Mr. Cahoon's estimate below:

It is a Cultural Resources project, with NCDOT helping fund with stimulus money. This may be something for the Recovery office, as there is a percentage of recovery money that must go to enhancement projects such as this, and not for regular roads, bridges, etc.

Comment: I absolutely cannot believe that the DOT gave a grant of $250.000 for the African-American Music Trail! How in the heck is that at all related to DOT's agenda and why is that money being throwed away on a frivolous pursuit when North Carolina has so many people suffering for money to buy food for the table and utilities for their home? I think this is a travesty!

Subject: All NC Workers Deserves Smoke-free Protection

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: A new Institute of Medicine report confirms that smoke-free policies save lives. The report, released yesterday, verifies that secondhand smoke from cigarettes can cause acute coronary events such as heart attack and chest pain. This report follows an earlier study documenting that heart attack rates dropped 17 percent one year after implementation of smoke-free laws and continued to decline over time, with about a 36 percent drop three years after enacting the restrictions. Thanks to passage of HB2, North Carolinians can expect similar health benefits when our smoke-free policy is implemented in January. Studies like these demonstrate that smoke-free polices improve public health in many ways. In addition to protecting people from lung cancer and other respiratory illnesses, smoke-free laws also help reduce cardiovascular disease, which is the leading killer in North Carolina and the nation. We know having smoke-free restaurants and bars in North Carolina will prevent heart attacks and save lives. Extending our smoke-free policy to cover all workers would save even more lives. As your constituent, I invite you to read the new IOM report at www.iom.edu and consider the benefits of allowing all North Carolina workers to be protected by our smoke-free law. Thank you for your efforts to improve public health in North Carolina. Sincerely, Gregg Stave 101 Stoneridge Pl Chapel Hill, NC 27514-9775

Subject: Medical Services in North Carolina

Comment: Ms. Bev Perdue North Carolina Governor I just got laid off of my job as a professional. My wife used the services of Carolinas HealthCare System while I was still employed. I still have a bill of $530. I called to make a payment plan, not more than $20 or perhaps $25 per month. The response from the system is no matter how much you own, you only have 12 months to pay you debt in equal amounts (in my case about $45 minimum). That means if a citizen owns for instance $5,000 (that is nothing for medical care) he must pay not less than $400 per month or his/her account goes into collection, regardless of his/her condition of financial status (period). My question is, what is the medical system or health system for North Carolina citizens?? I came from Florida about 3.5 years ago, and if you have a bill with a hospital supported by the state over there they make arrangements for payments according to your financial condition. Here, these folks want to destroy a very valuable asset for any American family, your credit, like that is nothing. And they are using something where any American family is the most fragile, and vulnerable, their health!! No one is saying ‚ÄúGive it for free, or I don‚Äôt want to pay‚Äù, the person is just saying we are going through a very difficult financial situation, which I didn‚Äôt create, give me a chance to recover and get back on my feet. Governor with all due respect, something should be done for the average Joe. Thanks, Danny Marmolejos

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, Thank you for the job you do everyday for the citizens of NC. We just wanted to make you aware of our start up company in Kernersville, NC. Please visit our website: www.MissJennysPickles.com when you can. Below you will find more about us: ~Modern Day Pickle with an Old Fashioned Taste! Located in Kernersville,NC, we produce our three brands of pickles: Hot, Bread and Butter and our signature pickle, Salt&Pepper.  Our backgrounds are as unique as our Salt&Pepper pickles.  Ashlee is the city girl and Jenny is the country girl.  Our partnership has been in place for years but it wasn't until June 2009 that we knew we wanted to start a business together.  Over the past few months we have learned more about the cucumber industry than is humanly possible.  We have been to Dunn, Faison, and Mt.Olive, NC to learn all we can about the cucumber business. We have thoroughly enjoyed the interesting people we have met along the way and have come to realize our true calling as "The Pickle Girls". Given our financial backgrounds we felt like we had a head start in forming a company that so far has been rewarding, educational, and just plain fun! Thus, Miss Jenny's Pickles was born. One of our favorite mottos is that "Mt Olive started during the Great Depression and Miss Jenny's TM started in the Great Recession. We are even getting ready to attend pickle school to learn more about pickles! Our passion is to create a healthy alternative product for everyone to enjoy. Thank you in advance for helping us make Miss Jenny's Pickles a household name! All our best, Jenny and Ashlee We will be at the Lexington BBQ festival on 10/24 and if you are there we would love for you to stop by our tent. If you are unable to attend then we would love to send samples to you please let us know if that is okay. Take care & we look forward to hearing from you.

Subject: Day Care is a Danger

Comment: I am a resident of Durham county and have resided at 408 Pearson Drive for the past four years. There has been some crime on my street whereby people have had property stolen from their vehicles while parked on their private driveways. There has also been a lot of garbage thrown on the street by people who speed through this street via Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway disposing of their trash from the fast food establishments nearby. My number one concern however is that a nearby Day Care that has been operating on this street for more than one year had been raided by the police just this past April. When it was raided there were arms and narcotics found on the premises while children were also present. Now I see the same Day Care operating again. I am concerned that this is an unregulated Day Care and do not see why they should be allowed to be back on operation. I am asking that this Day Care located at 342 Pearson Drive, be removed from our block as I worry that they will invite more of the same as before and perhaps already have. Please, investigate this Day Care regarding it's operability. Sincerely, Barbara Mezo

Subject: No Child Left Behind - ADHD

Comment: My child attends Salemburg Elementary in Salemburg, NC. I have been constantly contacting the counselor, speech therapist, and had extensive meetings with my child's Teachers to help her make it thru the 5th grade. She has been diagnosed w/ ADHA by a psychologist and Doctor with extensive testing done by each every two years; This started when she was 7. She used to be allowed 504 Testing in her classroom, but now there are NO Teacher's Aides due to funding. ADHD is a disability in NC Education Book and each school is required to assist disabled students. My child is being left behind!!!!! The school work is so overwhelming and her reading, vocab, science and math scores basically average D to F. This is completely outrageous and I need someone to help all of these children that are not going to make it past the grade their in at present due to the lack of consideration and funds for the students that need it the most. I am begging for some sort of advice, assistance, anything at all. If she does not pass the 5th grade due to the EOG and daily grade requirements, then she will feel worse inside than she already does and that is the first sign of giving up and quitting school at an early age because there in no one to stand behind her/them. I would really appreciate a response as I have taken the time to express my concern for my daughter as well as others who are probably grasping at straws for all the hope they have for their children.

Dear Gov. B. Perdue,

I live in the New Hill area and just wanted to ask if you knew that loggers were cutting timber on State land near Jordan Lake.† I was wondering who commissioned the loggers to cut the timber and who gets the money from the sale of the timber.† The other question that crossed my mind is why are they cutting the timber to begin with.† Since I am a citizen and taxpayer of North Carolina I feel I have a right to ask these questions and a right to have an answer because I live in that neighborhood.†
I recently have had a logging service give me an estimate for cutting some timber I have in Bladen County and they quoted me about $200.00-$300.00 per acre.† So I got to thinking for the state that isn't even a drop in the bucket so why go to all that trouble unless there are bigger plans for that land, or which I am very interested in.†
Thank you in advance for your attention and concern for†this matter.†

Subject: Banking overdraft fees/copy of letter sent to Burr and Hagan

Comment: I want to inform you as to what Bank Of America is now doing with their overdraft fees. They are waiting 36 hours to post an overdraft fee into accounts. The only reason I can think of to do this is so that the customers believe they have money in their accounts when in fact they are overdrawn. Not only are they doing this shady practice but they are also charging an additional $35.00 for another overdraft fee if you are overdrawn for more than five days. They do not even give you a full seven days any longer. We only get paid every seven days. We bail the banks out and that's how they treat their customers? I am appauld by these actions. They say they are here for the consumers but what they really mean is they are here for the RICH consumers. I am currently attempting to get disability so my husband and I are living on $350.00 a week. Three weeks ago Bank of America took over $100.00 of our $350.00 in so called legitimate overdraft fees. We live on next to nothing so we can pay our bills and then BOA takes money from our account. When we spoke with BOA we were told it these were legitimate charges and they were not going to do anything to assist us. I am writing you in hopes that you can assist the poor working class people in the great state of North Carolina. Something has to be done with all these banks that receive money from the taxpayers and then increase all their fees for the working poor. Who do they think gave them those millions of dollars for a bail out? Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time, Patricia A. Wich

Subject: Envelope

Comment: I would like to make a suggestion that the State of NC and City of Raleigh NC look into the use of 2way envelopes. The envelopes also come in eco friendly types also. This could help in quicker return billings and reduced cost of envelopes. I also would like to say I do not have any interest in envelope sales or commissions and in any way would profit from their use. I just personally think the 2way envelopes make good sense and send a good message to the public. Sincerely John Kapili 2014 Nappa Valley Ct Fuquay Varina, NC 27526 919-400-7321

Subject: Appointment to the Council on the Holocaust

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, My name is Angela Eichhorn Perry, and I am seeking re-instatment to the N.C. Council on the Holocaust. I have been a member of the Council for 3 1/2 years. I did not realize it was time for me to seek renewal, and as my husband was in Duke Hospital around that time, I let it slip my mind. If there is ANY way you can re-appointment me, it would really be appreciated! I have faithfully served on the Council, and I am sure Michael Abramson will give you a great recommendation if you need one. Some background on me: I am a media coordinator with the Pender County Schools, with 25 years experience. I have been a Holocaust Educator for the last 15 years. I have attended all but one of the NCCAT (North Carolina Center for the Advancement of Teaching) Holocaust Educators regatherings, was one of 25 educators from across the state NCCAT selected to go to Germany and Poland last year, I have started a Holocaust Lending Library at the Pender County Public Library strictly through donations, and have presented at many conferences local, regional and state level. I was recently selected to presented at the American Library Association's National Conference on using picture books with the holocaust. I would appreciate anything you can do to help me out. I can be reached at 910-604-1763 if you need to talk to me. My mailing address is Angela Perry, 58 Jenn Road, Burgaw, N.C. 28425. Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Subject: Commercial Hemp

Comment: The US uses and needs commercial hemp. In fact, more is exported to the US than to any other country-but we are not allowed to grow it, due to the DEA. Several states are trying to get permission to grow it-why isn't NC one of them? Commercial hemp would be a great addition to NC farmers. It is the fastest growing biomass, uses few pesticides, no herbicides, has numerous uses and would give us local income we are currently giving to other countries. Please have your team study this issue and find a resolution. This is a resource that could really help out state. Thank you, Mary Ann Dye

Subject: Plea for financial assistance!

Comment: I read in the news today that CEO's of banks that got bailouts with taxpayer monies continued to receive bonuses and expensive perks even after the bailouts were received. This is egregious behavior and speaks to the fact that corporate America receives special consideration from our elected officials, whereas the common taxpayers get little to no consideration or assistance. As proof of this, I have emailed my state representative Sue Myrick several times over the past year pleading for help with my SBA loan. My business has taken a huge downturn over the past 2 years, to the point that we are on the verge of going of out business. I am a decorated Gulf War veteran and served as a Navy doctor from 1988 to 1992. All I have asked is for help refinancing my SBA business loan so the monthly payments are not quite so onerous. I do not want to default on my loan. I want to pay it off like a good citizen. But I need some help or I will have to default and go out of business. Can't someone in this government help me? I provide much needed medical care to the citizens of the Charlotte area. If my medical practice goes out of business, the consequences on the quality of medical care in my field will be dramatic. I am the best qualified physician in my specialty in this area. Please won't someone help me?

Subject: Mental Health services/funding

Comment: Dear Ms. Perdue, You must receive hundreds of emails a day. I have yet one more to add to your inbox. I have a great concern with the cut backs in mental health. The decision to eliminate group homes and/or funding for these services is an extreme disservice to our state and the families within that are in great need of them. This topic is very personal to me as my stepson is mentally retarded and has a great deal of 24-7 medical needs that cannot be provided at home. Simply stated, he needs round-the-clock care and constant supervision. He was born with a rare disorder, Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia (NKH), which is an inadequate supply of an enzyme necessary to break down glycine in the body. The abnormally high levels of glycine is toxic and has left him severely & profoundly mentally-retarded, autistic, non-verbal, aggressive, seizures... He is treated with life sustaining medications daily. In conjunction with his medical needs, we‚Äôve had a very long, turbulent road over the past year with his increasingly aggressive behavior. I can‚Äôt express to you how difficult it is to restrain this 14 year-old child, multiple times a day. I have literally walked away from him bitten, bruised and bleeding, many times. Being physically and emotionally drained, dealing with this day after day, we became desperate. We took him to the local emergency department and simply told them that we cannot handle him anymore. After three days of being cooped up in a rubber room in the ED and one week on the peds floor, he was temporarily placed into the Murdoch Center in Butner. After nearly a two month stay there, he was transferred to a local group home (Unity Residential Services, Willow Springs) last July. To sum up a really long story, he is NOW in an environment where he is thriving because of the 24-7 care, attention and routine that he desperately needs. I basically summarized some of the things we‚Äôve had to endure in recent years with him. I‚Äôm also going to copy and paste a letter below that will help explain more. This letter was written by his biological mother to the Murdoch Center back when he was not accepted into their behavior program. Ms. Perdue, please do not eliminate these group homes. Children and families NEED these services. It is my hope that you understand (through my eyes and experience) the necessity of these group homes. Thank you for your time. Kellie Faircloth Rob Chelette (biological father) LETTER TO MURDOCH CENTER To whom it may concern, At this time, we would like to initiate a formal appeal to the rejection of my son, Robert Chelette, from the 2-year PATH program at the Murdoch Center . I believe the decision by the admission committee to be a grave mistake. We have spoken with several individuals that deal with Robert on a daily basis regarding this decision and his behaviors, including teachers and administrators at his school (East Milbrook Middle School), staff at UNC Hospitals that dealt with him during his stay there (specifically Dr. McKeenan), administrators at his provider agency for CAP/MR/DD services (Coordinated Health), and various other professionals that deal with special need children. These people have all echoed our sentiments that Robert is one of the most behaviorally-challenging children that they have experienced in their years in this field. In fact, one of these people informed us that if Robert is released into our care subsequent to his stay at the Murdoch Center , they will contact Child Protective Services in Wake County due to the fact that Robert‚Äôs behaviors are so severe that it would put him and our other children at risk. In recent months, there is an increased intensity and broader scope of Robert‚Äôs aggressive behaviors, which include property destruction, bodily injury to his parents and step-parents, and attempts to attack his 3 year-old brother. His brother is now fearful of Robert, and rightfully so having had to watch his mother aggressively and relentlessly being attacked by Robert. We have pictures from several recent incidents where Robert has badly bruised, bitten, and scratched us. The physicians at UNC Hospitals also have photos that were taken of us with marks and bruising, as well as several employees that were injured during his short stay there (including a broken wrist suffered by a nurse). Robert is no stranger to the PATH program. He was admitted for a 90 day respite period in 2006. For some time following that period, Robert exhibited improvements in behavior, self-help skills, and communication. This definitively demonstrated the success of the PATH program. However, in the period between 2006 and now, Robert‚Äôs behavior has degenerated steadily and severely. These extreme changes seem to coincide with the onset of puberty. We have tried many other avenues, including searching for specialized programs, exploring additional behavior medications, and placement in group homes (which have declined Robert based on the severity of his behaviors). Since the PATH program was so successful, we considered this to be the best option for Robert. Our feelings were correct, because while in PATH for the last 30 days Robert‚Äôs aggressive behavior has been significantly curbed. He is a completely different child. This, again, demonstrates the success of the PATH program in proving the type of environment and structure that Robert can thrive in. Any decision made on the basis of Robert‚Äôs behavior while currently in the PATH program are based on a gross misconception of the severity and intensity of his aggressive behaviors. We believe that a grave mistake was made by the admission board. Therefore, based on these and the following issues, we formally appeal the admission decision: -Robert has severe behavioral challenges that impede his safety and those around him. These include but are not limited to: closed fist hitting, open fist hitting, clawing, biting, hair pulling, scratching, throwing objects, running off, dropping ‚Äúdead weight‚Äù and aggressively attacking when attempting to move him, getting out of seat belt and attacking driver in moving car. -His behaviors are continuous and directly affect his ability to learn important daily life skills. This is exemplified by the refusal of therapists to work with him based on his aggressive behavior (OT, PT, rehab tech, etc.) -His behaviors are intense and cause injury w/ individuals who are not physically able to restrain him (brothers, grandparents, teachers, workers, mother, etc.) -He has been declined from several group home placements due to his behavioral needs. I urge you to reconsider Roberts application so that he has the time to learn goals in an environment that is able to help control old and teach new appropriate behaviors to him. Thank you, Lori and Michael Wyde

Signs Gas Chamber Ban http://www.animallawcoalition.com/gas-chambers/article/710 "A Heartless Job" Yes, I Gas Dogs and Cats for a Living. I'm an Animal Control officer in a very small town in central North Carolina. I'm in my mid thirties, and have been working for the town in different positions since high school. There is not much work here, and working for the county provides good pay and benefits for a person like me without a higher education. I'm the person you all write about how horrible I am. I'm the one that gasses the dogs and cats and makes them suffer. I'm the one that pulls their dead corpses out smelling of Carbon Monoxide and throws them into green plastic bags. But I'm also the one that hates my job and hates what I have to do. First off, all you people out there that judge me, don't. God is judging me, and I know I'm going to Hell. Yes, I'm going to hell. I wont lie, it's despicable, cold, cruel and I feel like a serial killer. I'm not all to blame, if the law would mandate spay and neuter, lots of these dogs and cats wouldn't be here for me to gas. I'm the devil, I know it, but I want you people to see that there is another side to me the devil Gas Chamber man. The shelter usually gasses on Friday morning. Friday's are the day that most people look forward to, this is the day that I hate, and wish that time will stand still on Thursday night. Thursday night, late, after nobody's around, my friend and I go through a fast food line, and buy 50 dollars worth of cheeseburgers and fries, and chicken. I'm not allowed to feed the dogs on Thursday, for I'm told that they will make a mess in the gas chamber, and why waste the food. So, Thursday night, with the lights still closed, I go into the saddest room that anyone can every imagine, and let all the doomed dogs out out their cages. I have never been bit, and in all my years doing this, the dogs have never fought over the food. My buddy and I, open each wrapper of cheeseburger and chicken sandwich, and feed them to the skinny, starving dogs. They swallow the food so fast, that I don't believe they even taste it. There tails are wagging, and some don't even go for the food, they roll on their backs wanting a scratch on their bellys. They start running, jumping and kissing me and my buddy. They go back to their food, and come back to us. All their eyes are on us with such trust and hope, and their tails wag so fast, that I have come out with black and blues on my thighs.. They devour the food, then it's time for them to devour some love and peace. My buddy and I sit down on the dirty, pee stained concrete floor, and we let the dogs jump on us. They lick us, they put their butts in the air to play, and they play with each other. Some lick each other, but most are glued on me and my buddy. I look into the eyes of each dog. I give each dog a name. They will not die without a name. I give each dog 5 minutes of unconditional love and touch. I talk to them, and tell them that I'm so sorry that tomorrow they will die a gruesome, long, torturous death at the hands of me in the gas chamber. Some tilt their heads to try to understand. I tell them, that they will be in a better place, and I beg them not to hate me. I tell them that I know I'm going to hell, but they will all be playing with all the dogs and cats in heaven. After about 30 minutes, I take each dog individually, into their feces filled concrete jail cell, and pet them and scratch them under their chins. Some give me their paw, and I just want to die. I just want to die. I close the jail cell on each dog, and ask them to forgive me. As my buddy and I are walking out, we watch as every dog is smiling at us and them don't even move their heads. They will sleep, with a full belly, and a false sense of security. As we walk out of the doomed dog room, my buddy and I go to the cat room. We take our box, and put the very friendly kittens and pregnant cats in our box. The shelter doesn't keep tabs on the cats, like they do the dogs. As I hand pick which cats are going to make it out, I feel like I'm playing God, deciding whose going to live and die. We take the cats into my truck, and put them on blankets in the back. Usually, as soon as we start to drive away, there are purring cats sitting on our necks or rubbing against us. My buddy and I take our one way two hour trip to a county that is very wealthy and they use injection to kill animals. We go to exclusive neighborhoods, and let one or two cats out at a time. They don't want to run, they want to stay with us. We shoo them away, which makes me feel sad. I tell them that these rich people will adopt them, and if worse comes to worse and they do get put down, they will be put down with a painless needle being cradled by a loving veterinarian. After the last cat is free, we drive back to our town. It's about 5 in the morning now, about two hours until I have to gas my best friends. I go home, take a shower, take my 4 anti-anxiety pills and drive to work.. I don't eat, I can't eat. It's now time, to put these animals in the gas chamber. I put my ear plugs in, and when I go to the collect the dogs, the dogs are so excited to see me, that they jump up to kiss me and think they are going to play. I put them in the rolling cage and take them to the gas chamber. They know. They just know. They can smell the death.. They can smell the fear. They start whimpering, the second I put them in the box. The boss tells me to squeeze in as many as I can to save on gas. He watches. He knows I hate him, he knows I hate my job. I do as I'm told. He watches until all the dogs, and cats (thrown in together) are fighting and screaming. The sounds is very muffled to me because of my ear plugs. He walks out, I turn the gas on, and walk out. I walk out as fast as I can. I walk into the bathroom, and I take a pin and draw blood from my hand. Why? The pain and blood takes my brain off of what I just did. In 40 minutes, I have to go back and unload the dead animals. I pray that none survived, which happens when I overstuff the chamber. I pull them out with thick gloves, and the smell of carbon monoxide makes me sick. So does the vomit and blood, and all the bowel movements. I pull them out, put them in plastic bags. They are in heaven now, I tell myself. I then start cleaning up the mess, the mess, that YOU PEOPLE are creating by not spay or neutering your animals. The mess that YOU PEOPLE are creating by not demanding that a vet come in and do this humanely. You ARE THE TAXPAYERS, DEMAND that this practice STOP! So, don't call me the monster, the devil, the gasser, call the politicians, the shelter directors, and the county people the devil. Heck, call the governor, tell him to make it stop. As usual, I will take sleeping pills tonight to drown out the screams I heard in the past, before I discovered the ear plugs. I will jump and twitch in my sleep, and I believe I'm starting to hallucinate. This is my life. Don't judge me. Believe me, I judge myself enough.

† We the people of the Central Park Community are in need of our governments help.

† Central Park is a small community located in Kannapolis, North Carolina and comprised of approximately 110 homes.† My name is James Dale and I am the President of the Home Owners Association for Central Park.† Please let me explain our dilemma.

† Back in 2002-2003 the developer Hawfield and his attorney started this subdivision only to be cut short due to the fact they broke the law on several counts of real estate fraud which is still pending in the courts.† Ron Overcash then† took over the property and he and PNN Builders proceeded to build the community.† They advertised a wonderful development, complete with amenities such as a playground, inground pool and clubhouse.

† What we received instead was and still is a total nightmare.† Not only did we†receive no amenities but the land was left an absolute mess.† Building material, appliances, concrete, etc. was left everywhere you could see, an HOA that was not set up properly at all and a developer who put all the property deeded common area in his name.

† After two solid years of constant work by certain people in the subdivision we finally established the HOA legally and cleaned up almost all of the community and with some help from the city of Kannapolis were able to get streets, and sidewalks finished.

† That's all great but our biggest and most important challenge is at hand.† Mr. Overcash has been a nightmare and has singlehandly put this community at risk.† He has informed people not to pay their homerowner dues simply because he owns the common areas and will not turn them over to the community.† This was suppose to be done when the subdivision was 80% complete.† Mr. Overcash now wants the community to pay him for the common areas and to pay the taxes owed by him for the common areas.† Mr. Overcash changed the tax code status on the common areas 2 years ago and has not paid†a dime in taxes that he rightfully owes.

† Mr. Overcash in June of 2009 drew up his own deed and gave a piece of the common area property to his son.† The problem is no one seems to care, from the town right up to every official in the state of North Carolina, who I have wrote to before.

† Everyone in the Central Park community is in a serious dilemma.

A - without payments which people are afraid to pay due to Mr. Overcash's threats, the HOA will be broke and absolved by Nov. 1, 2009.

B - we cannot sell our homes due to the economic slide caused by government and banks.† We would take a 15-25K hit just to get out.

C - people have and will just continue to leave their homes and let the banks take†over, continuing to destroy property values in the subdivision.

D - unless the HOA receives a grant or some financial help to continue, we are fighting a losing battle and this community will soon become a renter's paradise†
†††† and you†know what that leads to, trouble and crime.

† I cannot begin to tell you the heartache and grief that I have gone through as well as others in the past year.

† We are all hard working Americans who need a little help before everything we worked for is literally taken from us right before our very eyes.

† Please let us know ASAP what you can do to salvage this Great Community.† Remember time is a commodity we do not possess.

† Please respond within 48 hours.

Thank you for your time
Sincerely,

James Dale

Subject: Miss treatment by the Army

Comment: My family is in great need of help. My husband has 14 years in the army and has been deployed 3 times. He currently works with the Warrior Transition battalion on Fort Bragg North Carolina. His command has recently charged him with an article 15 and their acquisitions are completely false and he has provided adequate evidence to prove his innocence. His command has given him the max punishment on an article 15; 45 days extra duty, half pay for 2 months, and reduction in rank. We appealed the decision and requested a lesser punishment or at least a suspension of the charges but were completely denied, with no explanation at all. I am currently 29 weeks pregnant and I have a 2 year old at home. My husband also pays over $900 a month in child support. These charges are going to make it where we cannot pay our bills. The command at the WTB has been giving my husband a hard time ever since the Article 15 took place. They have gone before company formations and all the personal business of my husband‚Äôs article 15 out to the whole unit also they threatened other soldiers saying ‚Äúif anyone helped in an investigation would have been brought upon them‚Äù. The TDS member we have spoke to gave us all the information we needed in this trial and doesn‚Äôt understand how they could still find him guilty of charges and neither do I. I have copies of all charges and evidence we provided and I hope that I can get some assistance on this matter. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I feel this unit is not following the rules under UCMJ the command has to find him guilty without a doubt. There is no doubt in my mind or anyone who has read our case that my husband is not guilty of charges and this punishment is completely out of line. Please help me!! and my husband.

Subject: Support Healthy Kids Through Quality PE

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: In July 2009, the Trust for America's Health ranked North Carolina as the state with the 14th highest rate of overweight and obese children age 10 -- 17. This ranking has very serious implications for children's health in North Carolina and for health care costs. Our state already struggles with high rates of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. Overweight and obese children face a much greater risk of developing these diseases -- so much so that the average overweight North Carolina child will accrue $28,619 in direct medical expenses by the midpoint of his/her career and over $250,000 in direct health care costs by his or her retirement. We need to get obesity under control now, and one of the most cost-effective ways to do that is through quality physical education. Studies show that 56% of our state's high school students and 45% of middle school students do not get the recommended amount of physical activity. Bringing PE back to schools will help get our kids healthy, improve behavior and academic performance and save millions in future obesity-related health care costs. North Carolina cannot afford to let the childhood obesity epidemic continue. Please restore regular, quality physical education to our schools this year. Sincerely, Jovanna Wilder PO Box 30513 Raleigh, NC 27622-0513

Subject: All NC Workers Deserves Smoke-free Protection

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: A new Institute of Medicine report confirms that smoke-free policies save lives. The report, released yesterday, verifies that secondhand smoke from cigarettes can cause acute coronary events such as heart attack and chest pain. This report follows an earlier study documenting that heart attack rates dropped 17 percent one year after implementation of smoke-free laws and continued to decline over time, with about a 36 percent drop three years after enacting the restrictions. Thanks to passage of HB2, North Carolinians can expect similar health benefits when our smoke-free policy is implemented in January. Studies like these demonstrate that smoke-free polices improve public health in many ways. In addition to protecting people from lung cancer and other respiratory illnesses, smoke-free laws also help reduce cardiovascular disease, which is the leading killer in North Carolina and the nation. We know having smoke-free restaurants and bars in North Carolina will prevent heart attacks and save lives. Extending our smoke-free policy to cover all workers would save even more lives. As your constituent, I invite you to read the new IOM report at www.iom.edu and consider the benefits of allowing all North Carolina workers to be protected by our smoke-free law. Thank you for your efforts to improve public health in North Carolina. Sincerely, Jovanna Wilder PO Box 30513 Raleigh, NC 27622-0513

Comment: Please do something to stop this release. Are you going to feel responsible when they abduct some young girl because they can't get sex from anyone else???????? I would just as soon drop ALL of the hundreds of thousands of prisioners on an island and let them fend for themselves. The sooner the better. We have Republicans who raise cain about helping low income families but we have thousands who are sucking the system dry with free health care, food, and a roof over their heads. Dump them all. Please do something to stop this release.

> proposed this legislation in March with Attorney General Roy Cooper. It
> was sponsored by Sen. Rand (D-Bladen, Cumberland).
>
> "This legislation puts the safety of our patients first by ensuring that

> Perdue. "By increasing transparency, we will make state facilities more
> accountable to the people in their care, restore public confidence and
> rebuild public trust."
>
> Senate Bill 799 will require the following information regarding deaths
> in state facilities to be public information:
>
> - The name, sex, age and date of birth of the deceased;
> - The name of the facility providing the report;
> - The date, time and location of the death;
> - A brief description of the circumstances of death, including the manner
> of death if known; and
> - A list of all entities to whom the event was reported.
>
> "More disclosure can shine a light on problems and help ensure patients'
> safety.  Our investigators and prosecutors will continue to enforce the
> law against those who abuse patients in state facilities," said Cooper.
>
> "Transforming the state's facilities into a true system of care is
> foremost, and part of that transformation means operating in a climate of

>
> The federal Energy Department is recommending that states focus the

> The legislation would subject the dams that create coal ash ponds to
> direct inspection by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural

>
> "Because of where some of the ponds are located, greater safety oversight

>
> A "high hazard" designation was created in the 1980's for coal ash
> impoundments and other similar dams that are near densely populated areas

>
> Currently, power companies are only required to file reports every five

> impoundments are exempt from regulation under the N.C. Dam Safety Act.

> The proposal will be sponsored by Rep. Pricey Harrison of Greensboro and

Subject: Mental Health funding/services

Comment: Dear Ms. Perdue, You must receive hundreds of emails a day. I have yet one more to add to your inbox. I have a great concern with the cut backs in mental health. The decision to eliminate group homes and/or funding for these services is an extreme disservice to our state and the families within that are in great need of them. This topic is very personal to me as my stepson is mentally retarded and has a great deal of 24-7 medical needs that cannot be provided at home. Simply stated, he needs round-the-clock care and constant supervision. He was born with a rare disorder, Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia (NKH), which is an inadequate supply of an enzyme necessary to break down glycine in the body. The abnormally high levels of glycine is toxic and has left him severely & profoundly mentally-retarded, autistic, non-verbal, aggressive, seizures... He is treated with life sustaining medications daily. In conjunction with his medical needs, we‚Äôve had a very long, turbulent road over the past year with his increasingly aggressive behavior. I can‚Äôt express to you how difficult it is to restrain this 14 year-old child, multiple times a day. I have literally walked away from him bitten, bruised and bleeding, many times. Being physically and emotionally drained, dealing with this day after day, we became desperate. We took him to the local emergency department and simply told them that we cannot handle him anymore. After three days of being cooped up in a rubber room in the ED and one week on the peds floor, he was temporarily placed into the Murdoch Center in Butner. After nearly a two month stay there, he was transferred to a local group home (Unity Residential Services, Willow Springs) last July. To sum up a really long story, he is NOW in an environment where he is thriving because of the 24-7 care, attention and routine that he desperately needs. I basically summarized some of the things we‚Äôve had to endure in recent years with him. I‚Äôm also going to copy and paste a letter below that will help explain more. This letter was written by his biological mother to the Murdoch Center back when he was not accepted into their behavior program. Ms. Perdue, please do not eliminate these group homes. Children and families NEED these services. It is my hope that you understand (through my eyes and experience) the necessity of these group homes. Thank you for your time. Kellie Faircloth Rob Chelette (biological father) LETTER TO MURDOCH CENTER To whom it may concern, At this time, we would like to initiate a formal appeal to the rejection of my son, Robert Chelette, from the 2-year PATH program at the Murdoch Center . I believe the decision by the admission committee to be a grave mistake. We have spoken with several individuals that deal with Robert on a daily basis regarding this decision and his behaviors, including teachers and administrators at his school (East Milbrook Middle School), staff at UNC Hospitals that dealt with him during his stay there (specifically Dr. McKeenan), administrators at his provider agency for CAP/MR/DD services (Coordinated Health), and various other professionals that deal with special need children. These people have all echoed our sentiments that Robert is one of the most behaviorally-challenging children that they have experienced in their years in this field. In fact, one of these people informed us that if Robert is released into our care subsequent to his stay at the Murdoch Center , they will contact Child Protective Services in Wake County due to the fact that Robert‚Äôs behaviors are so severe that it would put him and our other children at risk. In recent months, there is an increased intensity and broader scope of Robert‚Äôs aggressive behaviors, which include property destruction, bodily injury to his parents and step-parents, and attempts to attack his 3 year-old brother. His brother is now fearful of Robert, and rightfully so having had to watch his mother aggressively and relentlessly being attacked by Robert. We have pictures from several recent incidents where Robert has badly bruised, bitten, and scratched us. The physicians at UNC Hospitals also have photos that were taken of us with marks and bruising, as well as several employees that were injured during his short stay there (including a broken wrist suffered by a nurse). Robert is no stranger to the PATH program. He was admitted for a 90 day respite period in 2006. For some time following that period, Robert exhibited improvements in behavior, self-help skills, and communication. This definitively demonstrated the success of the PATH program. However, in the period between 2006 and now, Robert‚Äôs behavior has degenerated steadily and severely. These extreme changes seem to coincide with the onset of puberty. We have tried many other avenues, including searching for specialized programs, exploring additional behavior medications, and placement in group homes (which have declined Robert based on the severity of his behaviors). Since the PATH program was so successful, we considered this to be the best option for Robert. Our feelings were correct, because while in PATH for the last 30 days Robert‚Äôs aggressive behavior has been significantly curbed. He is a completely different child. This, again, demonstrates the success of the PATH program in proving the type of environment and structure that Robert can thrive in. Any decision made on the basis of Robert‚Äôs behavior while currently in the PATH program are based on a gross misconception of the severity and intensity of his aggressive behaviors. We believe that a grave mistake was made by the admission board. Therefore, based on these and the following issues, we formally appeal the admission decision: -Robert has severe behavioral challenges that impede his safety and those around him. These include but are not limited to: closed fist hitting, open fist hitting, clawing, biting, hair pulling, scratching, throwing objects, running off, dropping ‚Äúdead weight‚Äù and aggressively attacking when attempting to move him, getting out of seat belt and attacking driver in moving car. -His behaviors are continuous and directly affect his ability to learn important daily life skills. This is exemplified by the refusal of therapists to work with him based on his aggressive behavior (OT, PT, rehab tech, etc.) -His behaviors are intense and cause injury w/ individuals who are not physically able to restrain him (brothers, grandparents, teachers, workers, mother, etc.) -He has been declined from several group home placements due to his behavioral needs. I urge you to reconsider Roberts application so that he has the time to learn goals in an environment that is able to help control old and teach new appropriate behaviors to him. Thank you, Lori and Michael Wyde

As you may know, this Report Card was developed by the American College of Emergency Physicians and it grades each state in the categories of Access to Emergency Care, the Quality and Patient Safety Environment, the Medical Liability Environment, Public Health and Injury Prevention, and Disaster Preparedness. After seeing our state's results, I am concerned about some of the significant problems that threaten our access to timely, lifesaving emergency care. ¬† If you have not had a chance to review our state's report card, I urge you to do so by going to www.emreportcard.org. I would then strongly encourage you to help take the lead in working to address some of the critical problems facing the emergency care system in our state. Sincerely, Rolland Phillips 704-795-6100
