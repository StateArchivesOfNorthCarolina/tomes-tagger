Economic Recovery Workshop in Western N.C.

Gov. Bev Perdue and the Office of Economic Recovery and Investment (OERI) will hold the second in a series of statewide economic recovery workshops to provide information to local municipalities, businesses and interested citizens on how the federal recovery funds will be administered.

Gov. Perdue will speak at the May 11 workshop, to be held at 12p.m. in Haywood Community College’s Charles M. Beale Auditorium in Clyde, N.C.

Workshop attendees will hear from representatives of state and federal agencies administering the recovery funds, who will discuss the current status of funds, detail upcoming opportunities and explain the mechanisms for participation in the process.

Additional workshops will be held in Greenville, Charlotte, Raleigh and Wilmington in the next few weeks. Details will be announced soon. For more information, visit <http://www.ncrecovery.gov/>www.NCRecovery.gov.

Governor Perdue Announces Public Water Supply Projects

Gov. Perdue today announced that nearly $40.5 million will be awarded to 35 communities in 28 counties for public water supply projects from the first-round distribution of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.

“These projects will create jobs, boost the economy and improve public water supply infrastructure in all parts of North Carolina,” said Gov. Perdue.

Project awards made by the Division of Environmental Health totaled $40,381,153. Towns from Kill Devil Hills – for tank mixers to improve water quality – to Andrews – for storage lagoon replacement – to Green Level for an elevated storage tank – will benefit from the program.

Johnston County, Green County, Catawba County, Perquimans County, Morehead City and Farmville, were each awarded the maximum amount allowed by the ARRA program: $3 million. The full list of first-round award recipients is now available at:  <http://www.deh.enr.state.nc.us/pws/recovery.htm>www.deh.enr.state.nc.us/pws/recovery.htm.

Six of the 35 first-round projects to receive funding are “green” projects that include public water supply treatment upgrades and waterline replacements. Round One funding committed for these projects is nearly $4.3 million. Since the ARRA requires that at least 20 percent of all the monies awarded be spent on green projects, approximately $9 million will be available for eligible green projects in Round Two funding.

Governor Perdue Creates StreetSafe Task Force to Reduce Repeat Offenders

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced the StreetSafe Task Force, an initiative to reduce the number of ex-offenders who commit crimes after their release from prison.

The task force will bring together faith-based organizations, non-profits, local and state government agencies, business leaders and members of the community to develop a plan to combat recidivism and reintegrate offenders safely into the community.

"Citizen and community safety is a major priority in North Carolina,” said Perdue.  “StreetSafe will protect our communities, prevent ex-offenders from repeating crimes and provide them with the support they need to restart their lives.”

Attorney General Roy Cooper and Correction Secretary Al Keller will serve as co-chairs of the StreetSafe Task Force.

“Law enforcement officers too often see criminals they’ve arrested and convicted go right back to their old ways as soon as they get out of prison,” Cooper said. “Stopping criminals from repeating their crimes will make all of us safer.”

"It will take a commitment from all of us to address the challenges faced by ex-offenders” Keller said. “The work of the StreetSafe Task Force will benefit everyone who is working to help ex-offenders become productive taxpaying citizens."

Studies show that 36 percent of ex-offenders in North Carolina are sent back to prison for committing new crimes within three years of their release.  StreetSafe can provide an avenue for ex-offenders’ safe reentry into communities across North Carolina and for developing a network of support for them.

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/UploadedFiles/2f559969-62d8-47c9-81b0-3c7e9165c298.pdf>Governor Perdue signed Executive Order No. 12 creating the StreetSafe Task Force (PDF).

Governor Perdue Receives School Connectivity Awards

On Thursday, Governor Perdue received three awards for her leadership on school connectivity.  She received the Leadership in Distance Learning Program Administration Award from the NC Distance Learning Association, the Outstanding Leadership by an Individual in the Field of Distance Learning from the U.S. Distance Learning Association, and the USDLA Eagle Award.

Governor Perdue received the awards at the School Connectivity Celebration, celebrating that all 115 K-12 public school districts in North Carolina are now connected to the North Carolina Research and Education Network (NCREN).

Governor Announces ARRA Funding for NC Americorps Programs

Gov. Perdue this week announced that the North Carolina Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service received $891,387 in American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) funding to expand the capacity of four of its existing AmeriCorps programs.

“This funding makes sure that our AmeriCorps programs and the important services they provide will continue to benefit the people of North Carolina,” said Gov. Perdue.  “Through these programs, at-risk children and families in need will continue receiving the services they need.”

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=347>For a list of the programs that will receive funding click here.

The North Carolina Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service, a federal and state-funded agency housed in the Governor’s Office, administers funding for North Carolina AmeriCorps programs.  For more information on the AmeriCorps programs, visit <http://www.VolunteerNC.org>wwwVolunteerNC.org or call 1-800-820-4483.

Biotechnology Firms to Add 128 Jobs in Wake County

Bayer CropScience LP, a leading plant science company specializing in crop protection, non-agricultural pest control, seeds and plant biotechnology, will expand in Wake County.  The company plans to create 128 new jobs and invest $10.2 million during the next five years in Morrisville.

“North Carolina is a recognized world leader in biotechnology manufacturing and research,” Gov. Perdue said. “Our state continues to support the expansion of global companies attracted by our top-rated business climate, knowledge-based workforce and unparalleled quality of life.”

The state’s Economic Investment Committee met today and voted unanimously to award a Job Development Investment Grant to Bayer CropScience LP to facilitate this expansion.  While wages will vary by position, the average annual wage for the 128 new jobs is $101,018 not including benefits, which exceeds the Wake County average wage of $43,160.

The company plans to open the Bayer CropScience Research and Development Innovation Center in Morrisville, leasing existing laboratory and office space to conduct basic plant research across a range of technology and crop platforms.  Additionally, the Innovation Center will house the company’s BioAnalytics and Regulatory Affairs functions, which support the development and commercialization of biotech products.

Rowan County Gets New Textile Manufacturer, 223 Jobs

Sustainable Textile Group LLC, a national manufacturer of fabric made from pre-consumer waste, will establish a new facility in Rowan County.  The company plans to invest $11 million and create 223 jobs in China Grove during the next two years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $300,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

“North Carolina continues to support growth in our evolving textile industry and offers companies the opportunity to adapt and tap into new markets,” said Gov. Perdue.  “Our state is the ideal place for companies to relocate and expand, thanks to our skilled workforce and top business climate.”

Sustainable Textile Group LLC is part of the Sustainable Solutions Network of companies, which includes Sustainable Solutions Inc., Strateline Industries LLC and Circle LLC.  The companies offer a wide range of sustainable products and services.  Those include non-woven fabrics made from regenerated cotton fibers.  The fabric is used in items such as personal wipes and other non-woven materials for the home furnishing, medical and automotive industries.

Gov. Perdue's Statement Regarding the H1N1 Virus

As you know, North Carolina is one of 38 states with a confirmed case of the novel H1N1 flu virus.  As of today, North Carolina has 7 confirmed cases in Onslow, Craven and Carteret Counties.  The patients have been in isolation, and a thorough investigation already has been conducted by local and state public health officials.

Let me reassure you that North Carolina is as prepared as any state in the country.  We have national models for preparedness and response, and we are in constant contact with the CDC.

I want to thank public health officials including the Public Health Command Center, the State Lab and the many local health departments that have been working around the clock since the beginning of this outbreak.  I also would like to thank State Health Director Dr. Jeffrey Engel and DHHS Secretary Lanier Cansler for their leadership.

In addition to our public health officials, we all play a part in keeping this disease from spreading.  Practice good hygiene, wash hands with soap and warm water, and cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.  If you are sick, don't go to work or to school but stay home.  If your child is sick, keep them at home.

By working together, I am confident we can protect the public health of North Carolina.

Sincerely,

Thank you very much for your attention, Governor Perdue and Staff.

I want to ask for tax relief for an elderly couple who have paid taxes since 1932, and who have received extremely little in return.  They have taken care of our Illegals, our Lazy,  our young Parents Who Don't Have to Work because tax monies take care of them,  our Employees of Governments,  federal, state, and county,  some of whom verbally abuse taxpayers,  our Law Enforcement Personnel who are helpless to guard the elderly from trespassers,  and from harassers on the highway and the phone.

Have they not paid and worked enough for the governments that care not a whit for them?

I suggest they be given a break, finally.  Enough already.

Sincerely,
Jane Greenwood, MDiv

State Grant Helps Siemens Energy Expand in Charlotte

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced that Siemens Energy Inc., an international supplier of products and services for the generation, transmission and distribution of power, will expand its operations in Mecklenburg County.  The company plans to invest nearly $50 million and create 226 jobs in Charlotte during the next five years.

> <Newsletter Logo.jpg>“North Carolina is an international leader in innovative power and energy production, research and design,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Our state continues to be attractive to leading-edge global companies looking to invest and expand here, thanks to our top-rated business climate, world-class research facilities, and skill and knowledge-based workforce.”

> The state’s Economic Investment Committee met Thursday and voted unanimously to award a Job Development Investment Grant to Siemens Energy to facilitate this expansion.  Under terms of the performance-based grant, the average annual wage of the 226 new jobs will start at $49,082 in 2009 and increase to $66,463 in 2013, not including benefits.  That compares favorably with the Mecklenburg County average wage of $49,400.

> Siemens currently employs 780 workers at the project location in Charlotte and has separate operations in Wake County and Forsyth County.  The new jobs in Charlotte will include engineering employees and manufacturing workers.  The engineering group will be housed in a 75,000-square-foot office facility, to be built adjacent to the existing manufacturing plant where the project’s other workers will be employed.

> Governor Perdue to Sign Smoking Ban Bill

Governor Perdue's statement regarding the smoking ban bill passed by the legislature Thursday:

>> "Today is an important and historic day for North Carolina – a day to applaud Rep. Hugh Holliman and Sen. Bill Purcell for protecting the health of North Carolinians.

>> I have vigorously supported efforts to reduce and eliminate smoking and this bill will help more North Carolina citizens avoid the dangers of secondhand smoke."

> Governor Perdue will sign the bill during a ceremony on Tuesday.

> "Click It or Ticket" Campaign

As a reminder of North Carolina’s seat belt laws and the importance of buckling up, Gov. Perdue announced today the launch of a statewide “Click It or Ticket” mobilization to crack down on motorists who are not wearing their seat belts. State and local law enforcement officers will step up enforcement activities during the May 18-31 campaign, which includes the Memorial Day holiday.

> “The busy summer travel season is just beginning. This is an excellent time to remind people of the importance of buckling up,” said Perdue. “It costs nothing to buckle your seat belt, but it could cost you your life if you don’t. Please remember that all of your passengers should be properly buckled in seatbelts or age-appropriate child safety seats.”

> In 2008, 484 unbuckled motorists died in North Carolina. Regular seat belt use is the single most effective way to protect people and reduce fatalities in motor vehicle crashes. When worn correctly, seat belts have been proven to reduce the risk of fatal injury to front-seat passenger car occupants by 45 percent and by 60 percent in pickup trucks, SUVs and minivans.

> “Click It or Ticket” is administered by the N.C. Governor’s Highway Safety Program. The program began as a national pilot project in 1993 to increase seat belt usage and child passenger safety through stepped-up enforcement of the state’s seat belt and child safety seat laws.

> Third Recovery Workshop on Monday in Kinston

The N.C. Office of Economic Recovery and Investment (OERI) will hold the third in a series of workshops across the state providing information and guidance to local municipalities, businesses and interested citizens on how the federal recovery funds will be administered. Gov. Perdue will speak at the May 18 workshop, to be held at 10 a.m. in Lenoir Community College’s Waller Auditorium in Kinston, N.C.

> <Newsletter Logo.jpg>Workshop attendees will have an opportunity to hear from representatives of state and federal agencies administering the recovery funds. These representatives will discuss the current status of funds in their agencies, detail upcoming opportunities and explain the mechanisms for participation in the process.

> “North Carolina is set to receive more than $8 billion in federal recovery money, and I intend for our state to not only be prepared to use this money to put our people back to work, but also to spend the money with the utmost accountability and transparency,” said Gov. Perdue. “These workshops will build the bridges between state, local and county governments – and anyone else interested in utilizing recovery funds – to ensure this money is used to benefit all of North Carolina and our people.”

> OERI Director Dempsey Benton will lead the two-hour workshop. For more information, visit <http://www.NCRecovery.gov>www.NCRecovery.gov. 

> Additional workshops will be held in the Charlotte, Raleigh and Wilmington areas in the next few weeks. Details will be announced soon. The first two workshops were held April 28 in Winston-Salem and May 11 in Clyde.

> The visitor spending figures are the preliminary results of an annual study conducted by the U.S. Travel Association for the N.C. Department of Commerce’s Division of Tourism, Film, and Sports Development. The study uses sales and tax revenue data and employment figures to determine the overall impact of visitor spending in North Carolina.

> “The tourism industry is a critical economic engine for North Carolina – and this continued growth in revenues is a positive sign,” said Gov. Perdue.  “From Murphy to Manteo, the Tar Heel state has countless treasures that attract visitors year after year.”

> The travel and tourism industry directly employs more than 190,000 North Carolinians and it generated a total of more than $1.3 billion in state and local tax revenues in 2008, up 3.1 percent from 2007.

Following is the question just received:
Visitor: Mr. Harold Beauvais

Address: 7417 Park Vista Circle, Charlotte, NC 28226

Email: alcando@juno.com

Subject: Homestead Expansion

Comment: Follow is from the bevperdue.com website "As North Carolina's next Governor, Bev will continue her long-term commitment to expand the homestead exemption by phasing its income limit up to $50,000 and maintaining the existing cost of living adjustment (COLA) in current law. Such an expansion will result in nearly 200,000 more seniors eligible for property tax relief. Coupled with the Homestead expansion, Bev Perdue will also freeze property tax evaluations for seniors who make less than $50,000 and have lived in their homes for more than 20 years." I realize that the current economic problems will probably slow down any action on this item but would like to know if any action is being taken or planned to be taken in the near future.

North Carolina Visitor Spending Rises to          $16.9 Billion in 2008

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that domestic visitors to and within North Carolina spent a record $16.9 billion in 2008, an increase of 2.1 percent from 2007 and higher than the previous record of $16.5 billion, set in 2007.

The visitor spending figures are the preliminary results of an annual study conducted by the U.S. Travel Association for the N.C. Department of Commerce’s Division of Tourism, Film, and Sports Development. The study uses sales and tax revenue data and employment figures to determine the overall impact of visitor spending in North Carolina.

“The tourism industry is a critical economic engine for North Carolina – and this continued growth in revenues is a positive sign,” said Gov. Perdue.  “From Murphy to Manteo, the Tar Heel state has countless treasures that attract visitors year after year.”

The travel and tourism industry directly employs more than 190,000 North Carolinians and it generated a total of more than $1.3 billion in state and local tax revenues in 2008, up 3.1 percent from 2007. 

North Carolina also moved up in a study from TNS TravelsAmerica. North Carolina was the sixth most visited state in 2008, up from the seventh most visited in 2007.

Gov. Perdue Recommends 16 Western N.C. Projects to the Appalachian Regional Commission

Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday announced the 16 community and regional Western North Carolina projects she will recommend to receive a total of $4 million from the Appalachian Regional Commission. She made the announcement in Brevard at Transylvania Vocational Services Inc., a company participating in one of the projects.

“These 16 community and regional projects represent Western North Carolina’s creativity and innovation,” said Gov. Perdue.  “They will bring needed jobs, education and training programs, housing and infrastructure improvements to this part of our state.”

ARC was created by the Congress in 1965 to improve the lives of the people in Appalachia. Federal funding is allocated to the 13 states that make up the Appalachian region. North Carolina counties eligible to receive funding are Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Caldwell, Cherokee, Clay, Davie, Forsyth, Graham, Haywood, Henderson, Jackson, McDowell, Macon, Madison, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford, Stokes, Surry, Swain, Transylvania, Watauga, Wilkes, Yadkin and Yancey.

> Gov. Perdue Announces Plan to Create Green Jobs

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx>Governor Bev Perdue this week announced her energy reform package to attract businesses, create jobs and promote a strong and sustainable green economy in North Carolina. She made the announcement at the SAS Solar Farm in Cary, which provides solar-generated power to Progress Energy.

> “Developing our green economy is a cornerstone of my vision for North Carolina’s economic future,” Gov. Perdue said. “Creating green jobs and businesses is a key part of my JobsNOW initiative, and the energy reforms I am implementing will lay the foundation for North Carolina to lead the nation in green energy.”

> Gov. Perdue’s energy plan refocuses state energy policymaking, makes strategic investments in North Carolina’s green economy and increases green-collar workforce development.

> “The state that gets green right will own the next 50 years,” Gov. Perdue said. “I intend for North Carolina to be that state.”

> Governor Perdue’s energy plan includes:

> - Relocating the State Energy Office and state weatherization program to the Department of Commerce

> - Reinvigorating the Energy Policy Council

> - Establishing an Energy Investment Revolving Loan Fund

> - Expanding the Green Business Fund

> - Growing North Carolina’s green workforce

> - Investing federal recovery monies for other energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in small businesses, communities and homes across North Carolina

> Governor Perdue Launches JobsNOW Portal

Gov. Bev Perdue today launched the <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW Portal, a user-friendly resource for job seekers, those exploring new career options, and entrepreneurs looking to start, grow or relocate a business in North Carolina.

> <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx>> “JobsNOW will help get our economy back on track and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future,” said Gov. Perdue.  “The JobsNOW Portal will be a valuable tool for job seekers and businesses looking to expand or relocate.”

> The JobsNOW Portal is part of Governor Perdue’s JobsNOW initiative, which brings together state agencies, local governments, business leaders and citizens to create new jobs, put people back to work and train and retrain our workers for success. 

> Other JobsNOW initiatives include Perdue’s recently announced Green Energy Plan, the “12 in 6” Worker Training Program, the Charlotte Area Workforce Recovery Plan and the N.C. Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.

> Gov. Perdue Signs Legislation Prohibiting Smoking in Bars and Restaurant

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday signed House Bill 2, which prohibits smoking in public bars and restaurants. Rep. Hugh Holliman and Sen. Bill Purcell led the efforts to pass this landmark legislation. The smoking ban will go into effect on Jan. 2, 2010, and will be enforced by local health directors.

> “This is a historic day for North Carolina,” said Gov. Perdue. “But more important than the history that we are making is the positive impact we are having on public health. By banning smoking in our restaurants and bars, we will greatly reduce the dangers of secondhand smoke and lower health care costs for families.”

> According to a report by the United States Surgeon General, secondhand smoke causes the death of approximately 50,000 citizens a year. In addition, a study prepared by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina found that exposure to secondhand smoke costs North Carolinians $289 million annually.

> "I am extremely happy with this legislation becoming a reality. This is a gigantic step in improving the public health for the citizens of our great state, and I'm glad I was able to play a part in making this bill a law," said Holliman.

> "This new law is a significant step for public health in North Carolina.  Restaurant and bar patrons and employees will no longer be exposed to the dangers of secondhand smoke.  I want to thank Rep. Holliman for all his hard work in this important step forward for our state and its future," said Purcell.

> Gov. Perdue Orders Highway Patrol to Implement New Travel Records Protocol

Gov. Perdue this week ordered the Department of Crime Control and Public Safety and the State Highway Patrol to implement new travel record keeping protocols for security details assigned to both the governor and lieutenant governor.

> “I’ve pledged to run an open and transparent administration,” said Gov. Perdue.  “This new protocol will provide clear direction for how the State Highway Patrol executive security detail collects and retains travel records.”

> The new travel record form will include detailed information about each trip outside of Wake County taken by the governor or lieutenant governor when a member of the executive security detail provides protection.

> “Governor Perdue has made it clear that her entire administration should operate with the highest standards of openness, and that’s exactly what we intend to do,” said CCPS Secretary Reuben Young.

> All records will be maintained by the State Highway Patrol for four years after the governor or lieutenant governor’s term, at which point they will be transferred to state archives.

I would like to thank you for this message. IT was very unhelpful, did not answer my question, and I will probably never get an answer to my question. Also that smoking ban article is stupid. If you are around second hand smoke enough to develop a problem, then you are probably around it more then being in a restaurant. Im still waiting for my email. Its been about 4 days. Thanks Rebeca Perrell

Dear Friends,
On this Memorial Day, please join me in remembering all those who have died for our country, so that we may be free.
In North Carolina, we understand military service and sacrifice.  Thousands of veterans, active duty, and reserves live in this state.  They are our families, our friends, and our neighbors.  We thank them for this service and we thank their families.
I'll be at the National Cemetery in New Bern for a Memorial Day Service, I ask you to take time today to reflect on these patriots who have died for America.
Happy Memorial Day and God Bless America!

Thank you for your greetings.  Would you please answer my earlier-much earlier-email about the tax free holiday weekend.  You are cutting salaries, furloughing employees, RIF'ing employees.  It is reckless, irresponsible and unethical to voluntarily give up $5 million in sales tax revenue.  I do not know who is advising you, but you are not being well served by them.

Sincerely,

Dear Governor Perdue,  some time ago I sent your office a e-mail concerning double standard laws dealing with car window tinting, the problem is between the stores selling the tint legally but technically illegally when it comes down to getting your car inspected and professional tinting businesses that know that its illegal when it becomes time for an inspection, so you got a common denominator that everyone is making money except for you in the end you lose, this is not fair to the public people and they are getting robbed, please look into this A.S.A.P, thank you and GOD BLESS, Retired military Virgil Hardin.

	<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/>


Gov. Perdue Announces Plan to Create Green Jobs

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx>Governor Bev Perdue this week announced her energy reform package to attract businesses, create jobs and promote a strong and sustainable green economy in North Carolina. She made the announcement at the SAS Solar Farm in Cary, which provides solar-generated power to Progress Energy.
“Developing our green economy is a cornerstone of my vision for North Carolina’s economic future,” Gov. Perdue said. “Creating green jobs and businesses is a key part of my JobsNOW initiative, and the energy reforms I am implementing will lay the foundation for North Carolina to lead the nation in green energy.”
Gov. Perdue’s energy plan refocuses state energy policymaking, makes strategic investments in North Carolina’s green economy and increases green-collar workforce development.
“The state that gets green right will own the next 50 years,” Gov. Perdue said. “I intend for North Carolina to be that state.”
Governor Perdue’s energy plan includes:
- Relocating the State Energy Office and state weatherization program to the Department of Commerce
- Reinvigorating the Energy Policy Council
- Establishing an Energy Investment Revolving Loan Fund
- Expanding the Green Business Fund
- Growing North Carolina’s green workforce
- Investing federal recovery monies for other energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in small businesses, communities and homes across North Carolina

Governor Perdue Launches JobsNOW Portal

Gov. Bev Perdue today launched the <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW Portal, a user-friendly resource for job seekers, those exploring new career options, and entrepreneurs looking to start, grow or relocate a business in North Carolina.
<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx>“JobsNOW will help get our economy back on track and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future,” said Gov. Perdue.  “The JobsNOW Portal will be a valuable tool for job seekers and businesses looking to expand or relocate.”
The JobsNOW Portal is part of Governor Perdue’s JobsNOW initiative, which brings together state agencies, local governments, business leaders and citizens to create new jobs, put people back to work and train and retrain our workers for success. 
Other JobsNOW initiatives include Perdue’s recently announced Green Energy Plan, the “12 in 6” Worker Training Program, the Charlotte Area Workforce Recovery Plan and the N.C. Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.
Gov. Perdue Signs Legislation Prohibiting Smoking in Bars and Restaurant

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday signed House Bill 2, which prohibits smoking in public bars and restaurants. Rep. Hugh Holliman and Sen. Bill Purcell led the efforts to pass this landmark legislation. The smoking ban will go into effect on Jan. 2, 2010, and will be enforced by local health directors.
“This is a historic day for North Carolina,” said Gov. Perdue. “But more important than the history that we are making is the positive impact we are having on public health. By banning smoking in our restaurants and bars, we will greatly reduce the dangers of secondhand smoke and lower health care costs for families.”
According to a report by the United States Surgeon General, secondhand smoke causes the death of approximately 50,000 citizens a year. In addition, a study prepared by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina found that exposure to secondhand smoke costs North Carolinians $289 million annually.
"I am extremely happy with this legislation becoming a reality. This is a gigantic step in improving the public health for the citizens of our great state, and I'm glad I was able to play a part in making this bill a law," said Holliman.
"This new law is a significant step for public health in North Carolina.  Restaurant and bar patrons and employees will no longer be exposed to the dangers of secondhand smoke.  I want to thank Rep. Holliman for all his hard work in this important step forward for our state and its future," said Purcell.
Gov. Perdue Orders Highway Patrol to Implement New Travel Records Protocol

Gov. Perdue this week ordered the Department of Crime Control and Public Safety and the State Highway Patrol to implement new travel record keeping protocols for security details assigned to both the governor and lieutenant governor.
“I’ve pledged to run an open and transparent administration,” said Gov. Perdue.  “This new protocol will provide clear direction for how the State Highway Patrol executive security detail collects and retains travel records.”
The new travel record form will include detailed information about each trip outside of Wake County taken by the governor or lieutenant governor when a member of the executive security detail provides protection.
“Governor Perdue has made it clear that her entire administration should operate with the highest standards of openness, and that’s exactly what we intend to do,” said CCPS Secretary Reuben Young.
All records will be maintained by the State Highway Patrol for four years after the governor or lieutenant governor’s term, at which point they will be transferred to state archives.
McDowell County Manufacturers Create Jobs

Baldor Electric Co. to Expand in Marion and Add 25 Jobs
Baldor Electric Co., an international supplier of industrial electric motors, mechanical power transmission products, drives and generators, will expand its Marion operations.  The <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx>company plans to invest $3.1 million and create 25 jobs during the next three years. The announcement was made possible in part by a $75,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
“North Carolina continues to support a strong manufacturing sector offering new job opportunities,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Our state is attractive to growing companies like Baldor that know the value of our top business climate and skilled workforce.”
Baldor is consolidating operations by moving a large mounted roller-bearing line from Indiana to its Marion plant, adding 25 positions to the nearly 100 employees already at the facility.
For more information about Baldor Electric Co., including employment opportunities, visit <http://www.baldor.com/>www.baldor.com.

Morganton Pressure Vessels to Create 43 Jobs
Morganton Pressure Vessels LLC, a manufacturer of air pressure vessels and oil separators, filters and containers for absorption dryers, is <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx>expanding in McDowell County.  During the next three years, the company plans to create 43 jobs and invest $2 million, including lease payments.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $129,000 One North Carolina Fund grant.
“North Carolina supports growth and new opportunities in our manufacturing sector,” said Gov. Perdue.  “Our state continues to see companies expand because of our excellent business climate, our highly-skilled workforce, and exceptional quality of life.”

> Preparing for Hurricane Season

Hurricane Season begins on Monday and ends on Nov. 30.  North Carolina will be ready in the event of a tropical storm or hurricane.  In addition to encouraging North Carolina's families to prepare, Gov. Perdue is working to ensure that the state is prepared to respond to a disaster.  On Thursday, Gov. Perdue, cabinet officials and state emergency management officials conducted a simulation exercise, rehearsing the roles and responsibilities of each agency during a disaster. 

> In addition, Gov. Perdue proclaimed this week "Hurricane Preparedness Week."  This year marks the 10th anniversary of the state’s costliest and most destructive storm.  On Sept. 16, 1999, Hurricane Floyd struck our state leaving behind 52 deaths and $6 billion in damages. 

> “In North Carolina we understand from experience the power and destruction of hurricanes.  With hurricane season approaching, I ask us all to be prepared,” said Gov. Perdue.  “I urge all families, businesses and local governments to check your emergency plans and emergency kits before any disaster strikes.” 

> North Carolina ranks second only to Florida in vulnerability to hurricanes. Citizens are urged to assemble emergency supply kits, then make and rehearse plans for where to go and what to do if a hurricane threatens the state.

> Citizens are also encouraged to review and update their homeowners’ insurance policies to make sure they include coverage for accidental damage and natural disasters and, if necessary, flood insurance.

> Families should have an emergency plan and emergency supplies kit ready to go at all times.  The kit should contain enough non-perishable food and a gallon of water per person per day to last three to seven days.  The kit should also include the following essentials:

> ·         Copies of insurance papers and identification sealed in a watertight plastic bag

> ·         First-aid kit

> ·         Weather radio and batteries

> ·         Supply of prescription medicines

> ·         Bedding

> ·         Changes of clothes

> ·         Hygiene items such as toothbrush, toothpaste, soap and deodorant

> ·         Cash or checkbook

> ·         Pet supplies including food, water, leashes, bedding, muzzle and vaccination records

> People should stay informed during a storm by keeping a battery-powered radio for weather and evacuation information and should know evacuation routes in their community.  They also need to heed the warnings of state and local officials and evacuate quickly when told to do so.

> Citizens can evacuate their homes with small, domestic pets to specially designated pet-friendly shelters.  Pet shelters will be equipped with pet crates, but people should bring feeding dishes, food and water, immunization papers and other pet supplies.

> For more information on how to prepare for any type of emergency, visit <http://www.ReadyNC.org>www.ReadyNC.org. 

> Gov. Perdue Announces $62 Million in Crime Prevention Grants

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced the awarding of $62 million in grants to state and local agencies to improve community safety and assist crime victims. 

> After reviewing more than 520 grant applications, the Governor’s Crime Commission (GCC) made awards for 315 programs in 86 counties, five universities and six state agencies. The money will help efforts to stop gangs, fight juvenile delinquency, assist victims of domestic violence and provide updated equipment for law enforcement agencies.

> “These grants are making a real difference in reducing crime and protecting our citizens,” Gov. Perdue said.  “We want to keep our people safe, help those who have been victimized and provide law enforcement with the additional resources to get the job done.”

> <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=440>> To see a list of the 315 grants, please see the attached document here.

> Contracts Awarded to 17 Additional Transportation Recovery Projects

Contracts have been awarded for 17 additional highway projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The contracts total $102.8 million and were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.

> “These projects will help create and sustain thousands of jobs and provide needed economic development in counties throughout North Carolina,” said Gov. Perdue. “They will improve critical routes to help better connect North Carolinians around the state.”

> The projects are in Alamance, Alexander, Anson, Buncombe, Burke, Cabarrus, Cherokee, Cleveland, Cumberland, Durham, Gaston, Guilford, Iredell, Johnston, Mecklenburg, Nash, Rockingham, Surry, Union, Wake and Yadkin counties. Two resurfacing projects, one on U.S. 64 in Nash/Edgecombe counties and one on I-440 in Wake County, will be awarded if the low bidder demonstrates that it has met “good faith effort” requirements in attempting to reach the disadvantaged business enterprise goals set forth in the contracts.

> <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=424>> For a list of the projects, see the attached documents here.

> The bids received on all 17 economic recovery projects came in nearly 25 percent, about $36.7 million, below NCDOT estimates. Work on all contracts will start in late June or early July.

> The transportation projects announced to date are expected to help create and sustain more than 20,000 jobs and generate more than $4 billion in economic development.

> In addition to helping create jobs, the 17 projects awarded will complete needed infrastructure improvements. Fifteen of the projects entail resurfacing or rehabilitation of major routes across the state. One project will complete grading work for a stretch of the Fayetteville Outer Loop, and another is for a bridge replacement.

> For more information about recovery funding for infrastructure improvements in North Carolina, as well as other NCDOT projects and activities, visit <http://www.ncdot.gov>www.ncdot.gov.

> New National Guard Joint Force Headquarters

On Tuesday, Gov. Bev Perdue, Congressman David Price and Major General William Ingram broke ground on the new National Guard Joint Force Headquarters in Raleigh. The building will also house offices for the State Highway Patrol, Division of Emergency Management and Department of Transportation. The joint operation will ease cooperation during emergency situations. 

> Construction of the 237,000 sq. ft. facility will create over 4,000 jobs, and $41.5 million of the $56 million projected cost will come from federal recovery funds.

> First Gentleman Eaves Donates Books to Halifax and Rutherford County Elementary Schools

First Gentleman Bob Eaves donated 500 summer reading books through the Scholastic Summer Challenge to Inborden Elementary School in Halifax County and to Harris Elementary School in Rutherford County.  The Scholastic Summer Challenge is a national literacy campaign that raises awareness of the importance of summer reading among children, families, teachers and librarians.

> “Summer is a time for students to relax and prepare for the upcoming school year.  With that preparation comes the important task of keeping up with and improving on their reading skills,” Mr. Eaves said.  “I want all children to have fun while reading this summer, and I hope they enjoy these new books during the summer.”

> Harris Elementary School is located across the street from the birth place of Mr. Eaves’ father.  Mr. Eaves also wanted to donate to Halifax County in support of the current challenges the school district is correcting.

> Mr. Eaves is one of more than 30 first spouses who are participating in the challenge.

> The State Library of North Carolina also has a Summer Reading Program, which encouraged 136,000 individual North Carolina children and teens to register at their local libraries for the program in 2008.

> The state library is part of the Collaborative Summer Library Programs, a grassroots organization of states committed to delivering high-quality summer reading programs to its children at the lowest cost possible for its public libraries.  For more information, please contact Lori Special, youth services consultant for the State Library of North Carolina, at 919-807-7425. 

> Global Manufacturer to Expand in Eden, Relocate Headquarters to Cary

Loparex LLC, a global manufacturer of polycoated and silicone-coated papers and films, will expand its manufacturing operation in Eden and relocate its U.S. headquarters from a Chicago suburb to Cary. The company plans to invest $18.9 million and create 128 jobs -- 68 in Eden and 60 in Cary -- during the next three-and-a-half years.

> “This project demonstrates clearly the unique qualities that make North Carolina a top choice for global companies looking to invest and expand,” Gov. Perdue said. “We are able to provide a well-trained workforce with experience in advanced manufacturing - still a very important part of our economy - as well as top scientific talent for research and development collaboration, resulting in 128 well-paying, sustainable jobs.”

> Under terms of the performance-based grant, the average annual wage of the Eden jobs will be $52,323, not including benefits, significantly greater than the Rockingham County average of $29,796. The average annual wage for jobs in Cary will be $93,347, not including benefits, more than twice the Wake County average wage of $43,160.

> Loparex currently has 92 employees in North Carolina, all at its Rockingham county manufacturing facility. Of the $18.9 million planned investment, $16.9 million will go to the Rockingham County expansion; $2 million will go to Wake County for the new headquarters.

> For more information about Loparex, visit <http://www.loparex.com>www.loparex.com.

Well, what happens after you "catalogue" my suggestion?  

My email was sent to convey to Governor Perdue my thoughts and position on important issues and actions concerning public school education.  How and where should I send that information so that it is communicated to her and her advisors rather than being stamped and catalogued?!!

Thank you for submitting your comments to Governor Perdueâ€™s suggestion box. We appreciate public input and hope you will continue to engage with us. Because we receive so many suggestions we are not able to reply to every one. Be assured, however, that all suggestions are important and are read and catalogued. Only working together can we move North Carolina forward.

Governor Perdue,

In my opinion, a response is required.  Please don't forget, republocrat and demican are two wings of the same bird.  We all know that.  The anti-republocrat votes will disappear if your character proves flawed, by additionally taxing the minuscule citizenry.

Sincerely,

It's been months now since I asked a question about the children housed at Butner, and I asked the question three times before even getting an automated response saying the question would be answered as quickly as possible.  Very disappointing.  I really think the part of the governor's site where citizens can ask questions should be removed if this is the best that can be done.

>Gov. Perdue Launches Find-a-Book Summer Reading Program
>
>
>Gov. Perdue today launched the Find-a-Book Summer Reading Program at Wrightsboro Elementary School in Wilmington to promote the retention and growth of student reading skills during the summer break. Studies show that students who don't read during the summer vacation are more likely to lag behind their peers' reading level when they return to school in the fall.
>
>"The summer is a time for fun, family and a break from school - but learning is something we should do 365 days a year, seven days a week," said Gov. Perdue. "Through the Find-a-Book Summer Reading Program, we can encourage our kids have a good book in their hands even when they're away from the classroom. And we can make sure students continue to learn - and learn to love reading."
>
>Perdue read to a third grade class and talked to them about the importance and joy or reading. She demonstrated the new Find-a-Book Web site, www.lexile.com/findabook<http://www.lexile.com/findabook>, to parents, students and school staff. The Find-a-Book web site contains a searchable database that matches a book's text difficulty to a student's reading ability through a Lexile reading measure. In North Carolina, students in grades 3-8, as well as high school students taking the English I state assessment, will receive a Lexile measure in their end-of-year test results. Lexile is the most widely adopted reading measure in use today.
>
>Perdue urged school faculty to promote the summer reading program to parents, while encouraging community members to become involved in the summer reading program as volunteers and mentors. The governor has sent letters and informational fliers to principals and librarians. Parents will receive letters and information on the summer reading initiative with their child's end-of-year report card.
>
>Public libraries across the state are also participating in the Find-a-Book Summer Reading Program. Library staff can assist parents and students with the Find-a-Book Web site and Lexile reading measures.

>
>"These numbers are yet another indicator that the Tar Heel state is becoming a very significant player in the global military and defense industry cluster," said Gov. Perdue.  "The time to capitalize on this trend is now, to leverage expanding markets, capture federal revenues and grow jobs right here in North Carolina - the most military friendly state in America."
>
>Gov. Perdue was instrumental, with the General Assembly, in establishing the NCMBC in the Community College System and the Defense and Security Technology Accelerator (DSTA) in Fayetteville.  She also spearheaded the development of the North Carolina Military Foundation, a private organization focused on recruiting defense contractors and growing the state's defense and homeland security economy.
>
>According to a 2008 Department of Commerce study, the military has a $23.4 billion total annual impact on the state economy.  Defense procurement in North Carolina, based on place of performance, increased from $2.9 billion in federal fiscal year 2007 to $3.6 billion in 2008.  During the same time frame, spending by all federal agencies in North Carolina increased approximately $743 million, or 16 percent, from $4.5 billion to $5.2 billion.

Please do not send me anymore articles that I can read in the newspaper.  Stick to the subject that I inquired about---if you have an answer.  If our state is continued to be taken advantage of by those in your position--the upcoming generation won't have the education to work for Apple.
