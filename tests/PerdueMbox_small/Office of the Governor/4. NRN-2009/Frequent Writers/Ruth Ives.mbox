Essay #1 Identity: Self-Identity



[O God come to my assistance, O Lord make haste to help me.

O Lord hear my prayer. And let my cry come unto Thee.]



Notwithstanding that it is probably not technically the best way to begin an essay, I am going to start with a quotation about self-identity.



ìOut of the squalid yearnings of my flesh bubbled up the clouds and scum of puberty . . .

so that I could not tell the serenity of love from the swamp of lust.î

Quotation from St. Augustine of Hippo, Confessions (c. AD 400)



What Ms. Davis and the Anonymous Haitian girl do not understand is that there are spiritual forces and causes at work that are agitating the evil, the conflicts, the strife, the chaos, the confusion, the violence, the war, the troubles, the tribulations, the suffering,

The pain, the sorrow, the woes, the calamities, the catastrophist, the disasters, the anger, the resentment, the jealousy, the greed, the avarice, the lust, the lasciviousness, the envy, the lechery, the licentiousness, and the concupiscence which are at the root causes of racism and slavery, the crime, the agitator of all of these human ills is one entity which Ms. Davis and the Anonymous Haitian girl do not know about and therefore do not mention, the Devil. They donít mention the Devil because they dismiss the idea as absurd and ridiculous. But Devil knows who he is, he knows his identity, and he knew who Ms. Anonymous was, and he knew who Ms. Davis is, and he knows, and it has been my experience that he knew my identity before I did. He knew who I would be, or who I might become.



ìThe purpose of both witches and wizards .. is none other but that infamous intercourseÖ conncexion with the Demon.î

L.M. Sinistrari, Demoniality (1709)





They donít believe in the Devil. I do. I believe that the Devil is a creature motivated by all consuming hatred of all mankind, regardless of gender, nationality, race, color, hair texture, foot-size, nose-size, or ancestry. The Devil in the past, the present and the future does not change. Both of these readings and the interviewer herself do not know or realize that they are all talking about the same thing, the same being they are in agreement yet they believe that they are in opposition, and contrary. The entity that they are talking about in all its aspects is concentrated evil which causes them their deepest and most primitive terrors. He is an entity that does not care about the color or lack of color in their complexions except as it serves his purpose for agitating hatred, agitating jealousy, agitating envy, agitating lust, agitating concupiscence, agitating wickedness, agitating gluttony, agitating sickness and disease, agitating cruelty, agitating greed, agitating avarice and all of the other causes and effects of human suffering and anxiety and anguish, and depression. Both of these women are speaking of the works of the devil, and what he does against humanity. Listen up ìThe Devil doesnít do good work.î He is an entity that does not care about the largeness or smallness of our noses, or the slantedness or roundness of our eyes, or the shortness or tallness of us, or fullness or thinness of our lips, nor the thickness of our accent or the clarity of our speech. What both women are speaking of are principles, universal principles of morality and ethics. And every word that Ms. Davis, and the Anonymous Haitian girl say resonates with my feelings exactly. The only difference is the means of absolving and resolving the conflicts and disputes. To absolve and resolve these human identity problems The Devil is the ìboogy-manî and he wants you. Beware, be warned, be watchful because my identity as far as the Devil i s concerned is prey. The Devil demon of my childhood nightmares and fears and he is out to get m, he is smiling and licking his chops and wagging his tail, he is relentless and he never forgets his purpose though he may seem to desist temporarily. The Devil is out to ruin my marriage, he is out to ruin our career, he is out to ruin my ordination, he is out to drench my dreams, and dash my hopes, he is out to ruin my physical health and your mental heal and shorten your life. I speak from the voice of experience of the devastations of the works of the Devil upon my identity, upon my personality, and upon my soul. The Devil is no gentleman. And what Ms. Davis and Ms. Anonymous and what I did not know for a long time was that the Devil wants to ìbite off of usî. But my disbelief prevented me for a long time from believing this. I would say, ìBut wait a minute Mr. Devil, you already have a lot, you already have a lot of people, you already have a lot of things. How mu ch is enough? And the Devil might answer, ìJust a little more. Just a few more souls a few more souls. And so, then the first of the spiritual works of Divine Mercy is to admonish the sinner regarding and concerning the Devil. Dr. James Dobson of ìFocus on the Familyî fame, would do well to suggest that we ìFocus on the Devilî for he is the enemy of humanity no matter who no matter where.



Another part of my identity happened when a minister said these words and utterances, ìMy dear sister, upon the confession of your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, I do indeed baptize thee in the name of Jesus for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.î



ìOther systems of classification are conceived of acted .. . Totemism is lived . . it attaches to real groups and real beings.î

Claude Levi-Strauss, Totemism (1962)



I am going to use lots of quotations, because I donít think that I am very smart and because I think that the people that I am quoting from are smarter than I am and I am a fan of some of the luminaries whose sacred writing I am quoting from, and because I really do believe that humanity definitely stands on the shoulders of the people, our ancestors, our common ancestors and the people who have gone before us. It would be a travesty not to acknowledge that reality.



ìMan is born for uprightness. If he lose it and yet live, it is merely luck.î Confucius, Analects (c. 440 BC).



And so another question that must be asked besides ìWho am I?î is Who am I in relation to the Devil?



The Opening



The US Justice Department hated Martin Luther King, Jr. Director J. Edgar Hoover hated Martin Luther King, Jr. and hated the Civil Rights Movement, and hated the Black Power Movement and the Black Cultural Movement, and the Anti Viet Nam War movement. And so, every one who was involved in even a cursory or peripheral way was on the directorís ìhit listî as ìsubversivesî. Doesnít it seem odd that the US Justice Department would hate people because they were seeking Justice, and redress of their grievances by peaceful and non-violent means. It really is a mystery and there are no clues.



ìWhile science is based on the conception of natural forces, magic springs from the idea of a certain mystic, impersonal power ... called manna by some Melanesians . . . a well-nigh universal idea wherever magic flourishesî

Bronislaw Malinowski, Magic, Science & Religion and Other Essays (1948)



I opened with that statement because of all the things, in all the world that has shaped my life oratory, rhetoric, words and utterances have been the most influential and affective and permanent in the process of shaping my identity.



ìNobility, wealth, rank .. . What have you done to deserve so many advantages? You have given yourself the trouble of being born, nothing more!î

Pierre-Augustine de Beaumarchais, The Marriage of Figaro (1781)





But in the beginning it was as if I was living in the Garden of Eden. In this ìGarden of Edenî there was plenty of everything, there was prosperity and acceptance, and security, and warmth, and health, and happiness, and ìgoodness and mercyî followed you all the days of your life. (From the 23rd Psalm). I had the good life. I had plenty of great friends. I was part of communion of people, because I had been duly initiated into the communion. Once initiated I was fully and entirely accepted with all good standing an privileges prevailing.



ìYou believe in the God who plays dice, and I in complete law and order in a world which objectively exists, and which I, in a wildly speculative way, am trying to capture .î .

Albert Einstein, letter to Max Born (1944)



The first utterances that shaped my identity officially were: ìItís a girl!î. No matter in what language these words are spoken in, no matter where in the world, they signify and have one meaning and on meaning only. This is a female child. These were the very first words and utterances that were spoken about me when I first entered this world of air-breathing, warm-blooded mammals in the United States of America .



ì . . . of comfort no man speak: Letís talk of graves, of worms and epitaphs Öî



William Shakespeare, Richard II (1597)



I was born in the 1940ís America , which was about 80 years after the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation, which was a document that actually shaped and determined my identity before I was even born. The words of this document, Signed by President Abraham Lincoln, signified and had the meaning that due to circumstances under his power and control, I would not be born into slavery because of my complexion, that the institution of slavery had been dissolved. Doesnít that just make chills run up and down your spine? Isnít that just the most exciting thing? That your identity is actually shaped by what is legal and what is not, and what is legal and what is not legal is determined by documents, words and utterances officially and permanently.

And so, one part of my self-identity is that I am emancipated.



ìSome men are by nature slaves and others by nature free. And it is just . . and fitting that one man should be master and another obey, for the quality of superiority is also inherent in the natural masterî



Quotation of John Mair, justifying enslavement of American Indians (1513)





When I read the monologue of the young Haitian girl. I both empathized and sympathized with her situation. I actually think that what she is saying is ìpsycho babbleî. Haiti was liberated from the domination of the French. And Haiti is a very small Nation of mostly Black folks. But I do not agree with the girl that this ìfeedingî on various aspects of appearance goes only on way. Because she is very young she just is unable to perceive the subtle ways in which the other cultures also ìdeedî or ìbit off ofî her culture. In fate the interviewer, who is possibly not Haitian is at that very moment ìfeedingî on here, for inspiration, imagination, ideas, feeding on her time, feeding off of her energy, and feeding off of her youth, and feeding off of her words. So, the girl is just very immature and doesnít realize her own self worth and value in the situation at the school. She does not recognize the fact that the girl s of the girls of the non-Haitian nationality would not be there at her school if they were not getting something out of it, and feeding on the situation in some way, and receiving something from being there at the same school with her. She is just immature and does not understand the spirituality of the situation. They are feeding on her spirituality even if not copying or imitating her hairstyle or her clothing styles. See?



ìA social instinct is implanted in all men by Nature and yet who first founded the city was the greatest of benefactors.î
Aristotle, Politics (4th century BC)



Looking at this situation as a more mature person and not as a child. That is how I relate to such a situation, mutual benefit. These children are benefiting mutually from their situation. And, the reason for the difference in the way she relates to the situation and the way I relate to the situation is obviously because the girl is only fourteen years old and I am sixty one year old. The girl is not independent of her parents, peers, or teachers and so they are still shaping her ways of thinking and feeling, and shaping her choices, and goals, and ways of dressing and behaving and talking. These are complex behavior patterns, and complex psychological factors at work developmentally. But suffice to say, that all of the girls have in common that they are welcomed into the same institution regardless of the differences in the complexions.



As a student in the Pan African Studies department at Cal State Los Angeles I made friends with other students and on several occasions when they came to my home and noticed that my interior decorating included replicas of paintings by Da Vinci and Rembrant. They asked me. ìWhy do you have these pictures of white people on your walls? ì Well, I didnít have an answer. I did not know what to say. I actually thought that my home furnishings and art were beautifully made. But what my fellow students were saying is that from their point of view, my identity was that of a despised class know as the ìbourgeoisieî and worse than that ìanglophileî, but mostly they were appalled and quickly labeled me as ìbourgeoisieî. I never saw them, they cooled toward me, because in their minds the glamorous home furnishings, paintings and art was an ill omen. I was imperfect and God forbid that anyone should be imperfect. I was ìbiting off& #8221; from Anglo culture, and not having anything to do with other cultures, African or Asian, of Hispanic, or Native. I had not noticed that my furnishings and decorations and art in my home had no multicultural diversity at all. After those situations, I began to immerse myself in multicultural art, music, food, and drink, costume, dance, hair styles, and jewelry. They just kept me jumping back and forth through this hoop and that hoop and nothing that I did was quite pleasing enough. They were never satisfied. There was always something else that had to be corrected about my identity. Ergo, the identity battles i.e. who you are going to be in relation to us.



ìLíEtat, cíest moi

[I am the state]î

Louis XVI (1638-1715)



In thinking more about my self identity and how it was shaped, it occurs to me now that perhaps I should decide which of my identities I wish to explore. Do I wish to explore my childhood identity? Do I wish to explore my adolescent self identity? Do I wish to explore my young adult college student identity? Do I wish to explore my middle-aged self? Do I wish to explore my mature ìgolden oldiesî self? Unlike my classmates, who are in their late teens and early twenties, possibly never married and no children, possibly still living at home with their parents, I am 61 years of age. And a grand mother. That sets us apart in many ways. It alienates us in many ways. And I confess that when it comes to identity I try to define myself complex ways.



ìA manís free will serves only to lead him into sin, if the way of truth be hidden from him.î St. Augustine , Confessions(c. AD 400)



I have had some real legal battles over my self identity. I have had battles with the protestant and the Catholic church and the priesthood, and the parish lay persons regarding my identity. They say one thing. And I say, no I canít agree with that. They say that women cannot be ordained.



ìListen to my words. I speak to you. I tell you that I am the son of Ra who issued from his own body. I sit upon his throne rejoicing. For he made me king.î

Pharaoh tomb inscription (c. 2465-2325 BC)





Well, of course that is true, women canít be ordained if your point of reference is an institution that has a two thousand year line of unbroken male priest from St. Peter to the present in which all of the priests are men. Some women who wanted to be ordained chose to challenge this rule. That is a fight that you are not going to win. The Roman Pontiff has already said, in his words and utterances and written words that he is not even thinking about ordaining women. I didnít waste time trying to force my opinion on the Pope. I simply found a religious order, and educational institution that was willing to ordain anyone, without regard for their complexion or their gender. They provided me with a universal ordination which is recognized by state law.



And so, part of my identity is that I am an officially ordained minister, and doctor of the church, a Cardinal and a Bishop.



ìThose who believe with the Prophet strive with their wealth and lives. Allah hath made ready for them gardens where rivers flow . . . That is the supreme triumph.î

Quran, 9:88-9 (7th Century AD).



Another part of my identity is when I discovered that I actually had a choice in the matter of who I was going to be, what my identity would be. Now, I consciously choose and pick and select the things that I am going to allow to shape my identity and my self-hood.

Rather than leaving it up to ìdumb luckî as I used to do. Once this awareness came to me that I can define myself, and that it really wasnít my complexion that defined me or limited me or gave me my identity, that my self-hood came from within, from the Holy Spirit. Through the sacraments I made this discovery.



ìWhat is divinely taught to us by faith cannot be contrary to what we learn by nature . . . since we have both from God. He would be the cause of our error, which is impossible.î

St. Thomas Aquinas, Light of Faith (13th century)



There are seven Catholic Sacraments and I have all of them. That is another part of my identity, and another institution in my life. All of my identity traits seem to have institutions behind them it seems to me. Father Francis Colburn, was the pastor at St. Andrew Catholic church and one afternoon in June he gave me the affirmation and through his official words and utterances and my agreement and promise and acceptance I became a traditional Roman Catholic. The Seven Sacraments are Sacrament of Baptism, Sacrament of Confirmation, Communion, Sacrament of the Sick, Sacrament of Reconciliation and Penance, Sacrament of Ordination, Sacrament of Marriage, Sacrament of the Eucharist. And each of these sacraments has official words and utterances rites and rituals that shaped my identity, my spirituality together.



ìYet it does move.î

Galileo Galilei, after being forced by the Inquisition to recant his theory of a heliocentric universe (1632)



In conclusion, it is these words, utterances, rites and rituals of the church that have given me identity, spirituality, shaped my identity, which is ever changing-ever new, that have been the anchor of my soul of my spirit and the moral compass that guides me upon the seas of life whether the seas of life be calm or rough, these have been general peace of mind and in times of anxiety, anguish, or distress have been a steadfast and sure hope of the grace of God and assurance of Salvation to me. That has been my experience. I confess that I do not know how these sacraments work, or why they work.



In the history of race relations in the United States Ms. Davis was one of the people that the Justice Department persecuted because the culture at time was not in the mood for any change in race relations. But I do believe that something has changed. And the something is the spirituality of the nation. I cannot explain exactly what that means. I cannot explain exactly how that works, but it seems that this spirituality is now shaping identity of individuals and shaping the identity of country as a whole. And I am very glad about this and at the same time at deeper levels of consciousness terrified.



ìWe gave you the Sharia in religion, so follow it and do not follow the passions of those who do not know.î

Qauran (7th century AD)



I am at a deeper level of consciousness terrified because of my own unpredictability even though I am for the most part rather predictable and there is a sameness about me that is part of my identity. There is a sameness about my behavior, and a sameness my habits, but these are not inflexible. I still have free will. And sometimes freewill in oneís self and others can be terrifying. You think that you know what you might do, but you donít really know. You think that you know who you are but you could turn into somebody else. Which brings me to another part of my identity that I am not particularly proud of.

Communion wine gives me the crazies. I was telling this to the church organist. And so, I prefer to have grape juice. I can tell the difference in my behavior and my attitude after the mass when I have participated in the Eucharistic Sacrament. It is terrifying because of the realization of vulnerability and mortality, and morbidity. Which is a startling revelation for sure, that at one time or another part of my identity is altruism, the need to give a helping hand to someone along the way at times, not day in and day out, but sometimes and also that I need a helping from friends, family, community, co workers, people sometimes.



Which brings me to a final idealistic and altruistic notion of my identity. Who do I think that I should be, even if I am not that all of the time?



A Good Samaritan. That is terrifying because sometimes being a Good Samaritan makes one vulnerable.



ìI solemnly pledge myself to consecrate my life to the service of humanity.

I will give my teachers the respect and gratitude which is their due:

I will practice my profession with conscience and dignity;

The health of my patient will be my first consideration;

I will respect the secrets which are confided in me;

I will maintain by all means in my power the honor and the noble traditions of the medical profession; my colleagues will be my brothers;

I will not permit considerations of religion, nationality, race, party politics, or social standing to intervene between my duty and my patient;

I will maintain the utmost respect for human life, from the time of conception;

Even under threat, I will not use my medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity.

I will make these promises solemnly, freely, and upon my honor.

--The Declaration of Geneva (based on the Hippocratic Oath)



And so, I think that this is a good place to stop and ponder and reflect upon my identity what it was, what it is, what it could be and what it shall be.

The Kingdom of God concept is incompatible with the Bill of Rights. And so, what seems to be the case with each of these Kingdoms is that people are regularly indoctrinated, and brainwashed about building the Kingdom. And Their indoctrination, and brainwashing license them to go out the do things to build the Kingdom of God. And so, the indoctrinated, brainwashed, masses, and oligarchy, make pacts the foreign Devil, and made compacts with the foreign and concordats with the foreign Devil in the manner of Faust. Because they believe that they are licensed to do anything to build the Kingdom of God in the United States of America. Including murder an old cook at a fraternity house on USC Fraternity Row in 1983. She was murdered at the Fraternity house, not at the hospital, she was already dead when she was hooked up to the life support and respirator, but the illusion had to be maintained, and the billing had to take place to pay the feeding frenzy, or else the death would not benefit the Kingdom, blood money, filthy lucre, hush money, be quiet money, be silent money, Don‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell money. Kingdom money. There is no statute of limitations on murder. And not being satisfied with that, they then colluded and conspired to kill off the relatives and extended family of the old cook, one by one in a serial. But first they had to be falsely arrested for the sake of the Kingdom, falsely accused, for the sake of the kingdom, falsely charged for the sake of the Kingdom God‚Äôs Kingdom, falsely imprisoned for the sake of the Kingdom, raped and molested for the sake of the Kingdom. Drugged for the sake of the Kingdom, implicated for the sake of the Kingdom, falsely imprisoned for the sake of the Kingdom. Falsely arraigned for the sake of the Kingdom of God, sterilized for the sake of the Kingdom, or having babies for the Kingdom of God. I mean people can justify anything by saying that they are doing it for the Kingdom of God. Where do you draw the line? Who makes the decisions. On the point of the Statute of Limitations. I believe that I have captured five of the murders of the cook at USC Fraternity house, five of the murders, one immigrant male, possibly Viet Namese, or Cambodian, Korean, Thailandese, South East Asian descendents of the South East Asian Conflict, the Viet Nam War felon, number one. the two Sheriff Deputy Security officers, one male and one females, descendants of migrant workers, descendants of the farm workers movement, descendants of the Ceasar Chaves movement, felons numbers two and three, and two African American Women who were placed as decoys, accessories or accomplices after the fact of the crime felons number four and five. All of these felons and their descendants and progeny to be compensated if they kill or steal, or lie under oath, or falsely testify as false witnesses for the sake of the Kingdom of God, for the sake of God‚Äôs Kingdom. All of these felonious activities supported by that bigot, now seated St. John‚Äôs and his unspeakable crew of priests, lay members, missionaries, evangelists, teachers, and preachers, his underpriests, his nuns, his sisters, his volunteers, his alter workers. Felons and felons, fiends and devils. Actually lie, under oath, lie on the witness stand for the Kingdom of God. The first time I saw this is became indignant and protested right in Judge Lewin‚Äôs courtroom, he had me ejected and never let me back in again, and I had to get my information from Lee his clerk from then on in the Superior Court. We have been under a ban since they murdered my mother, the old cook at the USC Fraternity house. Yes, I blame the Kingdom of God for this downright holocaust. All of my descendants have been under a ban since they murdered my mother at that fraternity house at USC. We are followed and watched and questioned and denied, and insulted, when it was not us who picked this situation, we did not pick and chose to be this situation. They have been killing off people all around us since that time for the sake of the Kingdom of God and implicating us as having some kind of complicity in these serial murders and mass murders. My children have been under a ban since these felons murdered my mother, their grandmother in 1983 and their descendants have been under a ban, and all of our descendants are under a ban because of what they did to us, this oligarchy of bigots and felons. They made enemies of us when they murdered my mother during one of their hate-fests. And so, no I am not a lobbyist for immigration reform for obvious reasons. And if the reasons are not obvious, there is no statute of limitations on murder and I don‚Äôt know which one of them or their descendants murdered my mother, and for the sake of the Kingdom would murder me, or my children or my grand children not thinking that it was a felonious act with consequences, because of our low social status, and their superior looks, and their superior value to society, and their superior motives, and their superior connections. And so what happens is that the descendants of these conflicts are ‚Äúmanaged‚Äù and there is engineering to put them together. In the movie Keys of the Kingdom, Gregory Peck whose character was Father Chiselm was under a ban after the community conspired to kill his father and take over his fishing business accounts. And so, after the community murdered his father, and caused his mother‚Äôs death because she tried to intervene to save him, the deceased‚Äôs son was put under a ban by the community, and was viewed with suspicion, and prejudice, and bigotry and bias, and they actually tried to kill in but a doctor intervened and saved him and went to college and became a priest, but none of his superiors liked him, they were always in a jealous fit about him because he was smarter than his betters, they were always very enemical towards him because they suspected him of wanting to get revenge for the murder of his parents when he came of age, but his destiny was decided when the old Bishop realizing his dilemma realizing that the community would never give up its avarice and greed, and jealousy, and enemical behavior towards the young man, especially since they had all divided a share of his fathers business that they had killed his father to get and stolen away, sent the boy into the foreign mission to China, which was a dangerous situation indeed, but at least he was away from the Catholic community, who had also resented the fact that his Father, a Catholic had married a Protestant woman. There was always a jealous fit going on about that at the rectory, and in the Catholic Community, and the boy was treated with prejudice by the Catholics because his mother was Catholic, they even tried to kill him because of his parents mixed Catholic-Protestant marriage. Yet they saw absolutely nothing wrong with this. They saw absolutely nothing wrong with their evil treatment, their bigotry, their bias, their jealous, their deceit, their depravity. I they were entirely oblivious to the idea that they were in any way doing anything that was un Christian, they were entirely unaware that they were doing anything against the Kingdom of God, or against the Majesty of God. It never occurred to them, they never crossed their minds, that they were doing this against an expressed command by God, Thou Shalt Not Kill, Thou Shalt Not Steal, Thou Shalt not covet and so on. They never suspended their disbelief in the existence of God. And so, I figure what has taken over the Kingdom of God idea. I figure that is what has taken over at West Angeles Church, St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, St. Vincent‚Äô, United University Church, Salvation Army, Episcopal Church, Methodist, Presbyterian, all Kingdom of God, including the Congregational, and Church of Christ, and Baptist, all Kingdom of God. But the Kingdom of God concept is incompatible and irreconcilable with the Bill of Rights, and with the United States Constitution. What I think happens is that these persons who ever they are attempt to make a Kingdom of God out of a church or an apartment building or a government office building, or an office building, and figure up everyone‚Äôs income, property, and personal property values, and how much everyone is worth, and then attempt to include everyone in some kind of scam or confidence game, or fraud or swindle. I think that is exactly what is going on here at the Van Nuys, and the investigation takes such a long time, so that every one can make money and, buy their cars and homes, and pay tuitions, and what ever, and so this means that there is cooperation between the crooks and the people investigating the crime, to their mutual benefit. My Humanities 06 Class is proving to be very revealing. One revelation is that everybody has been indoctrinated in different ways. Their indoctrinations or ‚Äúbrainwashing‚Äù has been done with different kinds of ideas about themselves and other. I think that they go regularly, some of them to ‚Äúbrainwashing‚Äù meetings, or ‚Äúbrainwashing workshops‚Äù. I think that they go regularly to ‚Äúindoctrination‚Äù workshops. I think that is what that man was outside passing out flyers to a Palistinian film meeting about trying to catch some unsuspecting unwary person. But I figure that it was Israeli Intelligence that was in fact running the situation in order to spy out or ferret out people who are pained about the situation in the Gaza strip.I think that the Israelis are trying to run both side of the war in the Gaza strip, not just one side. I think that the Israeli‚Äôs are trying monopolize both sides of the war, and trying to make us think that it is in fact a two-sided war when really it is not. That is what I think. I know what I am supposed to think. I am supposed to believe what I read in the newspaper, believe what I see on television, believe what I read in books. But I don‚Äôt. Both sides are up to no good. Because both sides are one in the same. I knew there was something going on when they to usurp me as I was going to class, an old women, asked me where I bought my outfit, clerical outfit. Then they tried to have me usurped by Palistinian women. I avoided being usurped. Two semesters ago. A Korean women in my Shakespeare II class tried to usurp me. I didn‚Äôt want to be bothered with her either. And so Thursday when I was leaving school, there were more attempts at usurping me. And so, there has been ‚Äúbrainwashing‚Äù and ‚Äúindoctrination‚Äù going on. I am not attempting to rivel the teenagers in classes. I am not attempting to assert that I am younger than I am. I don‚Äôt lie about my age. I am not interested in what Palistinian women do. I am not interested in what Korean women do. I don‚Äôt care actually. I am not interested in what Latin women do. I am just not interested actually at all. I mentioned. Because for some strange reason people are always trying to burden me with the revelation of their filthy little secrets. I don‚Äôt want to know about their nasty little secrets or their filthy little secrets. What they didn‚Äôt say in class is that the tiger will turn on it‚Äôs master and devout it‚Äôs master. The hawk won‚Äôt. The whole thing was psychology, revealing something about Psychological make up of certain ethnic groups. It was a revelation to me that some one thought that they might be jealous of someone of a particular nationality. And so, I figure that they are colluding over the week end about what they are going to say, and what they are not going to say in class, and attempting to do some ‚Äúbrainwashing and ‚Äúindoctrination‚Äù over the next three days before we go back to class. I don‚Äôt hang out with them. I don‚Äôt go to their homes. They don‚Äôt come to my home. I only see them in class. I don‚Äôt party with them. I don‚Äôt drink with them, I don‚Äôt gamble with them. I don‚Äôt eat with them. I don‚Äôt know how they figure that I am going to invade their privacy. What the conflict is to me is the nationalities who feel that they are privileged to be the ‚Äúoverseers‚Äù or even the ‚Äúoverlords‚Äù of other particular nationalities. That is what is very strange to me. I don‚Äôt like being bothered with Iranians, or Palistinians, or Israeli‚Äôs or Turkish, folks because of their bad habit of attempting to usurp. I don‚Äôt like for people to attempt to usurp me, and they will invariably do it. The same with Jews, and other Europeans. And then when I let them know that I am not they can‚Äôt tell me what to do, and I am not theirs to advise or to ‚Äúrailroad, or to entrap,‚Äù they get indignant as if being privileged means that someone has to be bothered with you. when I read the Handmaid‚Äôs Tale, I don‚Äôt know what I am supposed to think. Meaning that the others in the class have been ‚Äúbrainwashed‚Äù or ‚Äúindoctrinated‚Äù to think in a particular way. I am convinced that this class has been usurped. Mr. Waltz says that he thinks that my agenda is different from his. And I suppose it is if his agenda is actual malice, and hate. I don‚Äôt have an agenda actually. I am taking a class as a way of studying Theology. And so, at every church, in the city and county and state there is intelligence and counter intelligence, ‚Äúbrainwashing‚Äù and ‚Äúindoctrination‚Äù. I think that I turned in a real ‚Äúkick but‚Äù performance today. And I think that I turned in a really long essay for Humanities 06. I think that they have been ‚Äúfixing‚Äù scholarships. I think that they have been ‚Äúfixing‚Äù grades. I think that they have been ‚Äúfixing‚Äù grades so that some person doesn‚Äôt get a higher grade than someone else, so that the someone else can look smarter, appear to be smarter, and seem smarter than another person who actually is the smartest. I think that they have been ‚Äúfixing‚Äù grades. I think that they have been ‚Äúfixing‚Äù grants. As far as I know, I have not considered a scholarship, and I have not considered a grant. To do what? I got a $5,000 fellowship, and then I got pregnant, everybody was very upset with me. If you accept the grant or the scholarship, your research or search for truth becomes something usurped. And then they try to get you to become indoctrinated and to indoctrinate others and to become ‚Äúbrainwashed‚Äù and to ‚Äúbrainwash‚Äù others. The Kingdom idea is incompatible with the United States Constitution. The Exorcist Continues Roman Rite of Exorcism Reconciliation and Penance My first visit this morning was with one of the maintenance men in the building to say that I think I dropped a pair of reading glasses down the toilet and that is the reason why, The toilet is running slow. My second visit was to my Humanities Class to turn in my second essay paper. We met in our groups and discussed the current topic Borders and how they are fused together, how cultures adapt to one another, we discussed the old model in which Culture A wipes out Culture B. And how the new model is for culture A and B to accommodate, and adapt to one another and somewhat fuse. There will always be those who do not want the borders to change. I intimated that the Korean women, and the women in my apartment building are always trying to set me up. And that they are always attempting to engineer situations which involved either the elevator or the laundry room to set me up. Always, and these situations are not just cultural, they are mercenary and insurgent activities. This is my contention is that these are mercenary and insurgents, that they gamble on people, like they were cats or dogs, or some other compulsive way that that cultures gamble off of human behavior as if people were cattle or chattel, possibly because that is how they see themselves and so they wish to induct and assimilate everyone into their cultural model. It just isn‚Äôt going go happen that way. Assimilation is not an option where Filippino Culture is concerned or Jewish culture either, because they only have a certain type of positions, all involving subordination, and subjugation, and feudalism, and exploitation, which I deplore and detest. And so then fusion can take place on some levels, but not on all levels, not entirely, and not on the basis of sublimation, deceit, build, subterfuge, or bondage.
