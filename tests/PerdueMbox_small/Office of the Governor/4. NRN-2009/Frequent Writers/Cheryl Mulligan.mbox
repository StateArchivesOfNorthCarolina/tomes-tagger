Around noon on September 16, 2007, ìRaven 23î, a tactical support team of Blackwater Worldwide security guards in Iraq, on contract to the State Department, was responding to an attack on another Blackwater convoy transporting a State Department person. As that convoy evacuated the site of the attack, Raven 23 -- headed back to the Green Zone -- turned around to come to their aid. Because the evacuating team had to pass through Baghdadís Nisour Square to get to the Green Zone, Raven 23 entered the square to set up a roadblock to let the protected passenger convoy pass quickly.
> 
> When Raven 23 entered Nisour Square shooting erupted. And when it ceased fourteen Iraqis were killed and twenty wounded.
> 
> What happened is disputed: did they open fire in response to an attack, or did they open fire without provocation?

> On Tuesday, January 6, five of the eighteen members of Raven 23 will make their first appearance in US District Court in response to their indictment on charges that could result in their imprisonment for up to thirty years.
> 
> The Raven 23 defendants are expected to plead not guilty: they will insist that they were fired upon and only acted in self defense within their mission parameters.
> 
> The government charges the five with voluntary manslaughter, aiding and abetting the killings and with the use of automatic weapons in commission of a crime. But there are problems with the indictments, both legal and factual. And the indictments fairly reek of politics.
> 
> Baghdad in September 2007 was a very dangerous place and Nisour Square wasnít Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. During the week of September 16 -- according to a chart Gen. David Petraeus presented in his Senate testimony on April 8, 2008 -- there were about 790 attacks on Coalition Forces and diplomatic personnel. Thatís about 112 every day, or more than four every hour. Raven 23 -- the eighteen men in four heavily-armored trucks -- knew that the odds were that every time they left the ìGreen Zoneî they were headed into a two-way firefight.
> 
> The first major problem with the indictments is factual. The Blackwater guards -- with the exception of one who plead guilty -- will say they fired only after being fired upon. Which brings up the question of motive.
> 
> These men had nothing to gain by shooting innocents. Their job was to help protect State Department people operating in a war zone. Judging by the overall performance of Blackwater in the years theyíve been protecting State Department, CIA and other US civilians in Iraq -- no Blackwater-protected person has been killed or seriously wounded -- they presumably knew their jobs and did them well.
> 
> But the Iraqis -- and many of our own military -- have never accepted their presence. The press, both there and here, often calls the guards who work for Blackwater and other companies such as Triple Canopy ìmercenariesî and ìtrigger-happy cowboys.î The Iraqis briefly banned Blackwater operations after the Nisour Square incident, but then relented after the US agreed to a joint investigation. An Iraqi investigation found that the Raven 23 team fired without provocation. That conclusion -- disputed by all but one of the Blackwater guards -- falls into a legal void.
> 
> Post-invasion Iraq has been a largely lawless place. Because there are too few troops trained in executive protection (far too few to protect the large number of State, CIA and other government employees in Iraq) the State Department and other agencies had to hire contractors to perform protective services. (According to a Congressional Research Service report, as of September 2008, there are still about 10,000 contractor personnel in Iraq providing quasi-military security services.)
> 
> Ever since the new Iraqi government began to function, there has been enormous political pressure to end the immunity from Iraqi law the contractors have had since L. Paul Bremer decreed it in 2003. Under the new Status of Forces Agreement, the immunity will no longer protect contractors from Iraqi prosecution, but Bremerís decree was in effect at the time of the Nisour Square incident.
> 
> The biggest legal problem with the Raven 23 indictments is the statute that allegedly enables them to be tried for the shootings under US law. The Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act enables US courts to punish crimes committed by Defense Department contractors overseas. It has been amended to include other agenciesí contractors who are acting in support of the DoD mission. But Raven 23 was acting under a State Department contract to protect a State Department official, which isnít DoDís job.
> 
> The weasel-worded indictments stretch MEJA beyond the factual and into the political, saying that the Blackwater mission is ìrelated to supporting the mission of the Department of Defense in Iraq.î But ìrelated to supportingî could cover any crime in Iraq. Why is this alleged crime by non-DoD contractors ìrelated to supporting the mission of the Department of Defenseî being prosecuted when others have not, unless it is designed to make good on a political promise?
> 
> That allegation that MEJA covers the Nisour Square incident is also highly suspect because three government agencies ñ including the State Department itself ñ have concluded that MEJA cannot be used to prosecute this case.
> 
> After the Nisour Square incident, Secretary Rice tasked a panel of outside experts to review the State Departmentís security policy in Iraq. It reported in October 2007. The panelís report says, in part, ìThe legal framework for providing proper oversight of Personal Protective Service (PPS) contractors is inadequate, in that the Panel is unaware of any basis for holding non-Department of Defense contractors accountable under US law.î
> 
> If that were not enough, the Congressional Research Serviceís report (number RL32419) has made the same finding both before and after the Nisour Square incident.
> 
> The July 11, 2007 version finds that MEJA, ìÖdoes not appear to cover civilian and contract employees of agencies engaged in their own operations overseas.î The updated version dated September 29, 2008 says essentially the same thing: ìDepending on how broadly DoDís mission is construed, MEJA does not appear to cover civilian and contract employees engaged in their own operations overseas.î
> 
> A third arm of the US government ñ Congressís Government Accountability Office ñ adopted the State Department report in its own July 2008 report on oversight of private security contractors in Iraq.
> 
> Raven 23 was part of a Blackwater group under contract to the State Department. In the Nisour Square incident, they were acting to help protect a State Department protected person whose own convoy was racing back to the protection of the Green Zone. In the indictments and in the proffer in support of a guilty plea of one of the Blackwater Raven 23 men, Jeremy Ridgeway, they are described as having violated the State Departmentís ìMission Firearms Policy.î
> 
> The government must be bound by the proofs it presents to the court. The facts alleged in the Ridgeway proffer show that the men of Raven 23 cannot be prosecuted. They were State Department contractors, on a State Department mission. Under Statesí own analysis -- and that of both CRS and GAO -- they are not criminally liable under MEJA. All that is left is politics.
> 
> Why is the law being stretched so thin to reach men working for the State Department on a State Department mission if not to make political points with the Iraqi government? The court should throw out the indictments and dismiss all charges because the law does not allow them.
> 
> Unfortunately for the men of Raven 23 and for the rule of law, the case has been assigned to US District Court Judge Ricardo Urbina. You should remember Judge Urbina: he is the one who ordered the release of Uighur prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba loose among the population of the United States. A left-wing politically-minded judge is the worst possible pick to preside over such a politically-motivated case.

Can you think of another group that has gone to the point of self-flagellation to purge prejudice from its ranks?

While many believe that prejudice has diminished over time, it's not really true.† Prejudice is much like the wind: Its direction changes, and the sheltered and well-situated may not sense it, but it's always blowing on some people somewhere.† Put literally, every age has its fashionable biases†‚Äì and unfashionable people.
This was obvious during the presidential inauguration <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYPi8sSwP5Y&feature=related>benediction, given by the Reverend Joseph Lowery.† While making a supplication to the Lord, he made the following anachronistic plea:
> . . . help us work for that day when black will not be asked to get back, when brown can stick around, when yellow will be mellow, when the red man can get ahead, man, and when white will embrace what is right [emphasis mine]."
Well, I wonder if the Reverend has ever asked the Lord why He scourged the world with white people in the first place. ††
It isn't surprising that <http://www.americanthinker.com/2008/05/the_crime_of_being_white.html>caucaphobia is in fashion.† You can demonize any person, group or place; all you need do is focus on the object's failings to the exclusion of its/his accomplishments.† It isn't even hard to do. †To bastardize one of Abraham Lincoln's lines, if you look for the worst in a group, you're sure to find it.† It's just as with a person.† If I repeatedly disseminated your sins and mistakes among the town folk while downplaying your good points, how long would it be before they were chasing you with pitchforks?
So it has been with whites for a long time now.† It is not correct to say that history textbooks, documentaries and entertainment inundate us with stories about slavery and civil rights abuses; no, they inundate us with stories about whites' practice of slavery and abuse of civil rights.† There are movies such as Roots and Mississippi Burning but none of note about the Aztecs' or Shaka Zulu's domination of neighboring peoples, or the current African slave trade or Zimbabwean "president" Robert Mugabe's <http://www.slate.com/id/81386/>persecution of whites and political opponents.† Then, relating the American history guidelines of a prominent textbook publisher, the author of The Language Police, Diane Ravitch, <http://www.ednews.org/articles/25/1/Political-Correctness-and-Textbooks/Page1.html>writes:
> European Americans, the guidelines suggest, were uniquely responsible for bigotry and exploitation in all human history.
This philosophy imbues school textbooks. †While featured prominently are the sins of whites, others' sins are whitewashed.† For instance, due to special-interest-group pressure†‚Äì such as that applied by <http://www.historytextbooks.org/islamreport.pdf>Moslem activists†‚Äì examples of slavery perpetrated by non-whites are in short supply or are sanitized.† This, despite the fact that Moslem North Africans did at one time capture young boys of both the white and black races, castrate them and sell them into slavery.† And this bias is a continuation of decades of anti-white propaganda of the kind embodied in Susan Sontag's famous 1967 line, "The white race is the cancer of human history." †It's an idea that has taken hold.
Thus must I mount a defense of the white race.† But I want to preface it with a few remarks.† First, don't ask why I undertake such an endeavor.† When the President has a preacher talking about the black, brown, yellow, red and white, it's silly to ask why I speak of race.† I'm not initiating such a discussion, I'm responding.† I'm not throwing punches, I'm blocking.
Second, because of this†‚Äì since I'm refuting those who assign blame by highlighting the sins of whites†‚Äì it's necessary that I trumpet whites' accomplishments.† Unlike those I'm refuting, however†‚Äì who often ascribe the evils they feature to something inherent in whites†‚Äì I don't claim there is an innate quality in the race that should be credited with all these triumphs.† On the contrary, I believe the force primarily responsible for Western civilization's glories is Christianity, but that is grist for a different day.
It's not hard to figure out where a defense of whites must start: Slavery.† It's the most odd of issues, in that we all thoroughly agree on the wrongness of it yet it is thoroughly divisive.† It is the defining grievance of black America, something that imbues millions of black psyches.† As an example, I attended a gathering a few years ago at which there was a certain guest, a rather emotive and outgoing black fellow who was very good at relating every topic of discussion, from the meaningful to the mundane, to America's slavery.† It was as if he could channel Kunta Kinte in every conversation. †††
Yet the reality of slavery is that, along with prostitution, it is one of the world's oldest institutions.† It is mentioned in the Bible and Koran, and, to the best of my knowledge, every major civilization has practiced it.† And, if we're to believe history and Afro-centrists (and I suppose you cannot believe both), the ancient Egyptians were black and enslaved Jews.
Moreover, the Islamic slave trade took at least as many Africans into bondage as did the European variety, and African tribes themselves had slaves and sold them to both civilizations.† Additionally, while the word "slave" conjures up the image of a black person in the typical American mind, the term itself is derived from the word "Slav."† This is because great numbers of Slavs were once sold into slavery by conquering peoples.† In other words, no group ever cornered the market on slavery†‚Äì it touched every corner of the Earth.
Yet, in the history of involuntary servitude, something else should be noted.† It is a startling fact:
While whites weren't the first ones to practice slavery, they were the first ones to abolish it.†
Let's be clear about this.† Slavery was accepted.† It was the status quo.† It was an institution whose origin was shrouded in the mists of time.† It was unquestioned.†
That is, until Europeans said "No more."†
It was not Asians who effected this bold and unprecedented social change.† It was not South Americans.† It was not Africans.† It was not American Indians.† It was not Aborigines.† It was Europeans, that cancer of human history, and they were just as white then as they are today.† They gave the world change you can really believe in.†
People will try to explain away this historical fact, saying that this striking example of man's humanity to man has nothing to do with race.† I will simply reiterate that the why of the matter is a discussion for a different day.† For now, I'm content to say that if whites can be demonized without explanation for being one of many groups to enslave Africans, they can be credited without explanation for being the first group to outlaw the enslavement of anyone.
One of the reasons we fixate on slavery that ended more than 150 years ago concerns the effects many believe it has today.† This is called the "legacy of slavery," which, actually, seems not nearly as big a problem as the legacy of obsessing on legacies.† Be that as it may, what is the real legacy of slavery?†
Well, let's think about it: Many lament blacks' economic state in America, claiming it is†part of slavery's legacy.† But where would blacks be were it not for slavery?† The answer is Africa, where people's economic state is far, far worse than that of American blacks.
In other words, there is no reason to agonize over an event†‚Äì even an evil one†‚Äì responsible for your presence in a country that has offered its citizens unprecedented rights and standard of living.† (Of course, to be precise, most blacks currently in the U.S. would not actually have been worse off absent slavery.† This is because they wouldn't have "been" at all, as ancestors whose procreation led to their existence would never even have met.†The big picture is a funny thing, isn't it?)
The point is that most people who arrived on American shores were driven here by some kind of persecution.† Whatever the reason, however, thank God we're in the land of opportunity and not languishing in a slum in Asia, South America, Africa or Eastern Europe.† So, it's ironic, but that some blacks were brought here in chains yesterday ensured that their descendants wouldn't have to wear chains today.
Now we come to prejudice, another supposedly characteristic white fault. †Yet the truth is quite the opposite.† In reality, racial prejudice is probably found least among whites, due to political correctness.
Most white children are raised today with the idea that it's profoundly immoral to be prejudiced (I discussed this <http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=59129>here).† This isn't to say there aren't some Archie Bunker types extant, but they certainly aren't in fashion.† Remember, it was mainly white people who originated, promoted and funded sensitivity-training classes, tolerance programs and multiculturalism (come to think of it, I may start hating white people myself).† Now, while I consider these abominations to be worse than what they ostensibly remedy, this brings us to a relevant question: Can you think of another group that has gone to the point of self-flagellation to purge prejudice from its ranks?† Heck, with how we beat each other up over this, no one really has to worry at all about whites.† We're all black and blue.
Then we have the matter of white achievement.† The vast majority of what makes the lives of all races better today†‚Äì modern science and medicine; our luxuries; Western art, literature, legal institutions; etc.†‚Äì is the handiwork of whites.† Oh, this is simply a matter of circumstance, of opportunity, of a twist of fate, you say?† Perhaps.† Again, this is not the time to discuss the ways and whys.† Suffice it to say for now that if President Obama (PBUH) can frame matters in terms of race at his inauguration (and in his books and everywhere else, it seems), I can in an article.† And if whites can be ridiculed for their transgressions, they can be recognized for their triumphs.††††
Yet, despite all this and more, caucaphobia is still not only accepted but often encouraged.† And the hypocrisy is stark.† The Left admonishes against making even valid generalizations or entertaining intellectual discussions about group differences. †And indulging stereotyping†‚Äì that specter of egalitarian nightmares†‚Äì can fast earn one pariah status in addition to a place on the unemployment line. Why, even the positive variety is off limits.† We cannot say blacks are better athletes, even though the sports arena may bear witness to this; we cannot say Asians are more intelligent, even though they have the highest average I.Q. of any major racial group; we cannot say Latinos are good dancers (not sure about that one).† The idea is that such beliefs can lead to stigmatization or resentment or, or . . . whatever the theory du jour may be.
But when the matter is whites, even baseless negative stereotypes aren't thought cause for alarm.† A Reverend Lowery can imply that whites are uniquely flawed and immoral, they can be portrayed as the bane of man, as "the cancer of human history," and it's ho-hum.
Yet, are we to believe that such demonization magically becomes harmless when whites are the targets?† What does history teach about the plight of consistently scapegoated and dehumanized groups?† It's that they almost invariably end up suffering persecution.† And given that current demographic trends indicate whites will becomes a minority in America during the lifetimes of many reading this, and given that even majorities sometimes are tyrannized†‚Äì as Sunnis' domination of Shiites under Saddam Hussein and the Spartans' enslavement of the Helots proved†‚Äì it's foolish to dismiss the peril posed by mainstreaming caucaphobia.† (In fact, whites already suffer the sting of persecution; I documented some cases <http://selwynduke.typepad.com/selwyndukecom/2008/05/read-a-book-get.html#more>here and <http://www.americanthinker.com/2008/05/the_crime_of_being_white.html>here).
Yet, that increasingly-maligned dead white male Ben Franklin knew whereof he spoke when he said, "You cannot reason a man out of a position he has not reasoned himself into."† Prejudice is a function of emotion, not logic, and emotion is like darkness, in that it can be blinding.† A person who sees only color†‚Äì and through colored glasses†‚Äì will have a powerful immunity to facts.† Thus, I only expect caucaphobia to intensify.†
So what can we do?† Well, prayer is always good, so I'll conclude with one of my own right now.† Lord, we ask you to help us work for that day when black will cease the attack, brown will no longer frown, white will be all right†‚Äì and rhymes will fit the times.

SENATE DEMOCRATS KILL E VERIFY!


A Sellout of Our Unemployed
by† <http://www.humanevents.com/search.php?author_name=Patrick J.+Buchanan>Patrick J. Buchanan
03/13/2009

By the choices we make we define ourselves. We reveal our biases and beliefs. And so, too, do our institutions.
In writing the $789 billion stimulus bill, Congress revealed that, for all its "Buy American" blather, it does not truly put America first. It does not believe that 10 million jobless Americans, in the country their fathers built, should receive any preference in hiring 12 million to 20 million illegal aliens who broke into this country and owe her no loyalty, allegiance or love.
Is this a slur on the patriotism of some of our congressmen? You betcha.
What other conclusion can one reach after Congress refused to require that employers on construction projects, paid for by U.S. tax dollars in the stimulus bill, verify that their workers are Americans?
<http://clk.atdmt.com/goiframe/63242537/130838141/direct/01><http://ec.atdmt.com/b/FRINVFSHIFSI/2351_FII_FallFarther_SB_qualnow_300x250_0109.gif>
For that is precisely what Congress did.
The first paragraph of the front-page story in USA Today says it all. "Los Angeles -- Tens of thousands of jobs created by the economic stimulus law could end up filled by illegal immigrants, particularly in big states like California where undocumented workers are heavily represented in construction, experts on both sides of the issue say."
According to the Center for Immigration Studies, illegal aliens will take 300,000 of the 2 million construction jobs to be created by the stimulus bill. The CIS figure is based on Census Bureau estimates that 15 percent of all construction workers are illegal aliens or immigrants who are not authorized to work in the United States.
Robert Rector of Heritage Foundation concurs with the figures on the number of jobs Congress just voted to give to non-Americans.
"Without specific mechanisms to ensure that workers are U.S. citizens or legally authorized to work, it is likely that 15 percent of these workers, or 300,000, would be illegal immigrants."
Other experts put the figure far higher than 15 percent, and certainly higher in California and other Southwestern states, where illegals tend to congregate.
In taking these jobs, illegals will be shouldering aside unemployed Americans. Yet Congress could have, with one vote, guaranteed that virtually every job paid for by U.S. taxpayers would go to U.S. workers.
How? By mandating that all beneficiaries of stimulus money use the E-Verify program of the Department of Homeland Security, which lets employers check the validity of the Social Security number of all new hires. E-Verify is available on a voluntary basis. It is simple, swift and easy to use.
Indeed, E-Verify is becoming standard operating procedure for U.S. businesses that wish to obey the law. According to NumbersUSA, U.S. businesses have used E-Verify in 3 million inquiries this year alone. That is almost half the total of 6.6 million inquiries for all of 2008 and five times the rate of use in 2007.
E-Verify is a smashing success with an accuracy rate of over 99 percent that holds out promise of a day when every employer in America will be able to ensure that every employee is an American or someone authorized to work here. At its rising rate of use, one-fourth to one-third of all new hires could soon be checked by E-Verify.
Isn't this what we all want, what we have all sought -- an easy, verifiable, non-intrusive, inexpensive way for businesses to assure that those they hire are in our country legally?
No, it is not. For Tuesday night, the Senate voted to strip away this protection of American workers from the unfair competition of illegal aliens.
The Senate voted 50 to 47 to end E-Verify in six months, when current funding runs out. Sen. Jeff Sessions' proposal to give this successful program five more years was rejected 50 to 47.
Republicans and seven Democrats voted to save E-Verify. But only Democrats voted to kill it.
How did Harry Reid kill the E-Verify provision that was in the House version of the stimulus package? The Senate was not even allowed to vote on it. And when the two bills were reconciled in the Pelosi-Reid conference, E-Verify disappeared.
This was a huge victory for La Raza and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, whose lobbyists have labored long to ensure that their member companies pay no price for dumping U.S. workers and hiring illegal aliens.
Yet, this battle is not over. If Americans understand that the Pelosi-Reid Democrats have no problem with illegal aliens taking jobs from unemployed Americans, that party can be made to pay a price in 2010.
As of today, there exists a Republican-Blue Dog Democrat coalition in both houses that is serious about putting our country and countrymen first, be it on spending bills or trade measures. This is a foundation to build on.
E-Verify is not dead. For the Reid-Pelosi-Obama Left cannot survive the perception that it is aiding and abetting illegal aliens in taking the jobs of unemployed Americans.

Obama Hides Death Tax Proposal in a Footnote
by† <http://www.humanevents.com/search.php?author_name=Dick+Patten>Dick Patten
03/12/2009

What‚Äôs the difference between President Obama and an eighth-grade student?

The student knows the proper way to use a footnote.

Footnotes are generally used to disclose sources or to explain an obscure fact. They are not used to recommend massive tax policy changes. Yet this is just what Obama does in his Fiscal Year 2010 Budget Proposal.
<http://ads.he.valueclick.net/redirect?banner=a0125028&host=h0004493&size=300x250&t=js&c=00&target_id=0&dart_timestamp=1237042975.4901405><http://cdn.valueclick.net/ad.s/0125/a0125028.gif>

Slog through the budget to page 127, and see footnote 1, which states, ‚Äú[T]he estate tax is maintained at its 2009 parameters.‚Äù What does this mean?

Under current law enacted by the Bush tax relief of 2001, the death tax is scheduled to be repealed for one year in 2010. Due to complex Senate budget reconciliation rules, the tax then comes back at the rate of 55% in 2011. Obama‚Äôs footnote assumes that Congress will cancel the temporary repeal and make the death tax permanent at the rate of 45%.

President Bush and most of the Republicans have been fighting to make repeal permanent for the last eight years. This change would render all those efforts asunder.

That‚Äôs a pretty significant policy proposal. Why is Obama hiding it deep in his budget in a footnote? Is there a reason to be so secretive?

Oh, right. Obama has probably heard that taxes which punish people for saving and investing don‚Äôt help the economy. He may have read reports from his own chief economic advisor, Larry Summers, who has said that the death tax is bad policy.

Economists on the left and the right agree -- the death tax takes a huge bite out of productive capital in the economy. Two of President Clinton‚Äôs chief economic advisors -- Joseph Stiglitz and Alicia Munnell -- have written extensively about the impact of the tax on capital.

The Joint Economic Committee has calculated that the death tax reduces the stock of capital in the economy by $847 billion. That is $847 billion that can‚Äôt be used to start new businesses, expand existing operations, and create new jobs.

Obama probably realizes that in a time of economic turmoil, confiscating nearly half the capital of productive businesses is the last thing the federal government should do, especially if he is concerned about job creation.

The American Family Business Foundation‚Äôs new study by Dr. Douglas Holtz-Eakin finds that the death tax is responsible for lowering overall employment by 1.5 million jobs.

In the case of family owned businesses and farms, the loss of any capital can have a devastating impact on the survival of the enterprise. Family owned businesses are highly reliant on inheritances to finance the business and keep it viable. When the death tax confiscates a substantial portion of the inheritance, it makes it difficult for the heirs to maintain the business.

Obama has probably heard the stories of family business owners who are wiped out by the death tax or who are forced to cut jobs in order to keep the business running. In Biloxi, Miss., the Mavar family was forced to sell their multi-generational family business to a large national corporation due to looming death tax liabilities. They hoped that the corporation would keep the business and its jobs in Biloxi, but within five years, the entire business was relocated out of state.

The Mavars‚Äô story is just one of the many stories that describe the real human costs of the death tax.

And of course, Obama might realize that taxing those who work hard, save and invest, and leave an inheritance to their children, is simply unjust. People who have already paid taxes on their income shouldn‚Äôt be punished for being responsible throughout their life and creating wealth and jobs for others.

68% of Americans agree that the death tax is unjust and should be repealed. These same Americans certainly do not support permanently shackling the nation with a 45% death tax.

Clearly, Obama doesn‚Äôt want to hurt his popularity by promoting the hated death tax. Ergo, rather than openly supporting the tax, President Obama is promoting it on the sly in his budget proposal.

All thanks to clever use of a footnote.

Of course, this is only the budget proposal, and it will not determine the future of the death tax. Even so, it sets the tone for the administration‚Äôs policy goals and their tactical mindset.

Clearly, if Obama can‚Äôt be upfront about the tax plans in his budget proposal, he knows that he faces strong opposition.

Let‚Äôs see how long he can keep his secret.
Mr. Patten is executive director of the <http://www.nodeathtax.org/>American Family Business Institute, a nationwide organization of family business owners devoted to the permanent repeal of the estate tax.
