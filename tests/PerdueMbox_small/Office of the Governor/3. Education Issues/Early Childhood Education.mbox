Dear Governor Perdue,
     We are writing you to express our tremendous concern for the More at Four budget cuts and possible merging with smart start.  This merge will result in More at Four no longer being a highly qualified educational program, but rather custodial care with non-certified staff.  The at-risk children served by More at Four are more successful when entering Kindergarten due to their exposure and experiences.  We invite you to look at the data assessments of the More at Four children and please feel welcome to come visit our classrooms.  You need to see first hand how this program impacts children and the consequences that will result if More at Four is dissolved.   
                                                                                 Sincerely, 
                                                                                     Yours for Children
                                                                                      Janet Murray, Marilyn Arndt, Angela Williamson, Jenna St. Pierre

Subject: Your July 27th Letter

Comment: Thank you for your letter to Teachers and Teacher Assistants. I have been a teacher assistant for 7 1/2 years at the elementary l evel. I have been really stressed still not knowing if I will have a job when the new year begins in 3 weeks. As of today, I do not know my grade position. No matter how small my income, our family depends on that money. I have a rising high school senior and am very excited about her attending college after next year. I have worked in Special Ed classes as well as regular ed classes. I understand the importance of teacher assistants in our schools. I am very sad and disappointed that those of us, who work for the education of the child and not the amount of our paycheck , are not appreciated. Eleven of my co-workers lost their jobs as teacher assistants. Those eleven had great abilities with children, 2-4 year college degrees and some had just passed their tests to teach. Not one thought was placed on who was being cut, their abilities or their education. God please help our schools!

Thank you Governor Perdue for listening to North Carolinians.
I noticed that non-teaching educational personnel increased more than new hired teachers the last two years. Could we perhaps eliminate many of those administrative positions?

> The executive order directs the Office of State Budget and Management (OSBM) to prioritize spending on mandatory obligations and to restrict state agency spending on travel and purchase orders for goods and services. It also restricts agency spending to fill vacant positions.

> To protect the stateís core responsibilities in education and public safety, the order allows OSBM to make exceptions for direct expenses for classroom instruction and emergency situations related to law enforcement, health care and public safety.

Subject: Budget Cuts

Comment: I have worked with Graville County Schools for 18 years as a Media Assistant. 16 of those years were at Butner-Stem Elementary and the past 2 at Granville Central High. With the budget cuts, I lost my position, no Media Assistants in Granville County. Frankly, I do not know how the Media Coordinators are going to make it without their assistants. My Media Coordinators and I stayed busy with students every second of every day. Now all Media Coordinators are alone and the ones to suffer will be the students. Fortunately, I received my certification from UNCGiSchool as a Facilitator and I will facilitate on-line classes with NCVPS and UNCGiSchool this coming school year. Thank God I have something to fall back on. My request to you is to please, remember when you cut TA positions, the students suffer. We want future strong and smart leaders. Would you not want your children or grandchildren to have the best education? Allow this to happen, do not cut our jobs. Thanks you in advance for any help you can give with this matter. Ms. Susan E.

> Gov. Perdue's Probabtion Reforms to Improve Public Safety

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Thursday†announced significant reforms to the probation system that will speed the process of obtaining warrants for parole commission violators and put more information into the hands of law enforcement officers on the streets.
These reforms include the following changes:
- The Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission will respond to requests for warrants within 24 hours;
- Probation officers will receive a response to a violation report within that same 24 hours;
- If a warrant is issued it will be entered into the DCI network immediately; and
- Law enforcement officers across North Carolina will have immediate access to information about probationers and prison inmates on their vehicle computers whenever a license check is conducted.
In addition, the governor signed Senate Bill 920, her proposal to:
- Allow probation officers the authority to perform warrantless searches on supervised probationers;
- Give law enforcement officers the ability to perform warrantless searches if they have reasonable suspicion that the probationer is engaged in criminal activity or possesses a weapon without written court permission;
- Allow probation officers limited access to juvenile criminal records, providing them with better insight into the risks offenders pose;
‚ÄúWith these changes, law enforcement and probation officers will have immediate access to probation information and will be better prepared to protect themselves and their communities,‚Äù Perdue said. ‚ÄúThese reforms will strengthen our probation system and make our communities safer.
‚ÄúThis kind of access to information is crucial for the safety of our officers, our law enforcement partners and the public,‚Äù said Correction Secretary Alvin Keller.† ‚ÄúNo longer will probation violators be able to hide from the system.‚Äù
Also, Governor Perdue announced that information from the Department of Correction offender database of more than 1.1 million criminal offenders is being shared with the law enforcement community via the DCI network.
Since the computer system for law enforcement vehicles was activated on June 24, officers have entered roughly 128,000 queries, and 1,146 probation absconders have been arrested.

Gov. Perdue Signs Bill Establishing Stricter Safety Oversight of Coal Ash Ponds

Gov. Perdue today signed Senate Bill 1004, increasing the safety oversight of coal ash ponds in North Carolina. The legislation subjects dams that create coal ash ponds to direct inspection by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources.†
‚ÄúBecause of potential risk posed by the location of North Carolina‚Äôs coal ash ponds, we must provide greater oversight and more frequent inspections,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúThis legislation will keep our citizens safer and our dams more secure.‚Äù
In June, the Environmental Protection Agency released a list of 44 ‚Äúhigh-hazard‚Äù coal ash waste dams across the county. Twelve of these dams were located in North Carolina, more than any other state. A ‚Äúhigh hazard‚Äù designation was created in the 1980‚Äôs for coal ash impoundments and other similar dams that are near densely populated areas, downstream water supplies, important public utilities or primary highways because of the potential impact of a dam‚Äôs failure.† The designation does not reflect the structural condition of the dam.†
Currently, power companies are only required to file reports every five years by private engineers on the structural conditions of the dams.† The reports are filed with the N.C. Utilities Commission and the impoundments are exempt from regulation under the N.C. Dam Safety Act.
This legislation, sponsored by Sen. David Hoyle (D-Guilford) and led by Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) in the House, places coal ash dams and ponds under the regulation of the Dam Safety Act. This means the structures will be more closely regulated, and requires a state inspection every two years.†

15 Contracts Totaling More Than $29 Million Awarded for Highway Projects Across NC

Gov. Bev Perdue†today†announced that 15 contracts totaling $29.3 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including seven projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The contracts were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.
‚ÄúThese projects will stimulate economic growth by creating and maintaining jobs as we enhance safety and keep our people traveling,‚Äù Perdue said.
According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.
For more information about funding for infrastructure improvements in North Carolina, as well as other NCDOT projects and activities, visit <http://www.ncdot.gov/>www.ncdot.gov.

NC†Submits Grant Application for Economic Recovery Funding for I-85 Improvement Project

North Carolina has submitted a grant application for $300 million in discretionary grant money included in the ARRA to use for the I-85 Corridor Improvement Project, which includes replacing the I-85 bridge over the Yadkin River, in Davidson and Rowan counties. Comprehensive information about the project is available on a new Web site, <http://www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/>www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/.
‚ÄúReplacing this bridge is critical to preserving safety, travel and commerce along this vital interstate route and is an ideal candidate for recovery funding,‚Äù Perdue said. ‚ÄúThese improvements are essential to ensuring that I-85 continues to move people and goods safely and effectively on a regional, statewide and national level.‚Äù
Perdue has been working with Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and North Carolina‚Äôs congressional delegation to obtain funding for the project. It also has received tremendous support from local communities and business leaders advocating for the project. Nearly 100 letters and resolutions of endorsement have been received to date and can be viewed on the project Web site.
The I-85 Corridor Improvement Project will complete a comprehensive overhaul of the highway, bridge and rail infrastructure located along 6.8 miles of I-85 from north of Long Ferry Road (Exit 81) in Rowan County to U.S. 29-52-70/I-85 Business (Exit 87) in Davidson County. The project would be completed under two design-build contracts, which allow project teams of designers and contractors to conduct design and construction work simultaneously to expedite completion, at an estimated cost of more than $300 million.
I-85 is the most direct and heavily traveled route between Richmond and Atlanta. The stretch of highway included in this project currently carries nearly 70,000 vehicles per day, with traffic counts projected to more than double by 2030. Trucks account for 26 percent of the traffic along this portion of I-85.
Right now, this stretch has only two lanes in each direction, with narrow shoulders, sharp curves and closely spaced interchanges. The existing I-85 Yadkin River Bridge is outdated and narrow and is currently rated in poor condition and classified as both structurally deficient (having elements that need to be monitored and/or repaired) and functionally obsolete (outdated in design).
The total crash rate for this portion of I-85 is about 77 percent higher than the average crash rate for comparable roadways across the state, while the fatal crash rate is 80 percent higher.
The project is expected to reduce crash rates by 75 percent and improve traffic flow by alleviating existing bottlenecks. Improvements to the railroad tracks that cross under I-85 will increase track speed by 45 percent and accommodate future rail needs, including the implementation of high-speed rail.
from an economic standpoint, the project has the potential to create or sustain more than 7,000 jobs, and it is expected to result in economic benefits 12 to 17 times its cost. This stretch of I-85 is in a region of the state that has been hard-hit by job losses, with both Davidson and Rowan counties qualifying as economically distressed areas under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965.

Gov. Perdue Joins Statewide Health Leaders at President's Town Hall

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Wednesday†joined health leaders from across North Carolina to attend President Barack Obama‚Äôs health care forum at Broughton High School in Raleigh. The governor invited representatives from the state‚Äôs leading health care organizations, including hospitals, research institutions, advocates and minority groups, to attend the event with her.
‚ÄúI applaud the president for prioritizing health care and for working with Congress to bring about change,‚Äù Perdue said. ‚ÄúHere in North Carolina, one in five of our citizens does not have health insurance. We are living the problem, and we are all anxious for a solution.
‚ÄúWhen I spoke to President Obama this morning, I told him I believe strongly that reform must take place at the federal level.† We have innovative solutions to providing care in North Carolina, and we have excellent providers, but our finances are stretched to the limit.† We must ensure that the financial burden of a new system cannot fall to the states.† A national health care system must provide the right care, at the right time, at the right place ‚Äì but at a price that people, and states, can afford.‚Äù

Subject: Middle School After School programs or lack thereof

Comment: I voted for Gov. Perdue and applaud her support of education. However I am dismayed, to say the least, that Support Our Students funding from the Justic and Public Safety Operating Budget appears to have been cut. I relied on Durham County Public Schools middle schooll ENCORE! program for the past 2 years for affordable after school care. Traditional calendar schools start is a couple of weeks (year round already well underway as you know) and NO AFTERSCHOOL CARE is available!!! I cannot believe the shortsightedness of cutting afterschool funding. Maybe it could have been moved to Dept of Educ. I have an honor roll student so am not concerned about him landing on the streets or in a gang, but this is a real possiblility for many kids. As it is, it is a logistic and economic hardship to try to find alternate care or just have my kid home alone until I get home from work. I cannot afford church based or commercial after school care. It is shameful for the legislators to have lollygagged when they are being paid handsomely and have no afterschool care available well into the school year!! It is a vital resource and surely monies could have been cut elsewhere. How about having state employees pony up some money toward their healthcare for one?! This is an absurd sacred cow. I am self-employed and have had no health insurance for years. I have no sympathy for covered state employees who don't have to pay toward their insurance. Cut principals and other school administrators absurdly high pay to help fund other education expenses. Let teachers - who each earn more than my 3-person household - buy their own laptops, etc. Come one now! Thank you for your time and attention. Elaine Levine

Subject: Reduction of Faculty Staff Tuition Waiver

Comment: I'm deeply disappointed that you have signed legislation to reduce a benefit for educators: The Governor signed into law Senate Bill 202, The Appropriations Act of 2009 (Session Law 2009-451). A provision of the Act reduces the number of free courses a full-time faculty or full-time staff member may enroll in per academic year, from three to two courses, effective July 1, 2009. You may also refer to Senate Bill 202 (section 9) at the following link: http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Sessions/2009/Bills/Senate/PDF/S202v7.pdf (look at page 63..) I believe those who work in education should have ample access to courses that can be used to promote personal and professional growth. If there is space available in a classroom, what is the harm in allowing an employee to register for the course? You have not demonstrated the qualities of an "Education Governor" that you purport to possess. This, in my view, is an unnecessary reduction of an excellent benefit. I encourage you to reconsider for July 2010. Sincerely, Jeffrey Huckel Registered Voter

Subject: NC Earn

Comment: I guess this was a joke when you made this statement about NC Earn ha. So the state of NC does not stand behind the statements made on the NC Earn website. North Carolina is committed to making a debt-free undergraduate education attainable and affordable for every student. EARN Grants give students who think they might not be able to pay for college the chance to get the undergraduate degree that will boost their chances to compete and succeed in the global economy. "Learn and Earn is more than an opportunity for a college education -- it's an opportunity for a bright future. I am proud to be part of it and hope you will be too." -- Governor, Bev Perdue

I don't know what this has to do with†allowing out-of-state college athletes†to pay in-state tuition. The point about school districts hiring back teachers would not have been possible without the 1%†sales tax increase. I'll go back to my original point which is "why are athletics more important than education"? I don't think you really addressed my issue and I don't think Governor Perdue ever saw my email.

> Budget Revenue Enables School Districts to Rehire Teachers, Protect Jobs

This yearís budget shortfall was a major challenge.† It was the toughest budget situation since the Great Depression, with a $4.5 billion shortfall. While the final version of the budget was far from perfect, it did†include significantly more revenue for public schools than†previous proposals.† Additionally, public school systems are directly receiving almost $600 million in federal recovery funds during the next two years.

> So far, at least a dozen superintendents in North Carolina have already announced they will restore or save teacher jobs by maximizing those resources.† Governor Perdue strongly urges superintendents across the state to do the same.

> Gov. Perdue Signs North Carolina Racial Justice Act

Gov. Perdue†on Tuesday†signed Senate Bill 461, the North Carolina Racial Justice Act, which permits defendants and inmates to challenge death sentences by presenting statistical evidence of†racial bias. The bill was sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Floyd McKissick (D-Durham) and in the House by Rep. Larry Womble (D-Forsyth), Rep. Earline Parmon (D-Forsyth), Rep. Paul Luebke (D-Durham) and Rep Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford).

> ìI have always been a supporter of death penalty, but I have always believed it must be carried out fairly,î said Perdue. ìThe Racial Justice Act ensures that when North Carolina hands down our stateís harshest punishment to our most heinous criminals ñ the decision is based on the facts and the law, not racial prejudice.î

> The Racial Justice Act will allow inmates on death row and persons charged with a capital crime to present a judge with evidence that shows race was a significant factor that led to the imposition of the death sentence. If the judge agrees with the evidence, the death sentence can be overturned to life in prison without possibility of parole.

> Deutsche Bank to Create 319 Jobs in Wake County

Deutsche Bank AG will open a technology development center in Wake County. Operating as DB Global Technology Inc., a newly formed subsidiary, the company plans to invest $6.7 million and create 319 jobs during the next five years.

> ìThis new center is a great fit for North Carolina. We are a strong international competitor in both the information technology and financial sectors,î Perdue said. ìOur reputation for excellence in these areas, combined with a dedicated workforce and a top business climate, continues to attract quality global companies such as Deutsche Bank.î

> Perdue has made creating well-paying, sustainable jobs a top priority of her administration through the JobsNOW initiative. The new jobs at DB Global Technology will pay an overall average wage of $88,213, not including benefits, which is significantly higher than the Wake County average of $43,160.

> Through Perdueís JobsNOW initiative, the state will continue to work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain workers, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

> Visitor Spending Rises in 62 N.C. Counties in 2008

Gov. Bev Perdue announced†on Wednesday†that 62 of the stateís 100 counties saw increases in visitor spending in 2008, including 16 counties that had increases of more than 5 percent.

> Data from the N.C. Department of Commerceís Division of Tourism, Film and Sports Development showed domestic visitors to and within North Carolina spent a record $16.9 billion in 2008, an increase of 2.1 percent from 2007.

> Visitor expenditures directly generated 190,500 jobs and nearly $4.2 billion in payroll income within North Carolina in 2008.† Payroll increased 3.9 percent from 2007. Visitor spending in the state also directly generated close to $2.7 billion in tax revenue for federal, state and local governments in 2008, up 3.6 percent from 2007.

> ìWe know that current economic conditions are affecting businesses all across the state, including those in the tourism industry,î Gov. Perdue said. ìBut this continued economic growth, and especially growth in tax revenues, is encouraging.î

 Governor Perdue, Lt. Gov. Dalton, Senator Boseman, and Ms. Garland 
Sen. Boseman,  I think the next step is yours but we both know the support of the Governor and Lt. Governor would really help this idea along!

Ok we are back to a new school year and I'm sure new legislative agendas. So, I want to remind all of the interested (I hope interested) parties that the lottery idea for a teachers bonus has not gone away. I still think this is a good, low cost idea that has a huge up side and little downside. I have left all the emails attached incase someone has forgotten what the original idea was. Our teachers just got the "Good news/Bad news" for this year- Hoggard High School made growth, we exceeded 80% proficient, and NO ABC bonus! We did our jobs! We taught our kids! Now it's time to do what you can to reward teachers in the state of North Carolina or at least offer a way for people to honor teachers!

Don't think this idea is going away! 
Larry Volk

Subject: Teacher Bonus

Thank you for contacting my office. I have talked with all the parties
that were included in your email list to make sure I could provide a
full answer to your inquiry.

It is correct that legislative action would be necessary to change the
distribution formula of lottery monies. The current recipients of funds
were set by statute when the lottery was initially approved. All parties
indicated that your idea had merit, thus I will use the interim to
discuss it's potential with other members and the lottery officials on
the operational aspects of creating a new game.

I do appreciate the input and understand the urgency of the request due
to current economic conditions but it is not feasible to create a
program such as this, build support for it, and then move through the
legislative process in such a short time. That is primarily due to rules
of the senate that stated all legislation had to be introduced for
consideration back in April and meet a crossover deadline to move bills
to the House of May 14.

Thanks again for the suggestion and I will certainly keep under
consideration on my agenda for the 2010 session. More importantly thank
you for you service to the citizens of New Hanover County and your
commitment to educating our young people. We are all frustrated and it
is a painful duty to have to make the tough decisions facing us. The
budget has progressed this week as the House has got their version on
the floor for a vote and there are new revenues being discussed so that
the drastic cuts on the table may be mitigated to a large degree. I do
not agree with undercutting the pay and professional status of teachers
but I realize reality it going to strike all of us.

--Senator Julia Boseman

Governor Perdue, Lt. Gov. Dalton, Senator Boseman, and Ms. Garland

Let me tell you what Friday was like for the teachers I know. They took
between $100 and $380 cut in one paycheck. In shock, Stunned, It was
like they were punched! I, and they, know all about the reasons with the
state budget but as a few teachers put it: "Well now I know how the
state values my contract for the 2008-2009 school year!" another "What
would happen if I withheld part of my taxes because I'd overspent my
credit cards at Christmas?"

Ok, now on to a way to make teacher feel appreciated- because if you do
not pick them up now 2009-2010 will not be good!

This is what I have gathered from email correspondence with all of you.
Keep in mind Im just a simple teacher with an idea!
1. I sent Gov. Perdue an idea for a "North Carolina Teachers' Bonus"
related to the Lottery.
2. Gov. Perdue's office thought enough of the idea to pass it on to Ms.
Garland (NC Lottery). I will assume this was a positive idea passed on.
3. Ms. Garland took her valuable time to iron out some of the problems
and policies related to the idea. The percentages needed for each
component including promotion.
4. I responded with a breakdown that, in my mind, could make this work.
I even included a way to pick numbers playing off the state ABCs.
5. Ms. Garland correctly suggested that it was the legislature that made
these decisions so I sent the information to Ms. Boseman. I know this
process takes time and I am being so impatient but I would guess none of
you were in a school Friday listening to a new teacher say- "
The pay was low enough! If this happens just before summer why should I
come back?"
6. Between the four of you and the offices you run you have the power to
make this happen in a way that could be cost neutral! Right now the
teachers of North Carolina need and deserve this uplifting action.

*attached are the emails that are refereed to in this email!

So please, if this is not done soon, explain why not to a simple teacher
that deserved better than I got from the state this year.

North Carolina Teachers deserve better and if the four of you can not
pull this off then .....

Frustrated and tried

Subject: My two cents worth

Comment: Govenor Perdue, I understand that the state is in financial trouble. So am I and so are we, the working teachers of North Carolina. I have given up a percentage of my pay as a state employee (mind you I didn't become a teacher for the money in the first place but a person has to live), my ABC money for making adequate yearly progress for the first time in a while (without fully funded programs), my insurance has gone up (thank god I still have some coverage)and I am paying higher prices and getting less for them and we don't even have the money in the school budget for ample paper and ink to do business (that is required by state and federal mandates: I am a special ed teacher and I have to make copies of IEP's...). I would like to know, other than teachers, who else has given up so much of their pay in order to balance the budget? I also want to know if we consider the future to be a good investment? If so we need to do something about funding the preparation of our future (EDUCATION). Thank you for your time and consideration of my questions. Sincerely Carolyn Dent

Subject: New State Teachers Health Care Plan

Comment: I am a school teacher in Cumberland County. I have previously selected the 90/10 option, and when that became unavailable, chose the 80/20 plan. As I read the current plan choices, if I don't meet certain requirements set forth by...whom?...I may be FORCED to a lower level of coverage than I CHOOSE to have? Also, I see that routine eye exams are no longer covered. I guess the eyesight of your teachers is no longer a major concern. You've cut our pay, told us to take furlough time without pay at times convenient to you (not when it would be convenient for us), and now reduce our health coverage. Someone needs to take another look at where to make cuts. Your teachers have had enough.

Communicating to first responders and the public in an emergency is critical. How do you use effective emergency communications to prepare, respond and recover?

It's not easy, given the increasing demand from the public, who want to know what you know immediately, regardless of the type and severity of the emergency.

Then thereís the matter of interoperable communications. How do you communicate with neighboring communities and different law enforcement agencies when the situation affects multiple cities and counties?

Those questions--and more--will be answered in American City & County magazineís webinar sponsored by Cooper Notification. Our panel of city and county emergency management experts will provide case histories and best practices and answer your questions about this critical subject.

Learn how to:

* Engage your community from business to residents
* Reach different audiences from teenagers to the elderly
* Coordinate safety and security efforts among different government agencies, including interoperable communications between 58 law enforcement agencies during the 2009 Presidential Inauguration
* Utilize your emergency communications system for multi-use applications such as crime alerting
* Find grants for emergency communication systems

Subject: Budget Cuts in School Systems

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am writing in regards to a personal situation concerning my employment lay-off in Rutherford County, North Carolina school system due to the "Budget Cuts", in August of 2009. I realize that I am not the only person that has had this type of hardship, but please help me understand, WHY? WHY did the cut-backs BEGIN in the classrooms? I was employed for 9 years as a Kindergarten Assistant. I was involved in ALL classroom activities along with the teacher and teaching with or without the teacher. Our community "Cliffside" is a small low-income area; this in itself should tell you what type families and children that we care for. We treat the children as if they were our own. Whatever the need may it be mental, physical or spiritual we are there for them. It is not just a paycheck to me. I was a dedicated Teacher Assistant and was there to try and help make a difference. I and many other Teacher Assistants in our county were "Grandfathered In" due to the "No Child Left Behind Act". We were told that to secure our jobs we needed to take a couple of college courses through our local community college and a "Work Keys Test" at our county office. At the time we were notified about our job lay-off we were assured by our county office spokesperson that when or if jobs became available that we would be first to be called back. NOW, our county office has told me that if I was one of the ones that had been "Grandfathered In" and laid-off that they WERE NOT honoring this agreement. That I was NOT QUALIFIED for the positions. I have a problem with that statement and it was a slap in the face. I feel that 9 plus years of hands-on involvement in the classrooms is HIGHLY QUALIFIED! I am a dedicated Teacher Assistant and took my job very seriously. I felt each day that I had modeling clay in my hands and it was my job to mold, make and impress these children while they were in my care each day. Children thrive on the attention they receive for some children school is the only place they feel safe and secure. To have only one teacher in the classroom cannot effectively reach and help 22 plus children. With the extra help from the Teacher Assistant plays a crucial part in helping to reach these children. We are there to not only to support the teacher, but to help with educating, some with one on one help. Removing Teacher Assistants from the classroom, I feel is an injustice not only to the Assistant, but to the teacher and most of all the children. I feel YOU ARE "LEAVING CHILDREN BEHIND". More children will fall through the cracks due to the lack of extra help given to them. They need to know that they can count on someone and that someone cares about them and their future. Getting back to the "cutbacks". As per our County Office I now have to somehow go back to school to receive an Associate of Arts degree in ANY AREA or get 48 Semester Credit hours in order to be considered for any jobs posted. In "ANY AREA" doesn't make sense. I am putting my son through college and my daughter will be going to college in a couple of years. I don't feel it is fair to my children to take away the money and time from them to put myself in college. I don't qualify for help and cannot afford to do it myself. I was laid-off! Although, I do have my License in Cosmetology, which is an Associate of Science degree and 18 college semester credit hours and 6 of them are toward "Early Childhood Education" and 9 plus years of hands on experience and I was told by our County Office that it was unacceptable and that I wasn't QUALIFIED, but in the AA it can be in ANY AREA? I am thankful though that I am back working "Part-time" as a tutor in a 4th grade class. I do feel I am contributing to our future generation in a small way, but the fact remains that my benefits, such as my insurance, my children's insurance, my retirement, 401K, and most of all my STABILITY! Please review the actions of all budget cuts and the effect they have had on the school systems and ALL their employees. Keep in mind that "Schools" are not only a school. It is a house/home for many children and their safe zone. All that work in the schoolHOUSE/home are considered "Foster/Parents/Teachers and we need to keep all our dedicated Foster Parents/Teachers and Assistants at home/school to fulfill the needs, hopes and dreams of our children of the future. Mrs. Perdue if there is anything possible that you can do to help my situation and that of others please do so. I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you. Sincerely, Sara Ledsome

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am one of your constituents and I am also someone who cares
deeply about the future of education in the United States. I am
writing to urge you to standardize pre-k teaching credentials in
our state.

Each state has many standards in place to ensure that
credentialed teachers meet certain requirements and receive
on-going education. The same standard is not upheld for pre-k
teachers; many are not required to have bachelor's degrees or
early-childhood development training.

Numerous research studies have shown that a Bachelor's degree is
the minimum necessary for teachers to provide high-quality pre-k
education, yet Rhode Island is the only state that requires one
from all of its early education teachers. Research has also
shown that children in pre-k programs (especially at-risk
children) are more likely to be successful in school and in
life.

Better qualified instructors will lead to brighter students--and
brighter students will lead to a better and stronger future for
our country.

Thank you so much for your time.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am one of your constituents and I am also someone who cares
deeply about the future of education in the United States. I am
writing to urge you to standardize pre-k teaching credentials in
our state.

Each state has many standards in place to ensure that
credentialed teachers meet certain requirements and receive
on-going education. The same standard is not upheld for pre-k
teachers; many are not required to have bachelor's degrees or
early-childhood development training.

Numerous research studies have shown that a Bachelor's degree is
the minimum necessary for teachers to provide high-quality pre-k
education, yet Rhode Island is the only state that requires one
from all of its early education teachers. Research has also
shown that children in pre-k programs (especially at-risk
children) are more likely to be successful in school and in
life.

Better qualified instructors will lead to brighter students--and
brighter students will lead to a better and stronger future for
our country.

Thank you so much for your time.


Sincerely,
Carol Soroos

education, yet Rhode Island is the only state that requires one
from all of its early education teachers. Research has also
shown that children in pre-k programs (especially at-risk
children) are more likely to be successful in school and in
life.

Better qualified instructors will lead to brighter students--and
brighter students will lead to a better and stronger future for
our country.

Thank you so much for your time.


Sincerely,

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am one of your constituents and I am also someone who cares
deeply about the future of education in the United States. I am
writing to urge you to standardize pre-k teaching credentials in
our state.

Each state has many standards in place to ensure that
credentialed teachers meet certain requirements and receive
on-going education. The same standard is not upheld for pre-k
teachers; many are not required to have bachelor's degrees or
early-childhood development training.

Numerous research studies have shown that a Bachelor's degree is
the minimum necessary for teachers to provide high-quality pre-k
education, yet Rhode Island is the only state that requires one
from all of its early education teachers. Research has also
shown that children in pre-k programs (especially at-risk
children) are more likely to be successful in school and in
life.

Better qualified instructors will lead to brighter students--and
brighter students will lead to a better and stronger future for
our country.

Thank you so much for your time.
