Subject: [Aid4Mail Trial tag #4899] [BAILOUT 26]  Another endorsement for Single Payer Healthcare!!

[BAILOUT 26]  North Carolina endorses Single Payer Healthcare!!

> Be it Further resolved, that the State Executive Committee of the North Carolina Democratic Party directs Party Chairman David Young to instruct Senator Kay Hagan, Representatives G.K. Butterfield NC-1, Bob Etheridge NC-2, David Price NC-4, Mike McIntyre NC-7, Larry Kissell NC-8, Heath Shuler NC-11, Mel Watt NC-12, and Brad Miller NC-13 that the North Carolina Democratic Party and its members – in the absence of Single-Payer as a choice -- strongly support a robust Public Option as an alternative and expect their Congressional Representatives to make a robust Public Option mandatory; and

> Be it Further resolved, that Chairman David Young conveys to Senator Hagan and our Democratic Congressional House Representatives that a bill without at least a Public Option is not acceptable to the Democratic Party of North Carolina and its members and urges our Congressional delegation to vote against any health care reform bill that does not contain a robust Public Option.



.
On Saturday, Aug 29th, over 600 Democratic Party Representatives from across NC met as their semi-annual State Executive Committee in Charlotte, and voted on various guidelines for the next 6 months.
.
Here are their Priorities regarding Healthcare Reform, sent as instructions to NC's Democratic Congressional Delegation of 1 Senator and 8 House Members (9 Dems out of 15)
.
Priority One:  Universal Single Payer Healthcare if available.
.
Priority Two:  If Single Payer is unavailable, then Public Option.
.
Priority Three:  If neither are available, vote for NO Healthcare Reform Bill at all.
_______________________________
.
Why were Instructions from the Democratic Party to NC's Congressional Delegation stated in this way?  For several reasons related to similar concerns found among Democrats in other States across America.
.
1)  Freshman US Senator Kay Hagen, who as a State Senator sided often with Corporate interests, and who owns stock in Healthcare Corporations, originally staked herself out as a major blocker to the Public Option in her position on the Senate HELP Committee, which she was elected by the Healthcare Industry to do.  She thought because she would not have to face voters for 5 1/2 more years, she was home-free.  
.
When Hagan got so much flack from her NC constituents for pulling such a trick, she issued some political double-speak, pretending to support a Public Option, after being assured that it had virtually no chance of remaining in the final Bill.  Therefore, she had stated her position to her Healthcare Industry Managers loud and clear, then pretended to reverse herself for the voters back home, believing she would never have to vote on a Bill which contained a Public Option. 
.
2)  Tho Blue Dog Democrats exist formally only in the House, Hagan has proven that she sides with them quite comfortably. Senators like Hagan are often referred to as DINOs:  Democrats In Name Only.   
.
Blue Dog Dems consist of 51 specific House Members.  Two of  8 NC Democratic Reps have signed up as Blue Dogs, being Mike McIntyre of 7th District in far eastern NC, and Heath Schuler of District 11 in far western NC.  Schuler is also the Whip of Blue Dog Dems. <http://www.house.gov/melancon/BlueDogs/Member%20Page.html>http://www.house.gov/melancon/BlueDogs/Member%20Page.html
.
Blue Dog Dems were foolishly supported with funding by the National Party in Conservative Districts in order to defeat Republicans to help assure a majority in the House.  However, Blue Dogs have reneged on the President several times, including Schuler voting against the Stimulus Package, and all Blue Dogs opposing Global Warming Legislation, and Healthcare Reform, two most important weapons in the arsenal to bring Corporate America under control.
.
Blue Dog Dems are in fact RethugliCONs hiding out in Democratic disguise. Arkansas Blue Dog Dem Mike Ross, who earns $100,000 per month from the Corporate Healthcare Mafia, has been a major player in derailing the Public Option. <http://messenger.truthout.org/ss/link.php?M=96386&N=216&C=fb975cf26e3a84d9f44f6b8350d7a999&L=1971>http://www.truthout.org/082809B?n 
______________________________
.
3) But the main reason Congressional Delegations across America are being instructed by their State Democratic Parties in similar ways is this: An alternative Bill to butchered HR 3200 with it's ailing Public Option ALREADY exists.  What the NC Democratic Party instructed it's Delegation to vote for is this:  <http://www.pnhp.org/publications/united_states_national_health_care_act_hr_676.php>united_states_national_health_care_act_hr_676 
.
And why would they do that?  Because President Obama is about to pull Br'er Rabbit out of his Uncle Remus Hat!
.
All during July Markups in Committees, and now during Teabagger Scream-fests across America during the August Recess, Democrats have been singing out loud and clear to RethugliCONs, Lobbyists, Healthcare Corporate Murderers, and Blue Dog Dems this same message:  
.
You can beat us up, you can yell and scream at us, you can say we're idiots, but whatever you do, don't throw us into the Briar Patch!
.
And what is the Briar Patch?  The Briar Patch is <http://www.pnhp.org/publications/united_states_national_health_care_act_hr_676.php>HR 676: Single Payer Universal Healthcare, which was intentionally kept off the table while HR 3200 was butchered and mangled, a sacrificial goat to keep <http://www.pnhp.org/publications/united_states_national_health_care_act_hr_676.php>HR 676 safe.  House Speaker Pelosie has already promised <http://www.pnhp.org/publications/united_states_national_health_care_act_hr_676.php>HR 676 will be brought to the House Floor for a vote as a substitute for HR 3200: <http://www.healthcare-now.org/campaigns/pass-single-payer/>Rep Weiner's Single Payer Amendment to be brought to House floor in September
.
Knowing that Big Pharma, HMOs, Health Insurance Lobbyists, Teabagger Screamers and every other form of slime would crawl out from under rocks all across America -- spending billions of dollars to cripple any Healthcare Bill brought out for discussion -- Healthcare Reform Strategists decided to let them butcher HR 3200 and companion Bills in the Senate as much as their greedy, corrupt little hearts desired, spending their billions for nothing.
_______________________________
A demented RethugliCON Senator from SC claims that defeating Obama's Healthcare Reform will crash all Change that Obama hopes to accomplish during his Administration.
.
Pulling Br'er Rabbit (aka <http://www.pnhp.org/publications/united_states_national_health_care_act_hr_676.php>HR 676) out of a hat will not only secure truly "affordable" Healthcare for every American, but it shall also break the back of any RethugliCON Corporate Swindle of America for a long, long time to come.
.
It's up to us!  When Congress Critters come back from Recess after Labor Day, they MUST know to the bottom of their hearts and souls that the vast majority of Americans want Universal Single Payer Healthcare.  
.
Sing it out.  Sing it out loud and clear: from sea to shining sea.  <http://www.pnhp.org/publications/united_states_national_health_care_act_hr_676.php>HR 676 NOW!
_______________________________
.
Ironic footnote: the Henderson County (NC) Democratic Party in Blue Dog Dem Heath Schuler's District is selling bumperstickers:  HEALTHCARE FOR EVERYONE . The ONLY bill that provides Healthcare for EVERYONE is HR 676, Universal Single Payer Healthcare for all Americans!

Subject: Screening the President

Comment: Is Governor Perdue aware that a message has been sent out by the Chief Academic Officer of NCDIP to all NC school systems screening the President's motivational (not political) speech to students? Also, that some principals have required teachers to get written permission from parents for their students' participation? And that those principals have told their teachers they are REQUIRED to provide alternate activities if parents don't want their child to participate? As a former teacher, I am appalled! This is the President of our country! Our children daily pledge allegiance to the flag, and the republic. Certainly our President is the most obvious symbol of our country and his message to students to achieve should NOT be optional.

Remember 2010 is not too far..... WE WILL NOT stand for any additional taxes and undue debts.

We do need healthcare reform, but the remedy needs to be studied and not crammed down our throats.

Anyone who will help, will be remembered....

Over the past year the Transportation Security Administration has continued to install hundreds of Advanced Technology X-Ray systems at the nation's airports and soon hopes to take further advantage of what those platforms have to offer by introducing the capability to detect liquids. In addition, the agency has expanded its ongoing pilot testing of millimeter wave-based Whole Body Imaging systems to include primary screening at the checkpoint.

Several companies have contracts from TSA to further develop their high-speed Explosive Detection Systems that will include fixed-gantries. What may TSA be thinking in terms of the development of the new high-speed EDS versus continued upgrades to existing EDS technology that is increasing the throughput of these machines? Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate continues to investigate ways to do stand-off detection for explosives, seeking ways to speed passenger throughput at checkpoints. The S&T branch is also exploring ways to improve the software in EDS, including the use of third-parties who could possibly enhance explosive detection through the development of new software algorithms.

* What may TSA have planned for advancing the capabilities of its AT X-Ray systems?
*  What may be TSA and DHS be learning about the use of Whole Body Imaging systems in both primary and secondary screening roles and what may be ahead for this and similar technology?
*  What else is TSA doing at the checkpoint to improve its capabilities to detect weapons and explosives?
*  What has DHS S&T learned about doing stand-off detection and what lies ahead?
*  How is DHS S&T helping to improve the capabilities of AT X-Ray and EDS systems and what help does it need from industry?
Defense Daily's newest interactive webinar will delve into these questions and more. Including your questions to the speakers.

ED REVIEW

September 4, 2009



...a bi-weekly update on U.S. Department of Education activities relevant to the Intergovernmental and Corporate community and other stakeholders

______________________________________________________________________

BACK TO SCHOOL



In a recent letter to school principals, Secretary Duncan announced that, on Tuesday, September 8, at 12:00 noon ET, President Obama will deliver a national address directly to students on the importance of education.  (Note: The time of this speech has changed from 1:00 p.m. ET.)  The President will challenge students to work hard, set educational goals, and take responsibility for their learning.  He will also call for a shared responsibility and commitment on the part of students, parents, and educators to ensure that every child in every school gets the best education possible, so he or she can compete in the global economy for good jobs and live rewarding and productive lives as citizens.  The 15 to 20 minute address will be broadcast live (as well as archived) on the White House web site (<http://www.whitehouse.gov/live/>http://www.whitehouse.gov/live/) and C-SPAN.  Furthermore, the Department is offering educators a menu of classroom activities -- created by its Teaching Ambassador Fellows -- to engage students in the address and stimulate classroom discussions about the importance of education.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/academic/bts.html>http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/academic/bts.html.



To encourage student engagement, the Department is also launching the “I Am What I Learn” video contest.  On September 8, students will be asked to respond to the President’s challenge by creating videos describing the steps they will take to improve their education and the role education will play in fulfilling their dreams.  All students age 13 and older are asked to create and upload their videos to YouTube by October 8; entries may be in the form of video blogs, public service announcements, music videos, or documentaries.  The general public will then vote on their favorites -- to determine the top 20 finalists.  These 20 videos will be reviewed by a panel of judges, including Secretary Duncan.  The panel will select three winners, each of whom will receive a $1,000 prize.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.ed.gov/iamwhatilearn/>http://www.ed.gov/iamwhatilearn/.



And don’t forget!  The next “Education News Parents Can Use” broadcast (September 15, 8:00-9:00 p.m. ET) will feature Secretary Duncan in a special town hall meeting, subtitled “America Goes Back to School.”  Since May, the Secretary has been traveling throughout the country to engage a broad group of stakeholders -- including parents -- in an open and honest conversation about federal education policy in anticipation of the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act.  Already, he has met with hundreds of students, parents, teachers, principals, education support staff, superintendents, professors, higher education administrators, and community leaders during his tour: “Listening and Learning: A Conversation About Education Reform” (see <http://www.edgovblogs.org/duncan/topic/listening-tour/>http://www.edgovblogs.org/duncan/topic/listening-tour/).  Now, for his latest tour “stop,” he will engage in a live, interactive discussion via telephone, email, and video and with a studio audience.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.ed.gov/edtv/>http://www.ed.gov/edtv/.

______________________________________________________________________

H1N1 FLU VIRUS



On August 24, Secretary Duncan joined Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, District of Columbia Mayor Adrian Fenty, and District of Columbia Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee to announce new recommendations on the continuity of learning in the event of student absences or school closures due to seasonal or novel H1N1 flu.  “We can all work to keep ourselves healthy now by practicing prevention, close monitoring, and using common sense,” Duncan said.  “We know that some students may be affected by H1N1.  And our top priority is making sure that they have a way to get well, stay well, and to keep learning.  With these recommendations, we’re providing strategies for educators to help ensure that the learning process will continue.”  The recommendations suggest that educators prepare take-home assignments in advance for distribution to affected students and use the Internet and telephones to post homework materials, conduct classes, share information, and keep students, parents, and teachers in close touch.  The Department is working with Apple, Curriki, Google, the International Association for Online Learning, Microsoft, Pearson, Scholastic, and other private sector parties to make continuity of learning resources (such as conference call services, webinar support, and virtual classrooms) more accessible and affordable.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/emergencyplan/pandemic/guidance/continuity-recs.pdf>http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/emergencyplan/pandemic/guidance/continuity-recs.pdf AND <http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/emergencyplan/pandemic/guidance/continuity-qa.pdf>http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/emergencyplan/pandemic/guidance/continuity-qa.pdf.



The Department has also issued new guidance to help prepare states, school districts, schools, and institutions of higher education in the event of an outbreak of the H1N1 flu virus during the school year.  In general, this guidance discusses waivers and some other forms of relief from federal education requirements that may provide entities with the operational flexibility necessary to efficiently close schools and, otherwise, respond to the administrative challenges presented by an H1N1 outbreak (such as prolonged school closures, excessive absenteeism, and other disruptions in the regular delivery of education services).  This guidance only covers federal education requirements.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/emergencyplan/pandemic/guidance/flexibility-and-waivers.doc>http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/emergencyplan/pandemic/guidance/flexibility-and-waivers.doc.



Later this morning, the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will release new guidance for child care facilities to plan for and respond to the upcoming flu season.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.flu.gov/>http://www.flu.gov/ AND <http://www.ed.gov/h1n1flu/>http://www.ed.gov/h1n1flu/.

ARRA OUTREACH



Last week, the Secretary announced the publication in the Federal Register of draft requirements for $3.5 billion in Title I School Improvement Grants to turn-around the nation’s lowest-performing schools.  Title I School Improvement grants are funded by $546 million in the Fiscal Year 2009 appropriations and $3 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The Secretary is required to award grants to each state based on the proportional share of funds it receives under Title I.  Each state must provide subgrants to school districts that apply for funds and have demonstrated the greatest commitment to serve their Title I schools currently identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).  The Administration’s strategy includes: identifying and serving the lowest-achieving Title I schools in each state; supporting only the most rigorous interventions that hold the promise of producing rapid improvements in student achievement and school culture; providing sufficient resources over several years to implement those interventions; and measuring progress in achieving results.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2009/08/08262009.html>http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2009/08/08262009.html.



This week -- the same week it released the second half of ARRA Title I, IDEA, and Vocational Rehabilitation funding 30 days ahead of schedule (see <http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2009/08/08032009.html>http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2009/08/08032009.html) -- the Department released new guidance on the use of ARRA Title I, Part A, and IDEA, Parts B and C, funds to strengthen education, drive reform, and improve results for students.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/recovery/guidance/titlei-reform.pdf>http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/recovery/guidance/titlei-reform.pdf, <http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/recovery/guidance/idea-b-reform.pdf>http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/recovery/guidance/idea-b-reform.pdf, <http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/recovery/guidance/idea-c-reform.pdf>http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/recovery/guidance/idea-c-reform.pdf, AND <http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/recovery/guidance/titlei-idea-useoffunds.ppt>http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/recovery/guidance/titlei-idea-useoffunds.ppt.



Meanwhile, the Department has developed tip sheets to assist recipients in completing ARRA recipient reporting at <http://www.federalreporting.gov/>http://www.federalreporting.gov/.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/recovery/section-1512.html>http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/recovery/section-1512.html.

STATEMENT ON SENATOR KENNEDY



The Secretary issued the following statement on the passing of Senator Edward Kennedy:



“Senator Kennedy was a tireless agent of change on behalf of the American people.  His passing marks a great loss for both the United States Senate and the nation.  He dedicated his life in public service to ensuring fairness and opportunity for all people.  I drew inspiration from Senator Kennedy throughout my career and will miss his voice as a champion of education reform.  My wife, Karen, and I extend our prayers and condolences to the Kennedy family, especially with Senator Kennedy’s wife, Vicki, and with Kara, Teddy Jr., and Patrick.”

______________________________________________________________________

KIDS FOR KING



On August 25, the Secretary joined the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation on the National Mall to commemorate the 46th anniversary of the March on Washington and officially launch the Kids for King Education Initiative.  “We must never forget the progress that Dr. King inspired in civil rights and social justice, and we must recognize how much work is still ahead of us,” he said.  “With high school dropout rates unacceptably high and college completion rates far too low, education is clearly the civil rights issue of this generation.  Every child and adult deserves a high-quality education.  This is the only lasting way to fuel our economic recovery and end the stubborn cycles of poverty and social failure.”  The Kids for King Education Initiative (<http://www.kidsforking.org/>http://www.kidsforking.org/) invites youth from grades 3-12 to write an essay, create a piece of art, or produce a short video about the lasting legacy of Dr. King and his ideals of democracy, justice, hope, and love.  The program also contains a lesson plan for parents and teachers to educate youth about Dr. King; three lesson plans have been developed, including plans for grades 3-5, grades 6-8, and grades 9-12.  The year-long program will culminate in fall 2010, when nine students will win a trip to Washington, D.C., to participate in a live press event on the National Mall.  A memorial honoring Dr. King will be built on the Mall, adjacent to the FDR Memorial and in direct line between the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials.  The foundation has raised $106 million out of the needed $120 million to build the memorial.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2009/08/08252009b.html>http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2009/08/08252009b.html.

ODDS AND ENDS



·         The National Center for Education Statistics’ Back to School Forecast notes more students are entering and returning to America’s schools and colleges than ever before.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372>http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372.

·         The Department has published in the Federal Register a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposing to implement general and non-loan provisions that were added to the Higher Education Act, as amended by the Higher Education Opportunity Act.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2009/gen-program.html>http://www.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2009/gen-program.html.

·         Under the ARRA, more students and parents will qualify over the next two years for a tax credit to pay for college expenses.  The American Opportunity Credit modifies the existing Hope Credit for tax years 2009 and 2010, making it available to a broader range of taxpayers, including many with higher incomes and those who owe no tax.  It also adds “required course materials” to the list of qualifying expenses and allows the credit to be claimed for four postsecondary education years, versus two.  Many of those eligible will qualify for the maximum annual credit of $2,500 per student.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=205674,00.html>http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=205674,00.html.

·         The Census in Schools program promotes data literacy and increases awareness of Census Bureau products and activities by providing educators with teaching tools, resource materials, workshops, and other professional development opportunities.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.census.gov/dmd/www/teachers.html>http://www.census.gov/dmd/www/teachers.html.

·         On a long-term basis, students’ SAT mathematics scores have experienced an upward trend and are now four points higher than a decade ago.  Conversely, students’ SAT reading scores have declined somewhat and are now four points below what they were a decade ago.  As in past years, the strongest SAT performers on average had three things in common: they had completed a core curriculum, had taken their school’s most rigorous courses, and had familiarized themselves with the test.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.collegeboard.com/press/releases/206201.html>http://www.collegeboard.com/press/releases/206201.html.

QUOTE TO NOTE



“I often hear that managing the multiple missions of higher education, today, is akin to being caught in an ‘iron triangle.’  Every college president and every governing board wants to simultaneously improve quality, increase access -- and yet constrain costs.  To college executives, these three sides of the iron triangle often seem like mutually conflicting choices.  Elevating quality raises costs.  Increasing access can dilute quality.  And, reducing costs impairs both quality and access.  In the standard formulation, the only way out of the iron triangle is to secure unlimited resources, either in the form of bigger endowments or state and federal support.  Now, the tension between these three goals is real -- and I don’t question for a minute that boosting resources for higher education is essential….  At the same time, I don’t think that more resources alone are the answer to the challenges facing higher education….  A more promising long-term solution for breaking out of the iron triangle is to have college presidents and administrators make better and more imaginative use of efficiency, productivity improvements, and accountability.”



-- Secretary of Education Arne Duncan (9/2/09), speaking at the National HBCU Conference

UPCOMING EVENTS



On September 14, the Department will hold its next web conference designed to assist grantees and subgrantees in managing ARRA grants.  The topic is the new Title I and IDEA use of funds guidance.  Remember, previous conferences (on fraud prevention, completing Section 1512 quarterly reports, and cash management) are archived for review.

Health Reform Rallies, Interim Planning & New Publications

September 4, 2009

Dear Beverly,

Action for Children in the interim
As you know, the 2009 legislative session has ended. The N.C. General Assembly will reconvene on May 12, 2010. Action for Children will be working hard during the interim to move our action items forward:
* Health Insurance for All Children: We will continue to work for health insurance reform on the federal level, while urging our state leaders to put more funding towards N.C. Health Choice, in order to cover more of North Carolina's children.
*  Juvenile Justice: We will be working with stakeholders (policymakers, advocates, communities and families) to continue moving forward on our Raise the Age campaign, through community forums, fact sheets and issue briefs, meetings with key leaders and more.
*  Economic Security: We will be providing technical assistance to the N.C. Financial Literacy Council and holding community forums around the state to get community input on asset development policies to help build an assets agenda for the state in 2010.
*  Tracking Budget Cuts: We will be tracking the 2009 budget cuts as they are implemented over the course of the year in health and human services and juvenile justice to ensure that policymakers, advocates and the public are aware of the impacts of these cuts.
 Action for Children will keep you updated on our work in preparation for the next legislative session in 2010! For a review of the 2009 session, visit Action for Children's <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1102691117478&s=367&e=001-suRcrH2HAvgugHT4HSm-UYLUfXQs0xSvlicsKuTECwLpp99AB4PJ8sI4sgyNlD6e3DVI9q-t4OiVcE4ycYnmiwQUWGdx5ztYnQBaL0qDqBI1blm-jtv2iinXmHVpROis0C-8H7MGU8NBJFOCUjp8whOU7oaiNKOBDy0QWjI0mw=>state policy page.

New Report! 2009 Portrait of Adolescent Health in North Carolina
This first-ever portrait of the health of adolescents in North Carolina finds that many adolescents benefit from strong community connections -- 2 out of 3 are in engaged in extracurricular activities, a quarter of them volunteer, and more than half of registered 18- to 24-year-olds voted in the last presidential election.

However, the report also finds that North Carolina's adolescents face significant challenges in accessing health care and establishing and maintaining relationships with their families, schools, and communities. This lack of a strong foundation and community connections undermines decision-making and facilitates unhealthy behaviors that can lead to poor health outcomes in adolescence and well into adulthood.

GRACIE’ JOURNEY TO HER EAR by her mother Mary











My beautiful daughter who was born with Hemifacial Microsomia. The day Graci was born was the happiest day of my life. She came into this world just as I had imagined....beautiful!!! She was diagnosed with having over 6 craniofacial birth defects all on one side of her face.

She has already undergone four surgeries to correct her cleft lip and cleft palate. She was also born with microtia which wasn't noted on the ultrasound so it was a complete shock to my husband and I. Microtia is a birth defect of the ear. It is where the ear didn't form properly in the womb causing her to be born with only the ear lope. She can't hear out of that ear and it looks quite different from the other ear. It has been very difficult dealing with that for the past six years but with God's Grace and strength we have overcome every frustration and trial that has come our way.

We have now reached the point where she is having ear reconstruction. She has already had the first stage where we traveled to California to see Dr. Burt Brent who is a plastic surgeon who only does ear reconstruction. He actually craves the ear from the child's very own rib cartilage causing it to grow as they grow. It is amazing what he has already done and we are so excited to have gotten this process started. She will have four more surgeries over the next year before her ear is complete.

The sad thing to this story is that insurance has denied Graci her ear. She deserves an ear like her brother and she has always wanted "two matching ears". My family will make this dream come true for her regardless of the expense.

However, we live in such a caring and thoughtful community that may organizations, families, businesses have already given to Graci's Ear Fund. I can't express my gratitude enough to everyone for their thoughts and prayers during this challenge. God has a plan for Graci and it is getting her what she deserves.

I ask you to join us as we journey through this amazing journey watching a brave little girl get her ear she has been dreaming of!!!

Crucial Conversation Luncheon: featuring Wendell Potter

Tuesday September 22, 2009



Wendell Potter is one of the nation's most prominent spokespersons for national health care reform. He is a Senior Fellow on Health Care at the national nonprofit advocacy group, the Center for Media and Democracy. After a 20-year career as a corporate public relations executive, last year he left his job as head of communications for one of the nation's largest health insurers to try his hand at helping socially responsible organizations - including those advocating for meaningful health care reform - achieve their goals. He has testified before Congress, appeared on a variety of national television and radio programs and was profiled in a recent column by Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times entitled "Health Care Fit for Animals."



Please join us for this very special NC Policy Watch Crucial Conversation luncheon-

BRAC Budget Reform Commission Meets, Launches New Webpage

Gov. Perdue on Tuesday convened the first meeting of the Budget Reform and Accountability Commission (BRAC) and launched a new Webpage, <http://brac.nc.gov>brac.nc.gov, so that citizens may make recommendations to the commission.

“As North Carolina continues to be deeply affected by this national recession, state government must ensure that every tax dollar is used as efficiently and wisely as possible,” Perdue said.  “I look forward to working with BRAC members to meet these challenges head-on, without shying away from politically tough decisions.”

Perdue established BRAC in January via <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=429>Executive Order #5 to locate and eliminate wasteful expenditures while increasing efficiency in government.

In the short term, the commission is expected to come up with ideas that can be enacted quickly to help the state save money.  Its goal will be to have recommendations in time for next year’s legislative short session.

In the long term, BRAC will examine state government and make innovative recommendations to:

• eliminate unnecessary or unsuccessful programs;
• consolidate where possible and ensure we are investing effectively and efficiently;
• and to streamline the way state government works.

Suggestions for initiatives that BRAC will consider may come from a variety of sources, including state agencies, BRAC members, and from the public at large.  The commission also urges citizens to make recommendations using the new Webpage, <http://brac.nc.gov>brac.nc.gov

Research encourages schools to create "child and family teams"

A study released Tuesday by NC State researchers finds that the formation of "child and family teams" (CFTs) may be extremely useful in helping young people who are having difficulty with grades or behavior become more engaged and do well in school and life.



Dr. Jocelyn Taliaferro, an associate professor of social work at NC State and co-author of the study, explains that a CFT "takes a 'village' approach. A child and his or her family decide who would be on the team - such as teachers, social workers, pastors or other community members - and then work with the team to develop a plan for helping the child succeed both in school and in the broader community. One advantage of this approach is that it removes the 'us versus them' mentality, by bringing in a broad support group and giving the child and family some control over the situation."



The study was funded by DPI and is and is being published online in the August issue of the journal Child and Family Social Work.

o       Ticket Express Events: Spreading the Word About the New Ticket to Work



o       Work Incentives Seminar Events (WISE): Helping Beneficiaries Make Informed Choices About Work!

Ticket Express Events:

The NEW Ticket to Work Program offers new opportunities to expand the scope of services and supports available to assist Social Security beneficiaries with disabilities who are interested in entering or re-entering the workforce. Administrative and regulatory improvements have made it easier and more profitable for Employment Networks (ENs) to participate in the Ticket program. ENs can get paid earlier in the employment process, more often and at higher rates. A new Partnership Plus service delivery option encourages State Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) agencies and ENs to partner to ensure that beneficiaries have access to services and supports to help them maintain and advance in employment.

 Ticket Express events provide information about the new Ticket program and how the new program can help grow your organization’s bottom line. If your organization is interested in becoming an EN or learning more about the Ticket program, a Ticket Express event will provide all the information you need to understand why and how to become an EN.  

WISE Events:

If you are a Social Security disability beneficiary and interested in working, the Social Security Administration and CESSI, the Ticket to Work Program Manager for Recruitment and Outreach (PMRO), want to make sure you are aware of upcoming free opportunities to connect with local training and employment resources, explore opportunities to increase your income, and network with other job seekers and employers. Local Work Incentive Planning and Assistance projects will be hosting 28 WISE events in 18 states in September.

 Visit <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1102692444892&s=2164&e=001Ot9N3T-EK-kkfgRI3BquJaALDtyrFcLHnk67tct928CjbvZFjmvXnoZopLhdy_63BoY_0MM8G-yf4rB4_4lm_m1tj_l1KY__5QlUQpjiIR9cpFU8UYUK6ZoRk9q4F2uT>http://www.ncafterschooltraining.com to view the Professional Development Training Database.   First-time users can download a "User's Guide," available on the website.

The database is a product of a statewide initiative led by NC CAP, NCSU 4-H Youth Development and the NC Afterschool Coalition over the past year.  Other member representation on the group includes the major public and private afterschool providers, state agencies, afterschool member associations, community college system, and the early childhood movement.  The group is working to create a comprehensive professional development system that will motivate afterschool staff to increase their level of education, and in turn, the level of quality care they provide. 

Among the group's initiatives is the development of tiered afterschool staff competencies, which are modeled after leading national examples, including the Mott Foundation, National Afterschool Association, US Military School-Age Competencies, and the Kansas/Missouri Statewide Afterschool Networks.  The group is collaborating with two and four-year colleges to infuse the staff competencies into school-age coursework, gather feedback from faculty, and create a formal statewide school-age certificate.  

 Upcoming work includes regional focus groups on the competencies at the October NCaeyc conference in Raleigh , as well as gathering additional feedback through online surveys, conference calls, and in-person meetings with afterschool staff and other stakeholders.

 Superintendent Reports on Afterschool Physical Activity Standards

During her monthly report to the State Board of Education, Superintendent June Atkinson praised the Move More Afterschool Collaborative for its work in developing physical activity standards for the state's afterschool programs. The Move More North Carolina: Recommended Standards for After-School Physical Activity provides guidelines for creating practices, policies and environments that support physical activity in afterschool programs. 

North Carolina is the first state to release recommended standards for physical activity in afterschool programs. The voluntary guidelines offer ways for afterschool programs to incorporate more physical activity - a growing concern for the state that ranks fifth nationally in childhood obesity.   

The standards were released at NC CAP's statewide conference in May.  For video footage of Dr. Robert Schwartz, NC Pediatric Association and Wake Forest University , presenting on "The Obesity Epidemic" or to view comments by NBC The Biggest Loser stars Heba Salama and Ed Brantley at SYNERGY, visit <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1102692444892&s=2164&e=001Ot9N3T-EK-lSPzQpOFJiyQ2qzs61F9XEZpmYpD7q_fgiMtdEISbrBM3TACR0-zec1oia2kZsMRw31B8OCm5XcdniERVoTMP6NVQjQTACbeRs1N6vfN_rUhRwH1wlrkenPqQB_6a3Lb4=>http://www.nccap.net/about/conference.cfm.

Afterschool & Youth Services Take Enormous Cuts

Cuts not only in the education budget but in the Departments of Health and Human Services and Juvenile Justice have dramatically cut services to young people and afterschool programs.  Some of the major impact areas on young people and their families include:

* The Support Our Students (SOS) and Governor's One-on-One Mentoring programs that provided afterschool programs for nearly 15,000 young people are eliminated.
* Eckerd Wilderness Camps are cut by $2.7m, including closure of 2 of the 7 camps.
* The Center for the Prevention of School Violence is eliminated.
* Smart Start, the program providing support services to pre-schoolers and their families is cut by $16 million.  In addition, Smart Start and other early childhood programs will be considered for consolidation by a task force.
* More at Four, the early education program for four-year-olds is cut $5 million
* Funding for school-based child and family support teams was cut $1.2 million.
In addition, other cutbacks, such as the elimination of 200 literacy coaches, directly impact the need for additional afterschool remediation and academic assistance for children and youth.  

The only bright spot in the budget comes from a $13m increase to the Dropout Prevention Grants, as well as the support of federal stimulus dollars, roughly $600 million of which were earmarked to help offset some, if not all, of the reductions in education funding. Those funds will greatly soften the impact of education cuts in this fiscal year and next. However, when the stimulus dollars end in two years, the General Assembly will be faced with a very large funding gap.

NC CAP Recruiting Afterschool Liaisons

NC CAP is recruiting liaisons for select counties to serve as a point of contact with local decision makers and disseminate information about NC CAP and the state of afterschool within the local community.  NC CAP will provide materials and resources for this one-year commitment.

Liaisons are needed for the following counties:  Alleghany, Anson, Beaufort, Bertie, Bladen, Burke, Caldwell, Chowan, Clay, Cleveland, Columbus, Edgecombe, Gates, Graham, Hertford, Hyde, Jones, Martin, Northampton, Richmond, Robeson, Rockingham, Rutherford, Surry, Tyrrell, Vance, Wayne, Wilkes, and Wilson.

To sign up, or for more information about the NC CAP liaison program, contact Katie Biggerstaff at (919) 781-6833, ext. 132 or <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1102692444892&s=2164&e=001Ot9N3T-EK-ntdjp4zCQ3kj8Y11kuszGLJ5ztxKPkU9s821y-kEPEVDnPZOiKyQeFDrr_74ftiOCQ2ShqdDlmT5l2gm7nSYvww6l3faDfNubCCjVHdmwpkg5aRFrpTUdatoOGILOhooW_kl8Fvl9kPQeps0EGGnlADHEKSx35SGEDfcKFKY-gRA==>kbiggerstaff@ncforum.org.

Freedom Schools A Growing Charlotte Initiative

Viccardo Streater was only in third grade, but was already failing in school when he spent a summer at a Freedom School in Charlotte . Viccardo is 15 now, and recently completed his sixth and final summer as a student at the Seigle Point Freedom School . He used to make Fs and is now making As and Bs.

"I was very unprepared for the world," he says. "I'm prepared now. They have taught me to do well in school and the world. Freedom School has changed me."

Success stories like Viccardo's explain why Foundation For The Carolinas President Michael Marsicano and Temple Beth El Rabbi Judy Schindler are among 200 community volunteers committed to helping the students during the summer and after-school programs that aim to encourage reading, self-worth and a love of learning.   

Over the past six years, Freedom Schools has expanded from 50 children to over 500, with goals to reach 5,000, following requests from community partners for the additional need.

The schools are a creation of Marian Wright Edelman's Children's Defense Fund, which collaborated with local organizations to launch the schools. In Charlotte , Seigle Avenue Partners has taken on this role.  The afterschool programs have become such a big part of what Seigle does that it plans to change its name to Freedom School Partners.

"The need is there and it's not going away," Seigle Avenue Executive Director Mary Nell McPherson says. "If we don't educate children well, we'll never get out of the quandary we're in. And this is very hopeful work."

september is recovery month!

Tomorrow is the first day of Recovery Month to honor and celebrate the lives of everyone both in recovery and those whose lives have been touched by the disease of addiction. We invite you to join us.  Recovery NC will be highlighting your stories and events all month long.  Want to be a part of the biggest month long celebration in North Carolina?  Here are some things you can do to make this the best recovery month celebration ever:

So, we encourage anyone who desires to tell a story from their perspective (a loved one - spouse, child, mother, father, sister, brother, cousin, etc. - best friend, advocate, provider of any services that assist persons on their roads to recovery as well as those who are in recovery from addiction) to select the template that you feel most comfortable using, or create your own unique story. Not all stories have a happy ending, but more do end happily than the American public realizes.  You can download the story templates from <http://www.recoverync.org/>http://www.recoverync.org/ - we will post them anonymously per your request but want to remember and celebrate the lives of everyone that has experienc! ed addiction.

3. Share your event.  Every page of <http://www.recoverync.org>www.recoverync.org has a banner where you can find the event in North Carolina closest to you.  We encourage you to find an event near you or if you are hosting an event  please post it on <http://www.recoverymonth.gov>www.recoverymonth.gov or email <mailto:donna.cotter@recoverync.org>donna.cotter@recoverync.org - we'd like to let everyone know about the diversity of the celebrations in North Carolina by posting as many as we can.  Do you have a unique event in the state?  Let us know about it.  We're excited to learn about your celebrations!

Subject: Protecting the classrooms

Comment: I find it very ironic that the opening screen for your site shows how you vow to protect the classrooms. Why then aren't you keeping your word. Allowing the speach to take place having our children a captive audience is not protection. To allow this to move forward is a disgrace and is not needed according to our state constitution. This is what Hitler did with the youth. The GIVE ACT is a prelude to the enslavement of our children. To allow one speach will set a precedent for more to follow.

The Morality of Healthcare Reform

<http://www.city-journal.org/2009/eon0903ph.html> It's the System
Paul Howard, City Journal Online, September 3, 2009
Changing its tactics in the health-care debate, the White House has begun stressing the moral imperative to provide health insurance to all Americans. "I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper," President Obama now argues. "And in the wealthiest nation on earth right now, we are neglecting to live up to that call." But Obama is just plain wrong that America is neglecting its obligations to the most vulnerable. The real health-care problem is not moral but structural and systemic . . .

Health Insurance Tax Will Hurt Employers

RADIO
On Monday, August 31, 2009, Diana Furchtgott-Roth, adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, appeared on the following shows to discuss the the impact of the federal tax on business that do not provide health insurance to their employees.

Will Ted Kennedy's Legacy Affect Healthcare Reform?

<http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columns/Manhattan-Moment/How-to-save-Obamacare-and-Kennedy_s-legacy-8182811-56658527.html> Obamacare and Kennedy's legacy
Paul Howard, Washington Examiner, September 2, 2009
Ted Kennedy, the Lion of the Senate, has been laid to rest.But his legacy on health care reform, the issue he called "the cause of my life," is in peril. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seems determined to pass a health care bill that will drive the nation deeper into debt, lead to sweeping government intervention in private health care markets, and still leave millions uninsured. Liberal Democrats - perhaps using Kennedy's death as a rallying cry - may try a "go it alone" strategy that relies on a parliamentary procedure known as "reconciliation" to pass central planks of their health-reform legislation in the Senate with just 51 votes.

Japan and Entrepreneurs

<http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2009/09/02/japan_is_losing_its_ultimate_resource_97387.html> Japan Is Losing Its Ultimate Resource
Steven Malanga, RealClearMarkets.com, September 2, 2009
The historic vote in Japan's recent national election, in which the Liberal Democratic Party which ruled nearly continuously for more than six decades has lost control of the government, is testament to deep undercurrents of discontent in a country whose economy is no bigger today than it was in 1996. . .But change will come slowly for Japan because the roots of its economic problems are deep and not always well understood. Yes, the country is struggling under a mountain of debt accumulated during a decade of public works spending that didn't do much to boost the economy. And government policies and regulations still protect large segments of the economy. . .

Why Health Care Costs So Much

<http://www.manhattan-institute.org/assets/images/cr_58.gif>The Manhattan Institute's Center for Civic Innovation released a report by Marcus Winters and Jay Greene about how vouchers in special education may help to limit public schools' misdiagnoses of children that are not actually learning disabled...

Jay P. Greene and Marcus A. Winters, The Tampa Tribune, September 3, 2009
Over the last 30 years, special education has grown dramatically in Florida and across the nation. But in the last decade, Florida has managed to constrain growth in special education in a way that other states have not: since 1999, special education rates have actually declined in Florida while national disability rates have increased by about 5 percent. What's Florida's secret? According to our new study for the Manhattan Institute, the state's McKay Scholarship Program, a novel voucher program for disabled students, is an important piece of the puzzle. . .

Affordable Housing

<http://www.lohud.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009908300309> The Affordable-Housing Pact: A Flawed Remedy For Suburbs
Howard Husock, The Journal News, August 30, 2009
(This article is adapted from the forthcoming fall issue of City Journal)
Is Westchester County racially segregated? That's the premise of the landmark legal settlement that, if approved by the Board of Legislators, will have the county build some 750 units of affordable housing in high-income areas. In endorsing the deal, federal Housing and Urban Development deputy secretary, Ronald Sims, called it "consistent with the president's desire to see a fully integrated society." But an analysis of census data shows that it's wrong to call Westchester segregated. And research commissioned by HUD itself suggests that relocating low-income households to high-income areas - to receive what Sims calls "the fruits and benefits of an established neighborhood" - isn't likely to lead to social or economic improvement. . .

Unions Twist and Omit Facts

<http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2009/09/03/dont_buy_unions_labor_day_bluster_97389.html> Don't Buy Unions' Labor Day Bluster
Diana Furchtgott-Roth, RealClearMarkets.com, September 3, 2009
Next Monday, Labor Day, is the occasion for labor unions to celebrate the contributions their members have made to American prosperity. With union membership down to 8% of private-sector employees, unions are eager to sign up new members in order to swell their ranks, replenish their treasuries and infuse new contributions into union-sponsored pension plans, many of which are underfunded. In the process of recruiting new members, some labor organizations, such as the AFL-CIO, don't mind twisting and omitting facts. . .

America's Discount Culture

Charlotte Allen, Los Angeles Times, August 30, 2009
Just in time for the worst economic downturn since the Depression, here comes a new crop of social critics to inform us that we're actually spending too little for the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the furniture we sit on and the gasoline that runs our automobiles. Never mind that U.S. job losses these days range from 200,000 to 500,000 a month, that foreclosures are up 32% over this time last year and that people are re-learning how to clip newspaper coupons so as to save at the supermarket. Dire economic circumstances don't seem to faze these spending enthusiasts. . .

Gov't Endangering FDIC's Role in Market Discipline

ARTICLE
<http://city-journal.org/2009/eon0901ng.html> Failing Up
Nicole Gelinas, City Journal Online, September 1, 2009
(This is also linked on <http://www.RealClearMarkets.com>RealClearMarkets.com, 9-02-09)
. . .Too-big-to-fail is more alive than ever. In fact, the financial crisis has shown just how valuable the government's implicit guarantee of big banks is: according to FDIC data, banks with $100 billion-plus in assets can borrow at rates one-third of a percentage point lower than the rate available to smaller banks. That's more than quadruple the advantage they enjoyed pre-crisis, and a mark of lenders' confidence that the government will protect them. As FDIC chairman Sheila Bair wrote in Tuesday's New York Times, the government lacks "a credible method for closing large financial institutions without inflicting severe collateral damage on the economy." By contrast, Bair wrote, "Main Street banks"--smaller banks, that is--"are sensitive to market discipline because they know that they're not too big to fail and that they'll be closed if they become insolvent". . .

Dem Party Followed Ted Kennedy Leftward

<http://city-journal.org/2009/eon0904df.html> In Step with Ted
Daniel J. Flynn, City Journal Online, September 4, 2009
When Ted Kennedy won his first election in 1962, he joined a Massachusetts congressional delegation composed of Republican Leverett Saltonstall in the Senate and eight Democrats and six Republicans in the House. Though Democrats controlled both houses of the state legislature, Republican John Volpe served as governor. Massachusetts, then, was the picture of divided government. But today, a week after Kennedy's death, Democrats hold every statewide constitutional office, both houses of the legislature have been in Democratic hands for half a century, and Democrats constitute the Bay State's entire congressional delegation. . .

Criminalizing Corporate Conduct

J.P. Donlon, Chief Executive, August 2009
There is no question that the general trend of criminalizing corporate conduct, often thought to be confined to headline-grabbing cases, will ultimately reach down to medium-size and smaller businesses. The question is, will this drift affect executive decision-making and have larger economic consequences for expansion, investment and employment? To address this, the Manhattan Institute's Center for Legal Policy together with Chief Executive held a forum in New York with two experts with deep experience with this: Richard Thornburgh and Ken Langone.

<http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_3_al-kassar.html>Inside a Terror Trial
Steve Cohen, City Journal, Summer 2009
. . .The case was one of the most significant in the U.S. government's battle against terrorism. It pitted the United States against Monzer al-Kassar, one of the world's most successful--the prosecutors would say notorious--arms dealers. Whether it established any significant legal precedents would be left for the appellate lawyers to debate. But its outcome would certainly set the tone for the new Obama administration's undercover strategies. . .

<http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_3_jewish-capitalism.html>Silicon Israel
George Gilder, City Journal, Summer 2009
The most precious resource in the world economy is human genius, which we may define as the ability to devise significant inventions that enhance survival and prosperity. At any one time, genius is embodied in just a few score thousand people, a creative minority that accounts for most human accomplishment and wealth. Cities and nations rise and thrive when they welcome entrepreneurial and technical genius; when they overtax, criminalize, or ostracize it, they wither. . .

<http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_3_otbie-inflation.html>Inflation's Moral Hazard
Theodore Dalrymple, City Journal, Summer 2009
Information from the most diverse sources sometimes coalesces and provokes reflection on a subject to which one has not previously given sufficient thought. This happened to me recently with regard to the effect of monetary inflation on human character. With many observers predicting a substantial rise in inflation as a result of various government spending programs undertaken to reverse the current global downturn, the topic is anything but academic. . .

City Journal Special Issue: 'New York's Tomorrow'

<http://www.manhattan-institute.org/assets/images/CJ_nytom.gif>

<http://city-journal.org/2009/nytom_migration.html>Escape from New York
Wendell Cox, City Journal, Special Issue
New York State faces a host of economic and budgetary problems, as many of the stories in this issue make clear. One way of expressing the depth of these problems is through the state's startling domestic-migration numbers. "Domestic migration" refers to people who move from one location to another within the United States. It takes into account migrants both into a state and out of it, subtracting immigrants from emigrants to yield the net number of people leaving a state. When that number is high, we can deduce that a state's problems are prompting its residents to flee for friendlier locales. . .

New York's Fiscal Health

BLOG ENTRY
<http://www.nyfiscalwatch.com/?p=1859>Pension Bomb Boomlet
E.J. McMahon, NYFiscalWatch.com, September 3, 2009
Tax-funded contributions to the New York State Employee Retirement System (ERS) will have to jump by 61 percent between 2010 and 2011, state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli announced today. Contributions for members of the Police and Fire Retirement System (PFRS)- already higher to begin with - will rise by 21 percent during the same period. Extrapolating from currently available payroll information, these increases will translate into added costs of at least $400 million for the state and roughly $750 million for local governments and public authorities...

America's Universities

<http://www.mindingthecampus.com/originals/2009/09/the_aaup_dismisses_academic_fr.html> Not Your Grandparents' AAUP
KC Johnson, MindingTheCampus.com, September 2, 2009
AAUP president Cary Nelson recently e-mailed his membership about an important new venture for the academic union. Proclaiming "this is not your grandparents' AAUP," Nelson celebrated the work of the "Department of Organizing and Services," which had discovered "a faculty band from Ohio performing original songs about the ironies of current academic life." Perhaps Nelson should spend less time thinking about new songs and focus more on the central task of "your grandparents' AAUP"---upholding the principle of academic freedom. In two recent, high-profile controversies, the self-described "tenured radical" has seemed intent on transforming the AAUP from an organization devoted to promoting academic freedom into a battering ram to perpetuate the groupthink that dominates so many quarters of the contemporary academy. . .

Book Review: The Promise Land

<http://www.city-journal.org/2009/bc0828ss.html> The Promise Land
Sol Stern, City Journal Online, August 28, 2009
(Review of <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0980076358/manhattaninstitu/>The Israel Test, by George Gilder)
It was serendipitous that I was in Israel when I read The Israel Test, the latest book from George Gilder, the high-tech guru and author of the classic Wealth and Poverty. Almost every day during the six weeks that I spent in the country this summer, I experienced the vibrancy of an amazingly successful society that, in Gilder's estimation, not only towers over all of its neighbors but invites a more ambitious comparison: "Dwarfing Israel's own wealth is Israel's contribution to the world economy, stemming from Israeli creativity and entrepreneurial innovation. Israelâ€™s technical and scientific gifts to global progress loom with similar majesty over all contributions outside the United States". . .

Book Reviews: William F. Buckley

<http://city-journal.org/2009/bc0904jp.html> All My Sons
James Panero, City Journal Online, September 4, 2009
(Review of <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446540943/manhattaninstitu/>Losing Mum and Pup: A Memoir, by Christopher Buckley and <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465013554/manhattaninstitu/>Right Time, Right Place: Coming of Age with William F. Buckley Jr. and the Conservative Movement, by Richard Brookhiser)
. . .Neither Losing Mum and Pup nor Right Time, Right Place departs from Buckley's politics in a marked way, but both books provide what we might call "unauthorized" accounts of the Buckley story. They are products of, at times, seething exasperation with their subject, yet each pays tribute to him in its own manner. William F. Buckley cast a long shadow. In their inability to get out from under it, Christopher Buckley and Richard Brookhiser reveal the height of the figure towering above them.

[NCDP-on-Trial] 135:  Case #001
Overview:  For more than 2 years, Buncombe County Commissioner David Young was made constantly and specifically aware of serious problems within the NC Democratic Party unleashed by former NCDP Chair Jerry Meek, as have thousands of other Dems across NC.  
.
Today, if you email current State Democratic Party Chair David Young and ask him what he is doing to correct these, he responds by refusing to admit there are any problems, even if laid out in detail before him.  David Young is following the instructions left by Jerry Meek: If you ignore problems long enough, they will go away. They did not for Jerry. They shall not for David.
.
At his first State Executive Committee Meeting on Aug 29th, David had 2 choices: Remove every Party Officer who was also a member of an illicit Progressive Group, or put these Party Officers on public trial so that all Democrats across NC can know the damage Progressives are intentionally doing to the Party. Lacking the courage to do his duty, David chose to put them on Trial.  Questions about David's choice of procedure may be Emailed to <mailto:DYoung@ncdp.org>DYoung@ncdp.org

Vice Chair position currently occupied by Merkle was previously held by Catherine Evangelista.  Both are residents of Cary NC in Wake County.  In April 2008, Progressive and former Wake County Chair Doris Weaver filed charges with the State Party Council of Review against Evangelista, who was then Cary Vice Chair.  The Council met, reviewed, deliberated, and acquitted Evangelista of Weaver's charges.
.
In August 2008, Weaver filed a malformed Appeal.  Improper intervention by State Chair & Lawyer Jerry Meek caused a reversal of a Council of Review acquittal, which has not happened in decades.  Evangelista was removed ONLY as Cary Vice Chair.  Evangelista was NOT removed from the higher elective Office of Wake County SEC Member, nor as Chair of her Precinct.
.
When no one would stand for election to the Cary Vice Chair Position which Evangelista was forced to vacate by the Wake Co Chair and State Party Chair, Merkle took it over.
.
.
------------------------- SITUATION ---------------------------
.
Evangelista was asked if she would run for Cary Town Council in her District C, by the Mayor of Cary (a Democrat), to unseat a Republican Incumbent.  Merkle had written in online Blogs that she could not recruit any Cary Democrat to run for that Office. When no other Democratic Candidate came forth, Evangelista filed on the final morning of registration.
.
Subsequently, Merkle has been actively working to defeat Evangelista, which would thereby cause election of the Republican Candidate. For an Officer of the Democratic Party to help defeat a Democrat is a serious violation of Party Rules.
.
.
------------------------- INCIDENTS ---------------------------
.
1) The current round of inappropriate behavior of Merkle began soon after Evangelista was re-elected as a SEC Member at the Wake County Convention on 18 April 2009.  On 24 April Merkle posted this on a public access Blogsite, commenting to other SEC Democrats:  "I wonder if she got a hold of some ballots and checked off her name?"
.
2) In June, as a Precinct Chair, Evangelista tried several times to meet with Merkle to discuss Candidate recruitment for Cary District C.  Merkle avoided all attempts.
.
3)  On 17 July Evangelista registered as the only Democrat running for Cary Town Council, District C.  Fifteen minutes before the noon deadline, Merkle also arrived at the Wake County Board of Elections, and before witnesses told Evangelista that the race was going to get ugly, inferring that she was intending to make it so.
.
4)  Later in July, Evangelista sought to meet with Merkle to resolve threats to her campaign.  Merkle refused to meet.
.
5)  On 27 July at a Wake Co Party Board meeting, Merkle spoke in favor of a Motion to keep Evangelista's name OFF of published lists of the Party's endorsed Municipal Candidates.  The Motion failed.
.
6)  In August, Merkle has, upon multiple occasions, posted political criticism of Candidate Evangelista on the public access Blogsite carypolitics.org, berating Evangelista falsely and unfairly, attacking Evangelista as if Merkle were her Republican opponent.
.
7)  On 27 August, Evangelista was told in front of witnesses that Merkle was approaching other Democratic Candidates in separate Cary Elections, telling them that if they support Evangelista they should not expect support from the Party.
.
8)  Merkle's efforts to defeat Democratic Candidate Evangelista are interfering with her ability to raise Campaign funds and to secure votes for Office, willfully damaging the reputation of a fellow Democrat.
. 
9)  Mutual friends have attempted intervention with Merkle, but nothing seems to dissuade Merkle from her continuing public and private attacks.
.
10)  Evangelista has notified Wake Co Party Chair Jack Nichols of this situation.  Despite the Chair's discussions with Merkle, attacks continue.
.
.
------------------------ INFRACTIONS ------------------------
.
A)  Democratic Party Officer Merkle has chosen to play the political role of saboteur instead of honoring her responsibility as an Officer of the Democratic Party to support all Democratic Candidates.
.
B)  Democratic Party Officer Merkle is making concerted, repeated public attacks upon a Democrat who is the only opponent of a Republican Candidate.
.
C)  Democratic Party Officer Merkle is willfully and intentionally aiding and abetting the election of a Republican over a Democrat, failing in her duties as a Party Officer to assist electing Democrats.
.
D)  The NCDP Plan of Organization requires that any Officer of the Party -- choosing to misbehave as Merkle does -- must be immediately suspended.  Any registered Democrat may file a formal Petition with the State Party Council of Review, seeking permanent removal from all Party Offices.  Valid Petitions require signatures of 3 Democrats.
.
E)  If the County Chair refuses to suspend Merkle -- thereby himself supporting sabotage of a Democrat by a Party Officer -- then the County Chair could face a Petition for his own removal.

This is from an article in the St. Petersburg Times Newspaper on
Sunday.  The Business Section asked readers for ideas on "How Would
You Fix the Economy?"  I think this guy nailed it!


Dear Mr. President:

Please find below my suggestion for fixing Americas economy.
Instead of giving billions of dollars to companies that will squander

the money on lavish parties and unearned bonuses, use the following plan.

You can call it the Patriotic Retirement Plan:

There are about 40 million people over 50 in the work force.
Pay them $1 million apiece severance for early retirement with the following
stipulations:

1) They MUST retire. Forty million job openings - Unemployment fixed.

2) They MUST buy a new American CAR. Forty million cars ordered - Auto Industry
fixed.



3 They MUST either buy a house or pay off their mortgage - Housing Crisis fixed.

It can't get any easier than that!



If more money is needed, have all members of Congress and their
constituents pay their taxes...  


If you think this would work, please forward to everyone you know.

Dix will stay open; city park plan in limbo

RALEIGH -- After working for nearly a decade to close Dorothea Dix Hospital, state mental health administrators now intend to keep a sizable number of staff and patients at the aging Raleigh facility for years.

Lanier Cansler, secretary for the state Department of Health and Human Services, said this week that he plans to move about half of Dix's more than 200 patients to Central Regional Hospital in Butner when it opens fully in October.

But he said Dix will remain open as a stand-alone psychiatric hospital, with its own director and administrative staff. It will no longer serve as a satellite campus for the new Butner facility.

<http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/dix/story/1665317.html##><http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/dix/story/1665317.html##><http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/dix/story/1665317.html##><http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/dix/story/1665317.html##>

State legislators affirmed that decision earlier this month when they approved a state budget that restored $6 million in funding for operations at Dix for the next year. That move came as legislators made $155 million in spending cuts for other mental health programs in the 2010 budget.

"My expectation is, absent inability to get funding, we would continue at Dix for several years," said Cansler, who was appointed by Gov. Beverly Perdue.

The move to continue operating Dix as a state mental hospital will hamper efforts to turn the more than 300 acres between downtown Raleigh and N.C. State University into a major park operated by the City of Raleigh or a nonprofit foundation.

It also offers evidence that the sweeping 2001 mental health reform plan has failed. A centerpiece of that effort, which was passed by the legislature and carried out by the administration of former Gov. Mike Easley, was a plan to reduce the need for beds at mental hospitals. Instead, there would be more private, community-based treatment.

The state halved the number of state hospital beds but then diverted much of the money intended to increase outpatient care.

As a result, demand for the remaining beds at state facilities has grown so high that those in need of help are routinely turned away while the expected cost savings from reform never materialized. Closing Dix now would exacerbate the crisis.

"The implementation of reform was not successful," said Rep. Verla Insko, a Chapel Hill Democrat who co-chairs the legislative oversight committee for mental health. "I don't think you can call it a complete failure, but certainly it has not measured up to our expectations. Now is not the time to downsize, given the budget cuts to community services."

The $6 million budgeted for Dix operations is not a recurring appropriation, meaning that legislators will have to approve additional money to keep Dix open past 2010. But state officials say they no longer plan to close Dix, and key legislators say the facility is likely to be needed for the foreseeable future.

Courts involved

State officials will need judicial approval to move beds from Dix to Central Regional Hospital.

Wake County Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour issued a temporary restraining order last year that bars the state from closing Dix, which opened in 1856. The judge acted in response to a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Dix patients by the advocacy group Disability Rights North Carolina, which raised concerns about numerous problems that endangered patients at the new $138 million hospital in Butner.

from the day it opened in July 2008, operations at Central Regional were plagued by poor planning, design flaws, a faulty security system and insufficient staffing. For the last year, large sections of the massive new building have remained vacant.

Cansler said the department intends to return to court in September to ask that the restraining order be lifted.

from the Assoc. Press report on Yahoo.com (case involves Geodon and Zoloft, too:

"...A Pfizer subsidiary, Pharmacia and Upjohn Inc., which was acquired in 2003, has entered an agreement to plead guilty to one count of felony misbranding. The criminal case applied only to Bextra.

The $1 billion in civil penalties was related to Bextra and a number of other medicines.

A portion of the civil penalty will be distributed to 49 states and the District of Columbia, according to agreements with each state's Medicaid program.

Pfizer's top lawyer, Amy Schulman, said the settlements "bring final closure to significant legal matters and help to enhance our focus on what we do best -- discovering, developing and delivering innovative medicines."

In her statement, Schulman said: "We regret certain actions taken in the past, but are proud of the action we've taken to strengthen our internal controls and pioneer new procedures."

In financial filings in January, the company had indicated that it would pay $2.3 billion over the allegations.

The civil settlement announced Wednesday covered Pfizer's promotions of Bextra, blockbuster nerve pain and epilepsy treatment Lyrica, schizophrenia medicine Geodon, antibiotic Zyvox and nine other medicines. The agreement with the Justice Department resolves the investigation into promotion of all those drugs, Pfizer said.

The government said Pfizer also paid kickbacks to market a host of big-name drugs: Aricept, Celebrex, Lipitor, Norvasc, Relpax, Viagra, Zithromax, Zoloft, and Zyrtec.

The allegations came to light thanks largely to five Pfizer employees and one Pennsylvania doctor, who will now share $102 million of the settlement money.

FBI Assistant Director Kevin Perkins praised the whistleblowers who decided to "speak out against a corporate giant that was blatantly violating the law and misleading the public through false marketing claims."

To rein in the abuses, the government's five-year monitoring will force Pfizer to notify doctors about Wednesday's agreement, encourage them to report any similar behavior, and publicly post any payments or perks it gives to doctors.

Under terms of the settlement, Pfizer must pay $1 billion to compensate Medicaid, Medicare, and other federal health care programs. Some of that money will be shared among the states: New York, for example, will receive $66 million, according to the state's attorney general, Andrew Cuomo.

When Pfizer originally disclosed the settlement figure, it also announced plans to acquire rival Wyeth for $68 billion. That deal, which would bolster Pfizer's position as the world's top drugmaker by revenue, is expected to close before year's end.

Shares of Pfizer dropped 14 cents to $16.24 in midday trading."

Study: Doctors Don't Always Spot Depression

By John Cloud Time Magazine July 30th 2009

NYAPRS Note: The following article highlights a new study by Alex Mitchell, Amol Vaze and Sanjay Rao of Leicester General Hospital in the U.K.

Their research found that among a general population of 100, about 20 people will develop depression, but the typical doctor will recognize depression in only 10 people-and among the 80 people without depression, the doctor will incorrectly identify depression in 15.

This is important research that calls on our mental health system to recognize that in our efforts to integrate mental and physical health care, we need to ensure that we do not overly rely on medical doctors to recognize and help address various psychiatric disabilities like depression because in the end this may result in under/over diagnosis and wrong or inadequate treatments.

Although the stigma once associated with mental illness has receded in recent years, most of the 12 million Americans who have clinical depression <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9002497>still don't get treated for it, partly because many are too embarrassed to go to a psychologist. In fact, according to mental-health professionals, the majority of depressed people who seek professional help turn first not to a psychologist but to their primary-care physician.

But do regular doctors really know how to identify depression? A large new scientific review published July 30 by the journal <http://www.thelancet.com>Lancet suggests they don't. In a review of 41 previous studies involving more than 50,000 patients in developed nations around the world, the authors found that general practitioners make frequent mistakes, missing true cases of depression about half the time and incorrectly diagnosing it in 19% of healthy people. <http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1903873_1903802,00.html>(See how to prevent illness at any age.)

Alex Mitchell, Amol Vaze and Sanjay Rao of Leicester General Hospital in the U.K. estimate that about 1 in 5 people in developed nations will experience depression in their lifetime. That means that among a general patient population of 100, about 20 will develop the condition, but the typical doctor will find it in only 10 of those who have it. And among the 80 healthy people, the doctor will incorrectly identify depression in 15.

This is significant because depression â€” especially if it goes untreated â€” can be debilitating for the patient and his or her family. Depression also carries an enormous societal burden, leading to missed work days, loss of productivity and increases in health-care spending for co-occurring conditions like sleep problems or anxiety. Further, those misdiagnosed with depression may end up being prescribed antidepressant medications that not only cost a lot but can have serious side effects, including lethargy and sexual dysfunction.

The various studies that Mitchell, Vaze and Rao reviewed used different methods to verify whether doctors had missed depression in their patients. In some of the studies, researchers went back over case records and picked out patients who appeared to have the illness. In other studies, researchers interviewed patients and made diagnoses in person. But virtually all the studies pointed to the same conclusion: general physicians aren't very good at recognizing the most common mental illness in the world.

Why? One reason is that the typical doctor visit â€” even in wealthy nations â€” is quite short, usually no longer than 15 minutes. It's hard for patients, who may already be reluctant to discuss depression, to open up about their symptoms during that brief period. The authors of the paper suggest that doctors should spend more time or schedule follow-up appointments with patients they suspect have depression; research has shown that such follow-ups can dramatically increase the rate of accurate diagnoses.

That's surely a worthy goal, although, at least in the U.S., it offers a classic example of the incentive problems in the current health-care system: if general practitioners spend extra time with each patient trying to diagnose psychiatric problems, they will see fewer patients in a day, which means fewer reimbursements overall from the insurance companies. So is there another way?

Maybe. One method might be to write diagnostic criteria for depression that are sharper than the <http://www.mental-health-today.com/dep/dsm.htm>loose catalog of symptoms used today. The current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), lists such vague symptoms as "fatigue" and "indecisiveness" as possible markers of depression. And while the definition must be broad enough to encompass a disease that manifests in many different ways in many different patients, even mental-health specialists <http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1653643,00.html>hotly debate what constitutes true depression. A commentary in the Lancet accompanying the new paper asks, "If the diagnosis of depression cannot be agreed satisfactorily by the best minds in psychiatry, why should we expect the general practitioner to be a reliable assessor of the condition?"

A large contingent of APA specialists is currently rewriting the diagnostic manual, but the revision won't be out until <http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1884092,00.html>at least 2012. In the meantime, most people will probably continue to use their general physician for front-line psychiatric care. That may be preferable to not seeking care at all, but for high-risk patients â€” such as those who have a family history of depression, recent stressful life events, chronic illness or substance abuse â€” it would be wiser to seek specialized attention.

Back to Campus
Mental health is a serious issue on college campuses. The stigma surrounding mental health issues sometimes intimidates students, parents, school officials and the public from addressing them.  Mental health conditions are most common during the college years and early adulthood, and many college students face a barrage of daily challenges that can affect their mental health and wellness. Yet it is possible to improve understanding of mental health and mental illness among students, school officials and the public â€“ and to improve prevention and treatment interventions for college students.
For questions or more information on college-related stress, depression, anxiety, or any other mental health concern, contact MHA/NC Information & Referral Line at 800-897-7494.

Back Off Bully!
<http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1102680241939&s=983&e=001qzTkbgpH2GtONU6s-zmN2Ov1Hh8B_C8H920Kn248Tiwz9foqfVN2N7HlxJ8bapJ64FvClpKfYz-FxfESg-m_E135ZfiaWky_mvurJt5QPadtl3tNqRFWhmZU9TBNWXfSIm8p6mZJRXUItDW-k14wTQ==>Bullying is more than physical intimidation by isolated individuals. Instead, it can be understood as a power dynamic that results in fear, shame, and embarrassment. Bullying is pervasive--it not only emerges on the playground, but in families, the workplace, the classroom, church, or any setting in which people interact. This program explains the roots of bullying behavior in its many manifestations--verbal, emotional and physical harassment, teasing, nit-picking, exclusion, humiliation, intimidation, and invalid criticism--and how to transform the bully-victim relationship through measures to develop awareness of ourselves and the impact of our actions on others.

The North Carolina Psychoanalytic Society and The North Carolina Psychoanalytic Foundation are presenting, Back Off Bully: Why We Are All Bullies and Why We Don't Have To Be on  Saturday, October 24, 2009, 9am-5pm, with distinguished speakers Peter Fonagy, PhD, FBA and Stuart Twemlow, MD, at the UNC Friday Center for Continuing Education in Chapel Hill.  For more information, visit <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1102680241939&s=983&e=001qzTkbgpH2Gv7JwLXiNroqLpwFDi98MskPX0BWb9rX-OIk2fROsEyY2dmgWnvUCyaWG0sVA6sW3AcqXVHbHYwMIrvXT8X2MGzxczzjQzBrln5-1f-aYNlNDX0R1FWnqCuRiocwrc9pdFNq6I5sxIk9A==>http://ncpsychoanalysis.org/ps-ncconference.htm

About The Soloist:  Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx raise the bar with two of the year's best performances" (Peter Travers, Rolling Stone) in this moving and emotional story, based on the best-selling book by Los Angeles Times journalist Steve Lopez.

When Lopez (OscarÂ® nominee Robert Downey Jr.) discovers former classical music prodigy Nathaniel Anthony Ayers (Oscar winner Jamie Foxx) playing his violin on the streets of L.A. , he endeavors to help the troubled genius find his way back. The unique bond that forms between them makes for a poignant and soaring tale that is "powerful and inspiring" (Shawn Edwards, Fox Television).


<http://www.sprc.org/news/index.asp#national>Mental stress training is planned for U.S. soldiers
The New York Times
For the first time, the U.S. Army plans to conduct emotional resiliency training for all active-duty soldiers, reservists, and members of the National Guard. The training is meant to help prevent mental health problems such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and to help reduce suicide risk. The training is based on techniques that help people analyze and revise faulty thinking habits and beliefs that can lead to negative mental states, such as anger and frustration. The Army will work with the University of Michigan to track and evaluate the results.  Full article:

Threshold in Durham Releases DVD Documenting Community Mural Project
Threshold, a rehabilitation clubhouse in Durham, NC continues provides education, employment, community and hope for adults with a severe mental illness.

Patience, persistence and courage are high on the list of qualities exhibited by members of Threshold.  Mental illness may mean hearing noises, struggling with simple tasks, or taking medications with horrendous side effects.  Even still, members go on.  They run the clubhouse, cook meals, answer phones, write newsletters, develop skills to help with re-entering the job market, and work in real jobs in the community through the "Transitional Employment" program.

In December 2007, Threshold launched a community mural project to celebrate the courage and tenacity of individuals who live with mental illness. Durham artist Andria Linn (<http://www.andrialinn.com/>www.andrialinn.com) brainstormed with Threshold members about what it means to live with mental illness and what role Threshold plays in their lives. 



Threshold members gave input on the design, a beautiful image that incorporates symbols of hope and support and reflects the diversity of our community. The project culminated with the installation of an 18 x 18-foot mural on the Main Street side of the Bull City Business Center in downtown Durham .

â€œCourage to Reveal, Courage to Heal: Thresholdâ€™s Wall of Hopeâ€ celebrates the positive contributions of adults with mental illness. With the project, Threshold also recognized the longtime support and collaboration of transitional employers, and gave Durham a beautiful piece of art, one that reminds us that by joining together, we can build a stronger community.

The entire inspiring process was captured on film, and the documentary is now available on DVD.  For more information, or to view a copy, visit <http://www.thresholdclubhouse.org/>www.thresholdclubhouse.org.

Ease kids' anxiety over starting at new school

By Dipali Pathak Send <mailto:?body=I%20thought%20you%20might%20be%20interested%20in%20this%20story,%20Ease%20kids'%20anxiety%20over%20starting%20at%20new%20school%20-%20August%202009%20-%20Findings%20-%20Baylor%20College%20of%20Medicine%20-%20Houston,%20Texas.%20You%20can%20see%20this%20story%20at:%20http://www.bcm.edu/findings/vol7/is7/09aug_n2.html>this page to a friend.

Starting at a new school â€“ whether it's because of a move or simply graduating to a higher grade â€“ can be difficult for children and adolescents. But parents and children can work together to ease the transition, according to a <http://www.bcm.edu/>Baylor College of Medicine expert.

Some of children's chief fears include whether they will make new friends and fit in and if they can perform at a certain level, said <http://www.bcm.edu/psychiatry/index.cfm?PMID=9398>Leng Bang, M.D., assistant professor of psychiatry and behavior sciences at BCM.

"Anxiety is a typical reaction in these types of situations,â€ said Bang, who is also a pediatric psychiatrist at <http://www.bcm.edu/findings/vol7/is7/www.texaschildrenshospital.org>Texas Children's Hospital.

Parents' role

Parents can take an active role in preparing their kids for this change and alleviating some fears.

"You can prepare them by taking them to purchase school supplies and new clothing. Get them on a regular nighttime and morning routine, and talk to them about worries they might have,â€ said Bang.

It's important for parents to maintain open communication with their kids, and it's just as important to communicate with their teachers and the school.

Get involved

"If you have a positive attitude toward your child's school and are happy to get involved in school activities, your child will reflect this behavior,â€ said Bang. "If you are involved in school activities, it's a great way for children to make new friends.â€

Although anxiety is typical initially, it should fade over time, said Bang. If parents start noticing changes in sleep and eating patterns and grades and an increase in complaints of anxiety-related ailments such as headaches and stomachaches, it may be time to intervene.

"Talk to your child's teacher to see if they have noticed any changes at school as well. You might then want to get the school counselor involved to help your child get through this difficult time,â€ said Bang.

Anxieties can develop about school that may lead to behavioral changes or even school refusal. If this occurs, it is often helpful to seek help from child mental health professionals, said Bang.

In the end, maintaining open communication and staying involved will make the adjustment period easier for kids.

<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/24/86-percent-rise-in-adhd-m_n_266818.html>Study Shows Massive Rise In ADHD Drug Abuse Among Teens

<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/24/86-percent-rise-in-adhd-m_n_266818.html?view=print>Lindsey Tanner Huffington Post August 24, 2009

CHICAGO â€” Calls to poison control centers about teens abusing attention-deficit drugs soared 76 percent over eight years, sobering evidence about the dangerous consequences of prescription misuse, a study shows.

The calls were from worried parents, emergency room doctors and others seeking advice on how to deal with the problem, which can be deadly. Four deaths were among cases evaluated in the study.

Kids taking ADHD drugs to get high or increase alertness may not realize that misuse of the drugs can cause serious, sometimes life-threatening symptoms, including agitation, rapid heartbeat, extremely high blood pressure.

"They say, 'It's FDA approved, how dangerous could it be?'" said Steve Pasierb, head of The Partnership for a Drug-Free America, based in New York.

In the study, researchers from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center evaluated 1998-2005 data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers. During that time, nationwide calls related to teen abuse of ADHD drugs, specifically stimulants, increased from 330 to 581 yearly, and there were four deaths. Overall, 42 percent of teens involved had moderate to severe side-effects and most ended up getting emergency-room treatment.

The true number of teen abusers who have bad side effects is likely much higher, because many cases don't result in calls to poison control centers, said study author Dr. Randall Bond, medical director of the hospital's Drug and Poison Information Center.

The surge, from 1998 to 2005, outpaced calls for teen substance abuse generally. It also paralleled an 86 percent rise in ADHD medicine prescriptions for kids aged 10 to 19, from about 4 million to nearly 8 million during that time.

"It's more bad news on an entrenched problem," Pasierb said. His nonprofit group was not involved in the study. Its own research suggests that about 19 percent of teens have abused prescription drugs including medicine for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Government-sponsored surveys suggest that teen abuse of stimulants including ADHD drugs has declined in recent years.

The new study was for release Monday in the August edition of Pediatrics.

Mark Stein, a psychiatry professor and ADHD expert at University of Illinois at Chicago, said abuse typically involves crushing and snorting the pills, which speeds up the effects and can produce a buzz or sense of euphoria â€“ along with dangerous side effects.

Kids who develop serious side effects should be taken to the emergency room, where sedatives can be used to treat the problem, Stein said.

The study lacks information on whether abusers were teens with ADHD, but anecdotal evidence suggests many are not.

Stein said the study should not deter use of ADHD drugs in teens who really need them, particularly since there's evidence that kids with ADHD who don't get medication are at risk for abusing illicit drugs.

New Report Finds Bush-era Medicaid Policies on Childrenâ€™s Mental Health Continue Despite Obamaâ€™s Rollback; Children Lose Access to Vital Mental Health Care as Restrictions on Therapeutic Programs Continue

Alliance for Children and Families September 2, 2009

WASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ States have continued to implement Bush-era Medicaid policies on childrenâ€™s mental health despite a decision by the Obama administration to reverse those policies, according to a new report released today by the Alliance for Children and Families, a coalition of nonprofit health care providers for children in the child welfare system.  The Alliance estimates that left unaddressed, the ongoing implementation of the Bush policies could reduce needed mental health care for tens of thousands of children across the nation.



The report found that states are continuing to implement Bush administration policies that limited funding for mental health services for foster children with serious emotional disturbances.  These services, including therapeutic foster care (TFC), are covered by Medicaid in most states. 



The Bush administration began restricting these services in some states in 2003 and continued the restrictions throughout the 2000s, even after Congress blocked their implementation.  When President Obama entered office, he rolled back regulations limiting these Medicaid services.  However, due to a combination of state momentum and incomplete reversals of the Bush policies by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), their implementation has continued. 



Nonprofit child welfare providers report that the continuation of the Bush-era restrictions has resulted in serious harm to foster children and to state child welfare systems.  Normer Adams, Executive Director of the Georgia Association of Homes and Services for Children, described the implementation of the policies in Georgia as â€œlike a bomb was set off in our child welfare system.â€œ 



In Colorado, â€œour state system is crippled right now.  It is in fiscal crisis,â€ stated Dr. Skip Barber, Executive Director of the Colorado Association of Family and Childrenâ€™s Agencies.



Ongoing implementation of the Bush policies has also resulted in poorer health outcomes for children and increases in community violence.  â€œThe continuation of these Bush Medicaid policies is harming vulnerable childrenâ€™s health,â€œ said Patrick Lester, Senior Vice President of Public Policy for the Alliance.  â€œWe understand that policy changes take time for any new administration to implement, but it is far past time for CMS to act.â€



The report compiled information on nineteen states from 2003 to the present.  During this period, twelve of the states had implemented the Bush policies or had begun doing so, even after Congress passed a law in 2007 blocking the restrictions from taking effect.  States report that without a clear reversal of policy from CMS, they feel compelled to continue with the changes or risk being found to be out of compliance with federal Medicaid law.  The result has been widespread funding cuts to therapeutic services.



The report describes several policy options for CMS and Congress to halt the ongoing implementation of the Bush policies.  These include written guidance from CMS approving therapeutic foster care as a Medicaid-reimbursable service, which would give states immediate relief from the Bush policies.  To permanently ensure statesâ€™ ability to cover such services, Congress could consider including them in health reform as Medicaid-reimbursable services.  Congress may also opt to enact the Medicaid Services Restoration Act (S. 1217), which creates a new category of Medicaid funding for therapeutic foster care and expressly permits states to use â€œreasonableâ€ payment methodologies (including daily bundled payments) for rehabilitative services.

The Alliance for Children and Families, a nonprofit association, was formed by the 1998 merger of Family Service America and the National Association of Homes and Services for Children. The Alliance represents over 370 nonprofit organizations across the nation that provide services and economic empowerment to children and families. Alliance agencies cover a wide spectrum of providers, including a diversity of faith-based organizations and nonsectarian agencies. Together, these organizations deliver more than $2 billion annually in services to more than 8 million people in nearly 6,700 communities across the United States.

Groups issue guidelines for antidepressant use during pregnancy.

Following a <http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009082401apa&r=1662107-1385&l=002-ef6&t=c>Wall Street Journal story, ABC World News (8/23, story 5, 2:00, Harris) reported, "As many as 23 percent of expectant mothers suffer from depression. Now, a new report offers concrete guidelines in deciding whether or not to take an antidepressant." Correspondent Andrea Canning explained, "The report recommends women with mild depression rely on talk therapy, but those with suicidal feelings or feelings of hopelessness need more aggressive treatment." ABC News showed Dr. Marie Savard, ABC News medical contributor, saying, "They are the women that need to stay on medication through pregnancy and beyond." According to Canning, "doctors say there is no separating the health of the mother from the health of her baby."

        The <http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009082401apa&r=1662107-1385&l=003-b13&t=c>Los Angeles Times (8/24, Healy) Booster Shots blog reported that, according to papers published simultaneously on Aug. 21 in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology and in the journal General Hospital Psychiatry, the American Psychiatric Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued "a first-ever set of guidelines" offering "obstetricians and their patients a set of clear road maps for treating depression in pregnancy." The new "guidelines provide a comprehensive review and assessment of the research findings that exist on the risks that antidepressant medications pose for babies before and after birth," while simultaneously taking into account findings suggesting that "having a severely depressed mother can be bad indeed for a baby before and after birth and well into his or her childhood."

        <http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009082401apa&r=1662107-1385&l=004-b65&t=c>WebMD (8/21, Boyles) reported that "the rate of antidepressant use during pregnancy more than doubled between 1999 and 2003," according to a 2003 study that found that "one in eight women took an antidepressant at some point during her pregnancy," with "greater use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants like Prozac [fluoxetine], Paxil [paroxetine], and Zoloft [sertraline]" being "largely responsible for the increase." At that time, these medications "were generally considered safe for pregnant women...but safety concerns soon emerged, especially regarding Paxil," which other studies suggested caused "an increased risk for congenital heart defects in babies born to women who took" the medication during pregnancy. Other studies have linked "SSRI use during pregnancy...to an increased risk for miscarriage, low birth weight, and preterm delivery."

        According to <http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009082401apa&r=1662107-1385&l=005-94d&t=c>Medscape (8/21, Brauser), "After a consultation between their psychiatrist and obstetrician/gynecologist (to discuss risks), psychiatrically stable women who prefer to stay on medication may be able to do so. For those who want to discontinue medication and are not experiencing symptoms, tapering and discontinuation may be attempted," even though "women with a history of recurrent depression are at a high risk for relapse." Women "with recurrent depression or symptoms despite their medication may benefit from psychotherapy to replace or augment medication." Importantly, "women with severe depression should remain on medication . If a patient refuses, alternative treatment and monitoring should be in place, preferably before discontinuation." For pregnant women "who prefer taking medication, risks and benefits of treatment choices should be evaluated and discussed."

APA and ACOG Release Treatment Recommendations

Pregnant women with depression face complicated treatment decisions because of the risks associated with both untreated depression and the use of antidepressants. A new report from The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Psychiatric Association (APA) attempts to help doctors and patients weigh the risks and benefits of various treatment options. Based on an extensive review of existing research, ACOG and APA offer <http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009082401apa&r=1662107-1385&l=006-516&t=c>recommendations for the treatment of women with depression during pregnancy.

Mother describes trauma of her son's schizophrenia.

In an op-ed in the <http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009082401apa&r=1662107-1385&l=007-71e&t=c>Los Angeles Times (8/24), Julia Robinson Shimizu, who serves on the board of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, San Fernando Valley, and a mother of an adult son with schizophrenia, writes: "When our son takes his prescribed psychotropic medications, no one would ever suspect the depth of his illness. But when he is off his meds, he is unable to eat, sleep, bathe, or make sense. He is overtaken by delusions." Ever since he had "his first psychotic break in his freshman year of college," Shimizu's son "has been in and out of hospitals." Recently, "his sixth hospitalization in less than a year" came "just eight days after his previous discharge. At 24, he is no longer covered by" his parents' "insurance, but this may be to his advantage," because he may now be able to "access services through the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health." Shimizu is sharing this story because "giving up the pretense of privacy offers us a chance to be free of the burden and shame of this mystifying illness," and "by being open, we may even be able to help someone."

Small fMRI study indicates depressed people may show less activity in regions of brain involved with experiencing pleasure.

For the study, researchers from Canada's Lawson Health Research Institute "asked 15 non-depressed people and 16 people recently diagnosed with depression for a list of their favorite music and music that they felt neutral about (neither liked nor disliked). Participants then listened to their musical selections for three minutes" while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. The scans revealed that "the non-depressed participants had more neural activity in several areas of the brain associated with reward processing and pleasure than depressed participants did."

That dark irony is finally being acknowledged at the Pentagon, where the Army has announced an ambitious program to train soldiers in the risks of stress, depression, and suicide. On the modern battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, one out of five active or returning soldiers is suffering from these ailments. The Spartan clichÃ© that all a true soldier needs to do is mutely absorb it all is clearly not working." The Times noted that "there are doubters in the military and the psychiatric professions" regarding emotional resiliency training, "but we all need to know whether advance training can ease a soldier's darkest moments."







Key lawmakers urge Obama to scale down healthcare reform plans.

Media reports on the healthcare debate continue to paint a grim picture of the President's reform push. The White House is being cast as beset by conflicting agendas in the House and Senate, and comments Sunday by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-CT) are being interpreted as a signal that Senate moderates may in the end not be on the President's side. A senator "counted on by Democrats in the healthcare debate showed signs of wavering," says the <http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009082401apa&r=1662107-1385&l=00b-b0f&t=c>AP (8/24, Daniel). ABC World News (8/23, story 3, 2:10, Harris), the only network newscast that aired Sunday, reported that the goal of "universal health coverage...seems as illusive as ever." ABC's Cochran added that on the issue of bipartisanship "the President appears to have intentionally sent conflicting signals. Fearful of losing liberals in the House, the White House says he wants an option for government-run insurance. Fearful of losing moderates in the Senate, the President signals he is willing to consider other options."

USA Today adds that "even Democrats in Congress said that whatever healthcare bill emerges this fall will have to cost less than the $1 trillion price tag contemplated earlier this year." Sen. Kent Conrad (D-ND) said on CBS, "It's going to have to be significantly less than what we've heard talked about. ... We've got to have the deficit reduced as a result of this effort. That is absolutely imperative." The "renewed criticism over the healthcare proposals pending in Congress comes as lawmakers hear from angry voters at town-hall-style meetings across the country during the August recess."

They had been depending on the independent senator to support their efforts, even though he often aligns with Republicans." <http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009082401apa&r=1662107-1385&l=00e-5e1&t=c>AFP (8/24) and the <http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009082401apa&r=1662107-1385&l=00f-894&t=c>Wall Street Journal (8/24, A4, Fields) also cover the story.

        Schumer says Democrats mulling go-it-alone strategy. Meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) comments that a Democratic-only bill remains an option are seen as risking further damage to bipartisan support for healthcare reform. On NBC's Meet The Press (8/23, Gregory), Schumer said "we are considering alternatives," when asked whether reconciliation might be used to pass a reform bill. He explained that such alternatives "include just getting 60 Democratic votes and maybe an occasional Republican here or there on a bill if we can't get a bipartisan bill, try as we might. They include looking at reconciliation, which only needs 51, and they include a combination." <http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009082401apa&r=1662107-1385&l=010-e7f&t=c>Bloomberg News (8/24, Przybyla) says that "a move by Democrats to seek a partisan bill may provoke a backlash from Republicans and weaken public support for a healthcare overhaul, Obama's top domestic priority. It might also result in watered-down legislation."

        But, Senate Democrats Sunday "said they were increasingly confident that they could legislate creation of a public plan in a way that would withstand challenges expected from Republicans," the <http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009082401apa&r=1662107-1385&l=011-7f1&t=c>New York Times (8/24, A12, Pear) reports. "Proponents of a public plan say it would drive down costs because it would not have a profit motive and would have lower overhead costs and lower executive salaries than private insurance companies."

Hypochondria seen as unaddressed in healthcare reform debate.

In an op-ed in the <http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009082401apa&r=1662107-1385&l=012-5c6&t=c>Chicago Tribune (8/23), Michael Socolow, an assistant professor of communication and journalism at the University of Maine, wrote that although "hypochondria affects the American healthcare system," it "remains surprisingly unaddressed in the debate over healthcare reform." In 1998, a "study concluded that about three percent of visits to primary-care physicians could be attributed to hypochondria, and another estimated that about a quarter of all patients report symptoms with no apparent physical basis." According to Jerome Groopman, MD, of Harvard Medical School, an "estimated $20 billion a year is spent on patients whose psychological distress requires repeated tests and procedures." But, with "little hard data, it is impossible to discern whether Americans are particularly prone to hypochondria or whether rates of hypochondria are increasing." Meanwhile, "imaginary illnesses, mystical ailments, and vague complaints with no physical basis" are costing money. Therefore, the US will have to "move past" its "discomfort and address the economic ramifications of hypochondria -- even if it makes us feel queasy."

The hospital is currently "creating one of the first comprehensive programs in the nation to provide specialized medical care to adults with autism, a group whose numbers are poised to surge as tens of thousands of children diagnosed with the developmental disorder grow up." The foundation's gift "will also allow the hospital to expand its services for children with autism, who now wait up to a year for an appointment, conduct extensive research, advocate for patients, and train physicians."

Investigators "evaluated 1998-2005 data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers." Over "that time, nationwide calls related to teen abuse of AD/HD" medicines, "specifically stimulants, increased from 330 to 581 yearly, and there were four deaths." Altogether, "42 percent of teens involved had moderate to severe side-effects and most ended up getting emergency-[department] treatment." The AP adds, "The surge, from 1998 to 2005, outpaced calls for teen substance abuse generally," paralleling "an 86 percent rise in AD/HD medicine prescriptions for kids aged 10 to 19, from about four million to nearly eight million during that time."

Column discusses "brain training" to prevent mental decline.

Chris Woolston writes in the <http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009082401apa&r=1662107-1385&l=016-cb5&t=c>Los Angeles Times (8/24) Healthy Skeptic column that many aging Americans have "turned to 'brain training' in an attempt to stop their mental decline. Such games and devices are specifically marketed as a way to keep brains sharp and youthful, working the gray matter with a variety of challenges...that take users beyond their usual thought processes." People assume that "working out the brain is a lot like working out the body: If they can get enough of the right kinds of exercise, they'll be mentally stronger and fitter as the years pass." But, according to Liz Zelinski, PhD, of the University of Southern California, "a brain game or any other activity can't improve thinking or turn back the mental clock unless it's both challenging and novel enough to build new connections between brain cells." Therefore, "the challenge for brain trainers is to go beyond typical games and brain teasers to give the brain the type of exercise it needs to really grow."

        Physical exercise may be as important as mental exercise for brain health, neuropsychologist says. The <http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009082401apa&r=1662107-1385&l=017-152&t=c>Los Angeles Times (8/24, Woolston) reports that, according to a study published in the April issue of Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, "Zelinski and a team of other researchers recently tested the Brain Fitness computer program on a group of nearly 500 mentally sharp seniors 65 and older. ... Half of the group used the program one hour a day, five days a week, for eight weeks," while "the other half spent an equal amount of time watching educational DVDs and answering quizzes about the shows." They found that "the Brain Fitness group had better attention and memory than the DVD group" in follow-up tests. Even so, "a good pair of walking shoes might be a better investment than a brain game. 'There's a lot of evidence that physical exercise is just as important as mental exercise for brain health,'" said neuropsychologist Glenn Smith, of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine.

Researchers disrupt long-term memory formation in rats by interfering with dopamine.

<http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009082401apa&r=1662107-1385&l=018-c96&t=c>HealthDay (8/21, Perkel) reported that, according to research published Aug. 21 in the journal Science, South American researchers "demonstrated in rats that it is possible to disrupt long-term storage of certain memories, assuming that intervention occurs at the right time." The team "attempted to prevent long-term memory formation by interfering with the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is associated with pleasurable and painful stimuli. If a blocker for the dopamine receptor was injected into the hypothalamus of the brain" of rats 12 hours after receiving a painful "shock -- but not immediately after the shock or nine hours later -- the rats effectively forgot about the experience." HealthDay noted that this "effect depended on the activity of a specific brain protein called BDNF, and on interaction of the hypothalamus with another brain region called the ventral-tegmental area."

Moderate drinking in people over 60 may reduce risk for Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, researchers say.

For the study, researchers "reviewed 15 studies that together followed more than 28,000 subjects for at least two years. ... The studies variously defined light to moderate drinking as one to 28 drinks per week." The investigators found that, "compared with abstainers, male drinkers reduced their risk for dementia by 45 percent, and women by 27 percent." The findings add to a body of "evidence from other studies that moderate alcohol consumption can increase HDL, or 'good cholesterol,' improve blood flow to the brain, and decrease blood coagulation," all of which "may reduce the risk for dementia."

Study indicates teens with minor depression may face higher risk of mental health problems later in life.

<http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009090101apa&r=1662107-6d70&l=006-40f&t=c>BBC News (8/31) reported that, according to a study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, adolescents "who have minor depression are at a higher risk of mental health problems later in life." For the study, "psychiatrists at Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute" interviewed "750 14 to 16-year-olds who were then assessed again as adults." The investigators discovered that "anxiety, severe depression, and eating disorders were all far more common in 20 and 30-year-olds who had had minor depression as adolescents." Specifically, "by the time they got to their 20s and 30s, the risk of them having major depression was four times higher than those who did not have signs of minor depression at the first interview." In addition, "there was a two-and-a-half times increased risk of agoraphobia, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder, and a threefold risk of anorexia or bulimia."

Researchers associate specific gene to substance-dependence comorbidity in women of European origin.

Yale University researchers based their study "on 1,393 women of European origin who were selected from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE) database." Next, the team "conducted a genome-wide association study of a composite substance-dependence phenotype derived from six individual addiction diagnoses: nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, opiates, and other drugs as a whole." The investigators "identified a strong (odds ratio = 1.77) and significant association between substance abuse in white women and the PKNOX2 gene on chromosome 11."

Risk for violence in schizophrenia may be attributable to comorbid substance abuse, research suggests.

For the study, researchers from Sweden's Karolinska Institute reviewed "20 studies comparing the risk for violence or violent crime in" 18,423 "individuals with schizophrenia and other psychoses and in" 1,714,904 "individuals from the general population." The investigators found that "the effects of comorbid substance abuse was marked with the random-effects odds ratios of 2.1 without comorbidity and an odds ratio of 8.9 with comorbidity." Study author Martin Grann, PhD, stated that the study "highlights the 'critical need' for clinicians to address issues of substance and alcohol abuse in this patient population."

Massachusetts to scale back health coverage for legal immigrants.

Deval Patrick (D) <http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009090101apa&r=1662107-6d70&l=00b-544&t=c>announced Monday. He said his administration "had struggled to find a solution 'that preserves the promise of healthcare reform' after the state legislature cut most of the $130 million it had previously allotted immigrants, to help close a budget deficit." Patrick described the new coverage "as comprehensive," saying it "could be a model for less-expensive state-subsidized benefits." Notably, under the "1996 federal law that overhauled the nation's welfare system, the 31,000 affected immigrants do not qualify for Medicaid or other federal aid. Massachusetts is one of the few states -- others are California, New York, and Pennsylvania -- that provide at least some health coverage for such immigrants."

Montana's "highest court on Wednesday will take up" a patient's "claim that a doctor's refusal to help him die violated his rights under Montana's Constitution -- and lawyers on both sides say the chances are good that he will prevail." The Times notes that "the question will be decided by the seven-member State Supreme Court. A lower-court judge ruled in" the patient's "favor last December -- on the very day" he died -- "and the State of Montana appealed the ruling." At present, "Washington and Oregon allow physicians to help terminally ill people hasten their deaths, but...neither state's highest court has examined the issue of a constitutional right to die."

Research indicates retail medical clinics may offer low-cost care at similar quality to physicians' offices.

<http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009090101apa&r=1662107-6d70&l=00e-77d&t=c>Bloomberg News (9/1, Tirrell) reports, "Medical clinics found in stores such as CVS Caremark Corp. offer a similar quality of service to physicians' offices and urgent-care centers, for prices as much as a third less," according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The researchers noted that such clinics "increased more than 10-fold from 2006 to 2008," providing care for "a patient population that's not frequently going to a primary care physician." For the study, researchers "examined more than 15,000" patients "in Minnesota between 2005 and 2006." Researchers found that "the average cost of care at a retail clinic was $110, compared with $166 at doctors' offices, $156 at urgent-care centers, and $570 at emergency rooms."

        Retail medical clinics "have been roundly criticized by many doctors who say they fear care will be inferior to what is provided in traditional settings," according to the <http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009090101apa&r=1662107-6d70&l=00f-846&t=c>Los Angeles Times (8/31, Roan) Booster Shots. But, the study showed that there were "no differences...in the quality of care in patient visiting retail clinics compared to doctors' offices and urgent care centers." Notably, "retail clinics performed slightly better than hospital emergency rooms." The work "also addressed a criticism that people who visit retail clinics might skimp on preventive medical care."

        But, the researchers said that when they compared that aspect "of care in retail clinics, physician offices, urgent care centers, and emergency departments," they "found little evidence to support" the concern, <http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009090101apa&r=1662107-6d70&l=010-205&t=c>HealthDay (8/31, West) reported.

For the study, "researchers focused on 14,000 'binge drinkers' -- people who said that at least once month they had five or more drinks on a single occasion." The study showed that "about 12 percent said they had gone driving within two hours of their last bout of heavy drinking," and "of those drivers, more than half took the wheel after drinking in a bar, restaurant or other licensed establishment." Data also indicated that "half of the drivers who left an establishment said they had seven or more drinks; a quarter said they had had at least 10." The researchers noted that the findings suggest "a need for stepped-up efforts to prevent bars and restaurants from serving people after they're intoxicated."

Specifically, the report found that "Dallas had the highest percentage of teen births that are repeat births -- 28 percent -- among 73 major US cities in 2006, the latest year for which city-level data are available." In fact, "Texas has the highest repeat rate of any state -- 23 percent of teen births," and "five of the 15 worst-ranked cities are in Texas," according to the report. The Morning News adds, "The findings could spark more local and statewide debate of abstinence-only sex education. They also raise questions about availability of contraceptives and whether other strategies may slow teenage girls from giving birth again and again, which can end their schooling, strain social services, and reinforce a cycle of poverty."

Airline industry takes swine flu precautions.

NBC Nightly News (8/31, story 6, 2:50, Williams) reported, "The inside of a plane has been called a high-risk environment for swine flu," noting that "for now, neither the World Health Organization nor the Centers for Disease Control recommend restrictions on travel in response to the swine flu pandemic." However, "The danger is not the air. The cabin air in planes is steadily replenished from the outside, even in high altitudes and re-circulates through filters that can trap most virus-containing particles." Instead, "Experts say the biggest danger is having a sick person cough or sneeze almost directly on nearby passengers." CDC official Dr. Daniel Jernigan is shown saying, "Certainly that's a setting where there's a lot of chance for getting an infection." NBC adds that the airline industry "is in constant contact with the federal government about contingency plans, what might need to be done if the epidemic becomes severe."

Instead, "several US carriers emphasize they'll follow long-standing policies that permit them to keep an ill person from flying, whatever the sickness." Other airlines "say they'll continue precautions - such as offering passengers anti-bacterial wipes and keeping blankets and pillows off planes - they began in the spring when the flu strain emerged."

"Instead of being based on Zagat-style blurbs, self-selected and anonymous, this model uses surveys." The organization's pilot program began "in Denver, Memphis, and the Kansas City area, [where] the organization polled patients who had seen their doctor in the last year, randomly selecting them from a database of insurance company claim forms." In Kansas City, for instance, "this resulted in an average of 58 ratings for each of 710 doctors, mostly primary-care physicians." The group "assigns each doctor an overall rating, on a scale of 0 to 100, and also shows how he or she performed on specific survey questions."

Difference in sleep quality could be adaptations to environmental demands, research suggests.

But the "answer may boil down to time management, according to a new paper in the August issue of the journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience." Investigators at the University of California-Los Angeles "argue that sleep evolved to optimize animals' use of time, keeping them safe and hidden when the hunting, fishing, or scavenging was scarce and perhaps risky." In other words, "differences in sleep quality, up to and including periods of insomnia, need not be seen as problems but as adaptations to the demands of the environment," says lead investigator Jerome Siegel, a professor of psychiatry. He added, "We spend a third of our life sleeping, and it seems so maladaptive." But "another way of looking at it is this: unnecessary wakefulness is a bigger mistake."

Researchers say higher positive symptom scores in children, adolescents with first-episode psychosis may be associated with cannabis use.

For the study, researchers from Spain's Hospital Clinic Universitari "administered the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia...the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), and a range of other measures to 110 first-episode psychosis patients aged nine to 17 years at baseline and after six months." Next, "dividing the patients into 32 cannabis users and 78 non-cannabis users, the team found that cannabis users" had "significantly higher PANSS positive scores, as well as lower PANSS negative, general, and total scores than non-users." Then, "dividing cannabis users at six months into 16 previous and 15 current users," the investigators discovered that "previous users had the best overall outcome, non-users the worst outcome, and current users an intermediate outcome."

Early age of bipolar disorder onset may be associated with worse outcomes, research suggests.

For the study, researchers from Australia's Monash University examined data on "239 participants in the Bipolar Comprehensive Outcomes Study," assessing the patients with "the Young Mania rating Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impressions Scale, Short Form-36, SLICE/Life Scale, and the EuroQol." The investigators found that "patients with an early age of onset had significantly more severe depressive symptoms and higher rates of suicidal ideation than other patients." In addition, "early onset patients...were also more likely to experience a depressive first episode than other patients." The authors also reported that "early onset patients had more frequent psychologic distress, and subsequent social and role disability than other patients, and were more dissatisfied with their lives."

Government and Psychiatry

Researchers encountering shortage of willing participants for study on veterans.

The <http://mailview.custombriefings.com/mailview.aspx?m=2009082501apa&r=1662107-d230&l=00e-d5f&t=c>Boston Globe (8/24, Bender) reported, "Researchers testing ways to treat the psychological wounds of war among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are encountering...a shortage of willing study participants. A strong stigma in the military associated" with post-traumatic stress disorder "is blamed for the reluctance of combat veterans to take part in a pair of treatment programs being evaluated by staff from the Veterans Administration," according to study directors. Both "the VA and the Pentagon hope the studies will lead to a standard intervention when veterans and returning soldiers exhibit signs of post-battle stress, reducing domestic abuse and other violence." To date, since "recruiting began at the beginning of the year, only 10 couples have signed up for the first study" featuring intensive couples counseling, "far short of the 440 needed, according to officials." Meanwhile, out "of 135 male veterans needed for the second study" on anger management, "only 13 have been accepted so far."

<http://www.miwatch.org/2009/09/off_label_drugs_at_va_increase.html>Off label antipsychotic drugs increased at VA

A <http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/60/9/1175>study appearing in Psychiatric Services describes a hike in prescribing antipsychotic medications over a ten-year period at the Veterans Administration. Sixty percent of antipsychotic drugs were prescribed off-label for patients with a diagnosis other than schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. The authors were cautious, noting:

The benefits of such off-label use are usually unclear because there has not been a high level of published clinical research evaluating the safety and efficacy of these drugs for non-FDA-approved indications. Although some off-label use of second-generation antipsychotics may be appropriate, these drugs are expensive and have serious side effects (including weight gain, diabetes mellitus, tardive dyskinesia, and extrapyramidal symptoms), and their off-label use may therefore represent significant risk and cost with undemonstrated clinical benefit and potential harm.

These findings follow the recently published report in <http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/66/8/848>Archives of General Psychiatry show similar hikes in the use of antidepressants, making them the "most commonly prescribed class of medications in the United States."

Chronic health problems associated with mental illnesses and substance use disorders underscore the need for coordination between psychiatry and primary care providers. Yet shortages of primary care physicians have made it difficult for people needing regular check ups to prevent or monitor diabetes, heart diseases, and cancer -- all leading to an average 25-years shorter life expectancy -- are well known. An informal, unscientific poll of MIWatch readers indicates three out of four do not have primary care involvement. The...

worldwide significancy of depression!

Depression Looms As Global Crisis
BBC News September 2nd 2009

The World Health Organization predicts that within 20 years more people will be affected by depression than any other health problem.

According to the WHO, depression will be the biggest health burden on society both economically and sociologically.

Yet, it says most developing countries spend less than 2% of their national budgets on mental healthcare.

The warning comes as the first Global Mental Health Summit starts in Athens, Greece.

WHO figures reveal that currently, over 450 million people are directly affected by mental disorders or disabilities, most of whom live in
developing countries.

The five-day summit in Athens will provide the opportunity to address what the organizers are calling a crisis in global mental healthcare.

"WHO figures clearly show that the burden because of depression is likely to increase - so much so that in 2030 this will be the single biggest cause for
burden out of all health conditions," Dr Shekhar Saxena of the Department of Mental Health at the WHO, told the BBC World Service.

The scientific concept of "burden" is the measure of years lost of life, due to early death or severe disability brought on by a certain illness, in this
case depression.

Silent Epidemic

Dr Saxena says depression is much more common than some other diseases that are more widely feared such as HIV-Aids or cancer.

"One could call it a silent epidemic because depression is more often being recognized, but it has been there throughout and is likely to increase in
terms of proportion when other diseases are actually going down."

The increasing burden will be a particular problem for developing countries because they have fewer resources to allocate to mental health.

"We have figures to show that poorer countries have actually more depression compared to richer countries and even poor people in rich countries have a
high incidence of depression compared to the richer people in the same countries," says Dr Saxena.

Yet high-income countries allocate 200 times more resources to mental health than low-income ones.

It accounts not only for a significant proportion of government spending in developed countries, it also makes a impact on their GDP as well.

Professor Martin Prince, professor of epidemiological psychiatry at King's College, London has tried to calculate in financial terms how much of a
burden a depressed person can become.

"Part of this is through lost productivity because people with serious depression are much less likely to be employed and to stay employed. Then
there's the cost to society of providing, for example, incapacity and unemployment benefits, particularly in rich developed countries," he says.

"These costs combined amount in the UK, it's estimated, to about Â£12bn ($19bn) per year or around 1% of the gross national product, so these are
absolutely enormous sums."

With the expectation that the burden from mental illness is going up and will continue to increase in coming years, Dr Saxena says societal attitudes
towards mental illness need to change.

"Depression is as much of a disease as any other physical disease that people suffer from and they have a right to get correct advice and treatment
with in the same health care settings which look after other health conditions."

The Silent Epidemic

* About half of mental disorders begin before the age of 14

* Around 20% of the world's children and adolescents are estimated to have mental disorders or problems

* Most low- and middle-income countries have only one child psychiatrist for every 1 to 4 million people

* About 800,000 people commit suicide every year, 86% of them in low-and middle-income countries

* More than half of the people who kill themselves are aged between 15 and 44

* The highest suicide rates are found among men in eastern European countries.

Dissociative Identity Disorder

You may have heard the term Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD). Today, it's referred to as <http://click.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=1062668535&msgid=31089431&act=U7WM&c=55391&admin=0&destination=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.healthyplace.com%2Fabuse%2Fdissociative-identity-disorder%2Fwhat-is-dissociative-identity-disorder%2Fmenu-id-57%2F>Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). DID is characterized by multiple distinct identities or personalities (known as alters) in a single individual, each with its own pattern of perceiving and interacting with the environment.

One of the HealthyPlace members with Dissociative Identity Disorder described it to me as feeling like you're sharing your body with other people who live inside you.

Dissociative Identity Disorder is a controversial diagnosis. Many psychiatrists don't even believe it exists and if it does exist, mental health professionals (and DID patients themselves) argue over whether or not it can be, or should be, cured.

Antipsychotic Lurasidone shows promise in phase 3 trial



(8/27/2009)


Press Release



Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd., (DSP) announced positive results from its phase 3 clinical trial of lurasidone, an atypical antipsychotic medication, for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In this trial, both lurasidone 40 and 120 mg/day were significantly more effective than placebo for the treatment of schizophrenia. Lurasidone was well-tolerated with an overall discontinuation rate that was similar to placebo.

â€œWe are pleased with the results of this study as these data reinforce our belief that lurasidone will be an important treatment option for patients with schizophrenia,â€ said Masayo Tada, president and chief executive officer, Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd. â€œWe plan to submit our NDA filing package for lurasidone to the U.S. FDA in early 2010.â€

The company's phase 3 clinical development program, involving more than 2,000 patients worldwide, is intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lurasidone for the treatment of schizophrenia. The latest trial, called PEARL 2, was a double-blind, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 478 inpatients with acute schizophrenia that were randomized to receive either lurasidone 40 or 120 mg/day, olanzapine 15 mg/day or placebo for six weeks. The active comparator, olanzapine, was used for purposes of establishing assay sensitivity.

Lurasidone 40 and 120 mg, taken once-daily, demonstrated significantly greater improvement versus placebo on the primary efficacy measure, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score, at study endpoint. PANSS score changes from baseline for lurasidone 40 and 120 mg/day versus placebo were -25.7 and -23.6 vs. -16.0, respectively, at study endpoint. A total of 53% of patients on lurasidone 40 mg/day and 47% of patients on lurasidone 120 mg/day demonstrated a 30% or more improvement on the PANSS total score from baseline versus 38% on placebo.

In addition, both lurasidone dose groups were significantly more effective than placebo on the Clinical Global Impressions Severity scale (CGI-S), the key secondary efficacy endpoint. The CGI-S score changes from baseline for lurasidone 40 and 120 mg/day versus placebo were -1.5 and -1.4 vs. -1.1, respectively, at study endpoint.

â€œPatients with schizophrenia and their health care providers are in need of new treatment options that provide consistent efficacy with a lower impact on weight, lipids, and movement disorders,â€ said Herbert Meltzer, M.D., a study investigator and professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. â€œLurasidone appears to be a potentially significant new treatment option for schizophrenia.â€

The effect of lurasidone on weight was similar to placebo [median weight change: 0.9 kg (2 lbs) for 40 mg/day, 0.5 kg (1.1lbs) for 120 mg/day vs. 0 kg for placebo at study endpoint]. The incidence of clinically significant weight gain (â‰¥7% increase from baseline to study endpoint) was 7.6% for lurasidone 40 mg/day, 4.2% for lurasidone 120 mg/day and 7.0% for placebo.

Changes in total cholesterol and other lipid measurements for both lurasidone doses (40 and 120 mg/day) were similar to placebo (median change: total cholesterol -8.0 mg/dL and -5.0 mg/dL vs. -5.0 mg/dL placebo; and triglycerides -3.0 mg/dL and 4.5 mg/dL vs. -1.0 mg/dL placebo, respectively, at study endpoint).

â€œPEARL 2 data are consistent with previous lurasidone placebo-controlled studies and underscore the potential of lurasidone to effectively treat patients with schizophrenia,â€ said Antony Loebel, M.D., vice president of clinical research, Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma America, Inc.

Lurasidone was also well-tolerated with an overall discontinuation rate similar to placebo (40% vs. 39% placebo) and few adverse event-related discontinuations (9% for both the overall lurasidone group and placebo). Adverse events seen in the trial were generally mild. The most commonly reported adverse events for lurasidone 40 and 120 mg/day combined (greater than 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) were akathisia (17.3% vs. 0.9% placebo), somnolence (12.2% vs. 4.3% placebo), sedation (11.4% vs. 3.4% placebo), parkinsonism (10.1% vs. 1.7% placebo), nausea (9.3% vs. 4.3% placebo), and dystonia (5.5% vs. 0.9% placebo).

Olanzapine 15 mg/day produced significantly greater improvements than placebo on both the PANSS total score (-28.7 vs. -16.0 placebo) and CGI-S (-1.5 vs. -1.1 placebo). A total of 64% of patients on olanzapine demonstrated a 30% or more improvement on the PANSS total score from baseline versus 38% on placebo. Patients on olanzapine reported a 3.1 kg (6.8 lbs) increase in median weight gain at study endpoint. The incidence of clinically significant weight gain (â‰¥7% increase from baseline to study endpoint) for olanzapine was 34.4% vs. 7.0% placebo.

Olanzapine-treated patients had a greater increase in lipid parameters versus placebo (median change: total cholesterol 9.0 mg/dL vs. -5.0 mg/dL placebo; and triglycerides 24.0 mg/dL vs. -1.0 mg/dL placebo at study endpoint). The most commonly reported adverse events for olanzapine (greater than 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) were increased weight (20.5% vs. 5.2% placebo), sedation (13.9% vs. 3.4% placebo), dry mouth (9.8% vs. 0.9% placebo), somnolence (9.0% vs. 4.3% placebo) and akathisia (7.4% vs. 0.9% placebo).

The company has submitted the results of the trial for presentation at a scientific meeting at the end of this year.

PEARL 2 Study Overview
This randomized, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational clinical trial was conducted at 52 sites worldwide primarily in hospital settings. Twenty-five sites in the United States randomized 286 patients, 18 sites in Asia randomized 115 patients, five sites in South America randomized 48 patients and four sites in Europe randomized 29 patients.

Patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia (using DSM-IV criteria) and were required to have an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms with a PANSS total score of 80 or higher at study baseline. Trial participants had a mean age of 37.7 years with an average PANSS score of 96.6 at baseline. Patients had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, on average, for more than 13 years and most had been previously hospitalized prior to entering the study. Multiple safety assessments were done, including vital signs, weight, ECGs, movement disorder scales (SAS, BAS, AIMS), and laboratory assessments.

About Lurasidone
Lurasidone is an atypical antipsychotic discovered and developed by DSP with a unique chemical structure. Lurasidone has high affinities for dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT7, 5-HT2A, 5-HT1A, and noradrenalin Î±2C receptors and minimal-to-no affinity for histamine H1 or cholinergic M1 receptors.


Abuse of OTC meds common, deadly for people with eating disorders




Abuse of OTC meds common, deadly for people with eating disorders




(8/27/2009)


Press Release



Between 11 and 13 million people in the U.S. have eating disorders and at least one million will die from their disorder.  It is not unusual for women and girls struggling with eating disorders to either abuse or become dependent on over-the-counter (OTC) substances.

"It may surprise many people, including some healthcare providers, that over-the-counter products and supplements for dieting purposes are frequently abused by those with eating disorders," said Kevin Wandler, MD, of Remuda Ranch Programs for Eating and Anxiety Disorders.  "A full 64 percent of eating disorder patients abuse diet pills.  The health consequences of diet pill abuse are enormous and include high blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythms, tremors, thickening of the heart muscle, and kidney damage."

Other substances abused by individuals with eating disorders include:

* Alcohol - Typically individuals with anorexia don't consume alcohol, due to its high calorie content. However, for people with bulimia and a sub-group of those with anorexia who also binge and purge, alcohol is frequently consumed, then eliminated through vomiting.
* Caffeine - It's consumed in the form of black coffee or diet drinks to fill the stomach and it staves off hunger. Caffeine also serves as a diuretic, and people with eating disorders confuse temporary fluid loss with actual weight loss.  In addition, those with bulimia in general use liquids because self-induced vomiting is easier when the stomach is full of fluid.
* Amphetamines and Cocaine - These substances are used because they suppress appetite and provide energy in the absence of adequate food intake.
* Nicotine - Nicotine is an appetite suppressant that can increase metabolism in females as much as 10 percent. It's not uncommon for girls with eating disorders to take up smoking to control appetite in an effort to lose unwanted pounds.
* Laxatives, Diuretics and Over-the-counter Diet Pills - Like so many over-the-counter medications, these drugs are intended to address a specific medical need during a limited time frame. Although laxatives and diuretics are not often considered drugs of abuse or dependence, individuals can become dependent on them. With prolonged use, users can develop tolerance and withdrawal. A recent study found that in a sample of 200 bulimics, 31 percent used diuretics.
"It can take the body months to recover from laxative and other over-the-counter substance abuse," adds Dr. Wandler. "It's important to get professional help before the abuse escalates."





Policy confusion threatens Medicaid-funded children's mental health programs



(9/2/2009)


Press Release



WASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ States have continued to implement Bush-era Medicaid policies on childrenâ€™s mental health despite a decision by the Obama administration to reverse those policies, according to a new report released today by the Alliance for Children and Families, a coalition of nonprofit health care providers for children in the child welfare system.  The Alliance estimates that left unaddressed, the ongoing implementation of the Bush policies could reduce needed mental health care for tens of thousands of children across the nation.

The report found that states are continuing to implement Bush administration policies that limited funding for mental health services for foster children with serious emotional disturbances.  These services, including therapeutic foster care (TFC), are covered by Medicaid in most states. 

The Bush administration began restricting these services in some states in 2003 and continued the restrictions throughout the 2000s, even after Congress blocked their implementation.  When President Obama entered office, he rolled back regulations limiting these Medicaid services.  However, due to a combination of state momentum and incomplete reversals of the Bush policies by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), their implementation has continued. 

Nonprofit child welfare providers report that the continuation of the Bush-era restrictions has resulted in serious harm to foster children and to state child welfare systems.  Normer Adams, Executive Director of the Georgia Association of Homes and Services for Children, described the implementation of the policies in Georgia as â€œlike a bomb was set off in our child welfare system.â€œ 

In Colorado, â€œour state system is crippled right now.  It is in fiscal crisis,â€ stated Dr. Skip Barber, Executive Director of the Colorado Association of Family and Childrenâ€™s Agencies.

Ongoing implementation of the Bush policies has also resulted in poorer health outcomes for children and increases in community violence.  â€œThe continuation of these Bush Medicaid policies is harming vulnerable childrenâ€™s health,â€œ said Patrick Lester, Senior Vice President of Public Policy for the Alliance.  â€œWe understand that policy changes take time for any new administration to implement, but it is far past time for CMS to act.â€

The report compiled information on nineteen states from 2003 to the present.  During this period, twelve of the states had implemented the Bush policies or had begun doing so, even after Congress passed a law in 2007 blocking the restrictions from taking effect.  States report that without a clear reversal of policy from CMS, they feel compelled to continue with the changes or risk being found to be out of compliance with federal Medicaid law.  The result has been widespread funding cuts to therapeutic services.

The report describes several policy options for CMS and Congress to halt the ongoing implementation of the Bush policies.  These include written guidance from CMS approving therapeutic foster care as a Medicaid-reimbursable service, which would give states immediate relief from the Bush policies.  To permanently ensure statesâ€™ ability to cover such services, Congress could consider including them in health reform as Medicaid-reimbursable services.  Congress may also opt to enact the Medicaid Services Restoration Act (S. 1217), which creates a new category of Medicaid funding for therapeutic foster care and expressly permits states to use â€œreasonableâ€ payment methodologies (including daily bundled payments) for rehabilitative services.

"I wish Eating Disorder Hope existed when I was struggling with an eating disorder," said Jenni Schaefer, author of Life Without Ed: How One Woman Declared Independence from Her Eating Disorder and How You Can Too.  "I felt lost and like no one understood what I was going through.  With just one click, Eating Disorder Hope gives people touched by eating disorders much needed support Â­ letting them know that theyÂ¹re not alone, that there is hope, and most of all that people can and do fully recover."

The work of <http://www.eatingdisorderhope.com>www.eatingdisorderhope.com, which is based in Fort Worth, Texas, is possible due to the support of sponsors including platinum sponsoring partner: Rader Programs; platinum sponsors, Remuda Ranch and Rogers Memorial; and silver sponsor, Linden Oaks at Edward.

"Eating Disorder Hope is a one-stop source for the best information about eating disorders on the Internet," said Sari Shepphird, psychologist, eating disorder specialist and author of 100 Questions and Answers About Anorexia Nervosa.  "It is one of the most trustworthy and informative Web sites available today."

As long as we are invisible the world can, and will, continue to pretend that we do not exist.  The world will ignore us and our needs.  We must all become visible as people who are ill.  Only then will they believe we exist.  The world has lost the ability to grasp what cannot be seen and feel compassion for what they do not understand!

Dear Gov. Perdue,
I hope that while you are enjoying the Mountains in our state.  I do  
hope you are working on what you need to do about Mental Health?  
Health Care on any level is most important.  Don't forget our Vets  
too.   You realize that Health care is more important than schools and  
roads?   We need help and we need it bad in Rutherford County, NC.    
What are you going to do about this?  Reply requested.

Sincerely,

John Barry Logan,

The currently available, 40-year-old anthrax vaccine, can prevent disease, but it has significant drawbacks: Immunity is temporary, and five injections over the course of eighteen months are needed to sustain it; one in five vaccine recipients develop redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site, and a small number develop severe allergic reactions; researchers offer a better vaccine

Hello,

Palmyra is a North Carolina citizen and has been through a lot recently. But this isn't all about her - itâ€™s about one of the biggest problems facing America today.

Let me start off by saying that she has (without question) been a huge supporter of President Obama and was pleased to spend a little time with him. Please see the attached picture of Palmyra with the President - she is on the right. I guess you can figure out her political affiliation, but that is not relevant. It's about who we are and what we do. Although Palmyra has been through some difficult health challenges, she is still willing to help President Obama with his efforts on health care reform. Her story would benefit those for Health Care Reform and those against it may change their mind.

To help cover some of her medical expenses, her family and the friends she's touched have banded together to do a Benefit Concert on September 15,  2009.  Please visit <http://www.palmyrabenefit.org/>www.palmyrabenefit.org now to learn more about this event and why she is so loved.

Many are expected to attend this event and your contributions, efforts, and presence would be appreciated. We anticipate a large crowd and many radio and TV stations promoting and telling Palmyra's story - so show up early. Please contact Jon Stickley at <mailto:jon.stickley@gmail.com>jon.stickley@gmail.com for more information.

Thank you for caring!



Joe Billingsley

Following is the question just received:
Visitor: Mr. Alan Crighton

Address: 1205 Fairfax Woods Drive, Apex, NC 27502

Email: alan.crighton@fci.com

Subject: Sensorship of the President of the United States

Comment: Dear Goveror Perdue, I urge you to have the NC Dept of Public Instruction provide a full and detailed expalantion of why they have (effectively) sensored the upcoming presidential address, the email chain below states what I have already communicated to the Dept, along with Rep. Stam and Stevens. I look forward to hearing from your office Regards Alan Crighton ---------------- Dear Mr. Stevens & Mr. Stam, As a concerned resident of NC, Iâ€™m shocked at the effective sensorship of the upcoming Presidential address planned for next Tuesday, Sept 8th. NC Dept. of Public Instruction issued a press release today (link below) stating participation is optional, with schools already deciding not to show it. Reference my earlier email to NC Dept of Public Instruction, below. Why is the presidential address being effectively sensored in this manner? Why was the press release issued on a Friday before a vacation weekend, effectively ensuring nobody could do anything about it? Why is it the customary â€˜opt-outâ€™ has been ignored in favor of sensorship? I urge you to look into this matter and provide an explanation why (a) a decision has been made to sensor the President of the United States, (2) why the NC Dept. of Public Instruction issued itâ€™s press release on a Friday before a vacation weekend, effectively allowing no challenge to be made to this decision, and (3) why parents were not allowed an opportunity to either opt-in, or opt-out. I look forward to hearing from you. http://www.dpi.state.nc.us/newsroom/news/2009-10/20090904-01 Sincerely Alan Crighton 1205 Fairfax Woods Drive Apex, NC 27502 Tel: 919-387-6630 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- From: Crighton, Alan Sent: Friday, September 04, 2009 5:36 PM To: 'rgarland@dpi.state.nc.us' Subject: Presidential Address Next Week Importance: High Dear Rebecca, To my utmost dismay, I learned today of the decision made by the NC Department of Public Instruction that the Presidential address scheduled for Tuesday, Sept 8th has been deemed an â€˜instruction optionâ€™. I further learned that participation in this event is a local decision, and that my local elementary school has already determined it will not participate. A presidential address should be welcomed by our school system, irrespective of who is in the White House, and for those who do not want their children to participate should be allowed to opt out, just in the same manner as any other school activity. It would appear to me that this decision has been based on political grounds, and your department has succumbed to the pressures of a very vocal minority. Furthermore, your department issued itâ€™s press release only today, with the following Monday being a vacation day, this of course does not offer anyone any opportunity to challenge the decision. As a taxpayer, and a parent of school aged children, I want my children to hear what the president has to say, without the need for me to be forced to record it for them. This decision has effectively censored the President of the United States, only to satisfy a minority of people. If I recall correctly, there have been other presidential addresses which have not been sensored in this manner. I urge you to reconsider your departments direction to sensor the President of the United States. I will be contacting my local representatives and governor regarding this matter. Sincerely Alan Crighton 1205 Fairfax Woods Drive Apex, NC 27502 Tel: 919-387-6630

We don't need a government health  care insurance plan-we need to reform the health,drug insurance companies.They must sell insurance to all know matter what,Every individual pays the same premium as a group plan premium,if not that is discrimination.The health,drug insurance companies have gave huge donation to congress and got laws passed to favor them.Drug makers are the biggest thief's in the country-they spend more on advertizing than research and get there drug ideals from colleges and pay them around 170,000 dollars and then turn it in to a drug,they change the color or shape of a pill so they don't lose the patent on it-that's very wrong.Congress need to reform the insurance and drug makers.People who make 35,000 a year should have to buy health insurance,too many people who can afford insurance just thinks nothing is going to happen to them and those who can afford it must buy it or be taxed pretty good so they will buy insurance at a group price on the premium.Illegal aliens have put a massive burden on our health care system,hospitals etc.They sneak in our country,have a anchor baby then get all the social services and there draining it dry.99 percent of Americans want all illegal's deported but congress will not do any thing about it just to get the Hispanic vote-that is treason of congress not protecting our border and deporting illegal's who have no right to be here.Congress get's huge donations from drug,health insurance companies to get laws passed to favor them.Drug makers are stealing money from the people,Medicaid,Medicare and insurance companies.Make laws as where a individuals pay the same rate for insurance as a group rate,insurance companies making individual pay more for a premium is discrimination-there both getting the same policy-that is so wrong.Reform the insurance companies and the drug makers-there is where the problem is and many people who could get the same rate on premiums as a group rate would buy insurance.Those who can afford insurance must buy it or get a insurance tax on them.Congress works for-we the people not those who donate huge sums of money to congress.I think that know lobbyist,special interest,companies-can not donate any money to congress,the only money that congress or any political person can only get money donation from the American citizens and know more than 100 dollars-there is to much money buying politicians and favors and you know that is true,we need to take the influence of companies,lobbyist,special interest out of politics and you know good and well that is the truth.The American people know it and it needs to be stopped and let our elected officials work for-we the people and not where they get huge amount of money from.I'm sick of money ruling this country and you know it's so true.This government needs to deport all illegal aliens and stop the invasion of illegals-they have hurt this country so bad and America is turning in to North Mexico.

Dear Gov.
This is un-believable that the Government funded school board is being Bullied by a few people in the district. As Governor, Please Review the Percentage of people against the presentation of The President's Speech in our District, since The President of the United States was Elected in North Carolina, by The People. To give you the background of our concern, we received a letter from Our School Principal @ Union Primary in Shallotte, NC.
That Stated "Brunswick County Schools will not air President Obama's speech that is scheduled for Tuesday, Sept 8th. Instead, you can view the speech...and decide if you would like your child to see it at school on Friday". This via a signed Letter! Since when do we TEACH our Children that Dis-Respect for The Commander and Chief of our Nation is Proper. Should we then Teach our Children to Dis-Respect all Authority even Principals? Where are OUR PRINCIPALS THEN??? We Need Respect and Education all People have Laws and Rules in place for then to Opt out of Programs and/or Ideals that do not fit the Religious or Social Rights. These Should not be forced on the Majority. Below is the Email Forwarded that I sent to the School Board Prior to Receiving Such a Dis-Heartening Letter.

Dear Ms Babson,
It has come to my attention via a news story, that some school districts are debating  opting out of The President of the United States' speech on "The Importance of Education". If this is the case in Our County District, I would like for The Report of Public Records of Emails and/or call log counts of the number of requests to suspend. We all are concerned about furthering education and encouraging students that education will provide a more stable future for Our Country and Our Economy. Please accept my request to have my child, Ayden Royce Stanley, participate in The Presidential Education Address this next week, and not be made to feel that We as Nation are Divide. Please remember, as I learn school, the values we learn are the values we're taught. For without Government we would not have Public Schools. Let us press forward to Further Education and not Ignorance.


Thank you sincerely,

Bryan Clay Stanley

Subject: Taxicab Code of Ethic

Comment: August 21, 2009 I am sending this letter to everyone until I get to the right person> August 17, 2009 Listed Below is a copy of the letter I sent to Carolina Taxi on August 13th, I followed-up with a phone call. No one has gotten in touch with me, and like I said I am disable. I got in touch with the DOT in North Carolina, and they instructed me to get in touch with our local DMV. I am sending another copy of the letter to Carolina Taxi again. I have given them enough time, donâ€™t you think! I appreciate you taking the time to look into this matter. July 25, 2009 3107 Caralea Valley Drive Concord, NC 28027 Carolina Taxi 1705 S Cannon Blvd. Kannapolis, NC 28083 704-933-1700 Dear Mr: Jimenez: I had the displeasure of riding in one of your cabs on June 6th. This was my first time using your services. When we reached the Beauty Salon I couldnâ€™t find my money. So, I went inside to see if anyone in there had cash on them. They all had checks on them, so did I (I later found my money in my skirt pocket). Your dispatcher said it would be $22.00. In other words she charged me a fee for the return trip home, also. She also stated when I was inside the meter was still running. For which I was charged an additional fee of $4.00, because I went inside to ask for $11.00 to pay for the cabâ€™s fee and the wait time, also because the dispatcher said I couldnâ€™t get the number on my credit card right. In essence it was her, who could not the number on the my card right! I had my card in my hand and the number on card is exactly what I gave her. She said when one the cabs were in the area; they would bring my change back to me. That was on the 2nd of July. Your dispatcher also said they you all are the cheapest taxi in the area. I am a disable person and A&E waited on me plenty of times and never charged me.  There was a lady in the Beauty Salon when I got there.  She left and came back.  She told me that she came back just to take me home, because â€œshe said she didnâ€™t like thing with your credit cardâ€ (meaning being charged for a round trip which I had not plan to take).  I knew I had a way home. But, my request is this; because you charged me an extra $4.00 wait time do I get my money back for waiting on you? Now that was July 2nd and it is now July 25th (24 days).

Dear Elizabeth Townes Homeowners Association
P.O. Box 11906
Charlotte, North Carolina 28220 ( as according to your own letter for response )

    According to your letter sent to me dated August 28, 2009 you state "Although it is not necessary for you to contact anyone prior to the hearing in order to contest  the possible fine or suspension, ( which I am doing now by this email and letter of the same, allows me to not show up and send this letter instead) " in the event that you do want to communicate with someone, please forward a written response to Elizabeth Townes HOA at P.O Box 11906, Charlotte, NC  28220.  ........THEREFORE the reason for this formal official letter, copied to an agency over homeowners associations and emailed and sent to you this Saturday, September 5, 2009 for you to receive it before September 9, 2009, the date of my requested meeting with you asking for a postponement until the rightful owners, Mr. and Mrs. Bobby Brawley, return from vacation.  YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BEAT UP ON ME OR FINE ME UNTIL YOU HAVE READ THIS AS YOU SHOULD AND RESPOND IN KIND FROM HAWTHORNE MANAGEMENT AND NOT OUR ATTORNEY.  I refused delivery of some letter from Timothy Sellers, our attorney,  today, as I DO N NOT HAVE TO ACCEPT THIS, but should receive direct communication ethically from this board and Hawthorne Management FIRST.   This is a moral issue and then a legal one.  I am going to send this in letter form with priority mail so I can track delivery online.  This is also being copied to the association attorney on which some items I am somewhat prepared to take issue and send this written response as you say in your own words that I can do.    You have noticed me to a hearing on which I received Notice on August 29, 2009 for ONLY one week later on September 9, 2009, without considering any response from me or that I had previously set up a meeting with this board for MY CONCERNS, not yours for the same date. I have five minutes to speak.  I do not trust you to stick to my issues.  This board will change hands on October 20, 2009. So why meet with this board now who is going out ?  I had postponed my vacation plans, but in all due respect, I would much rather go to the beach or the mountains than spend one little minute with you all.   I am going to find some good people to run for office and you cannot do one thing about this, but try to counter it as with any election process to see to it that your power plays and corruption continue.  That is alright if you want to discuss the problems of "untimely" communication with this board to homeowners as to this meeting, i.e. or flower bed problems with me in this instance, to which you are harrassing me and picking on me for, which you know you are, and which is there is no problem, as you will see below, but not on MY TIME.  THAT IS NOT FAIR.  I am sure you would agree.   You must agree to be fair. 

    However since then I have just found today, September 4, 2009, whether you choose to believe this or not,  in a stack of medical bills I had not opened,  a previous letter from Hawthorne Management I had not opened until today, September 4, 2009, as I must have put this with my medical bills and not found it before now, some things, I am now prepared to take great issue with legally and morally with such violation of my rights as a homeowner to not be fined or for a hearing to even be held until you observe the following facts and as is written in your own letter to me dated August 4, 2009.  THE FOLLOWING MUST BE OBSERVED:   

    1)  A letter to give time to any homeowner to respond informing any homeowner of what they have done wrong, must be sent first before you can issue a hearing and possible fines.  I found this just today and even in this letter dated August 4, 2009, you state, "This was most likely a simple oversight."  referring to my front yard flower bed.  You can tell by my fury at my receiving your hearing notice dated August 28, 2009 and me not receiving this until the VERY day with evidence of postmark, an art event I had planned on August 29, 2009 of a white tent you want to fine me for now that I never put up, SO THIS IS MOOT, and I sent you proof in my email to Angie Baxter Faulk on August 28, at 4:46 PM BEFORE YOU SENT ME THIS HEARING NOTICE AND POSSIBLE FINE, in that I had to postpone my art event due to several factors one including the death of a friend of the artist.  Ms. Kelly Braxton who died with brain cancer, a week previous, the fact that we had major CEOs invited who responded they wanted to come, including our Governor, who responded to me, but had other plans as to state meetings, the Panther's game, vacations, 80th birthday parties, etc.  So Greg, the artist and I,  decided to postpone this art show with only ten percent responding they would come.  This is a good turn out, but I wanted more people present.  However,  I never should have received any letter asking for a hearing or possible fines on any of this.   I AM NOT GUILTY OF ANYTHING.  THIS IS EXACTLY LIKE YOU ARE HARRASSING ME.  IT IS.  It should be obvious to this board with  my subsequent emails and going in person to speak with members of the current board, i.e. LaDonna and Barbara, about these possible violations and fines, WHO BY ALL RIGHTS, any board member should be available, outside of Angie Baxter Faulk, at Hawthorne Management as you are the ones presiding over all our monies and there being NO LAW that says any board member does not HAVE TO  communicate with any homeowner, but in fact should, this ought tell you that I honestly did NOT receive or open any previous letter  from Hawthorne Management dated August 4, 2009, asking me to comply with some Article V, in that three sets of plans of any changes must be submitted to the board for approval,  to which I received it no sooner in the United States Mail, than  possibly August 6 or 7, 2009 by the postmark date of August 5, 2009.  Yet you gave me only one week  to uproot my front yard and return to my dead grass, as stated in this letter by August 14, 2009, I am sure which this board would be totally crazy to want, me to return to dead grass, as no grass will grow there and be unsightly, as I have taken comparison pictures now of my neighbors on either side of me, in this letter dated August 4, 2009 without even giving me a chance to send you my three sets of plans, and you even say in this letter in paragraph one, "This was most likely a simple oversight".  THIS IS NOT FAIR PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW IT.  Then be fair, and give me a chance like all the other homeowners out here with flowers and pavers in their front yards to submit my plans before holding any hearing.  I have now taken pictures of certain front yards, including our own Vice President, Barbara Gillis and others, and one homeowner whom I have spoken with who said they did not even remember sending you any plans whatsoever.  HELLO.  SO YOU ARE NOT BEING FAIR.  And I am not giving you their names in this letter so I can take just issue with several entities now in HARRASSEMENT AND DISCRIMINATION to  1)  Committee within the General Assembly 2) Planned Community Act 3) any Arbitration Group, 4) Attorney General, etc.   

    IN the August 28, 2009 notice to a hearing,  you state  I had violated some flower bed laws, according to Article V, ....."three copies of the plans and specification showing the nature, kind, shape, height, materials and location of the same shall have been submitted  to and approved in writing as to harmony of external design and location in relation to surrounding structures"  but on the second page you state

    * Beds cannot extend more than 3 feet out from the side of  home/structure - I AM NOT GUILTY OF THIS AS I HAVE AN INSIDE UNIT.  SO THIS IS MOOT.   

    * Beds must be located entirely on homeowners property.  THIS CHANGE IS EXACTLY ON MY PROPERTY NOT ENCROACHING ANY OTHER PROPERITES, COMMON AREAS OR EASEMENTS.  SO THIS IS MOOT.

    *  Homeowners may not plant flowerbeds in common area.  I HAVE NOT DONE THIS. SO THIS IS MOOT. 

     I am prepared to send you my three plans NOW as should be in order for this board to be fair and just and for the management company to be fair and for the association attorney to be fair.  Timothy Sellers is always saying "Consistency is what must be prevailing on any board."  So if I have evidence of now in many photographs of other homeowners with flowers and pavers out front and one who does not recall ever sending you plans,  as they said to me, "YOU ARE PICKING ON ME IN A DISCRIMINATORY FASHION" AND TAKING ISSUE WITH SOMETHING THAT LONG EXISTED IN MY FRONT YARD AT LEAST FOR ONE MONTH AND ONE WEEK PREVIOUS AND ONLY TOOK ISSUE "AFTER" I SENT OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT, MS. LADONNA WALDEN NOTICE THAT I WAS TAKING OUR ASSOCIATION ATTORNEY TO THE STATE BAR ETHIC'S COMMITTEE.  HELLO.  YOU STATE IN THIS LETTER DATED AUGUST 28, 2009 THAT IF I DO NOT COMPLY, OR COME TO THIS MEETING YOU MAY STRIP ME OF MY VOTING RIGHTS BECAUSE YOU KNOW A FUTURE BOARD IS ABOUT TO BE ELECTED AND IF I AM ELECTED TO SERVE ON THE FORTHCOMING BOARD, I WILL FIRE TIMOTHY SELLERS.  YOU WILL NOT VIOLATE MY VOTING RIGHTS.  YOU HAVE ABUSED ME FOR YOUR OWN SELFISH MONETARY GAIN AND POWER STRUGGLES WITHOUT GIVING ME A FAIR CHANCE AND YOU STATE IN AN OUTRIGHT LETTER THAT YOU WILL FINE ME $100.00 IF I DO NOT COME TO THIS HEARING, AND POSSIBLY $100.00 A DAY, AFTERWARDS, although you are not giving me a fair chance to do as others who have flowers and pavers in their front yard, including our Vice President, Ms. Barbara Gillis and many others, to submit my plans FIRST, SO YOU SHOULD NOT charge me $100.00 FOR THIS AND THEN $100.00 A DAY AFTER THIS IF I DO NOT COMPLY ALTHOUGH THIS BOARD IS GUILTY OF NOT GIVING ME TIME, AS TO 30 DAYS BY LAW ON MOST OTHER LEGAL ISSUES, TO RESPOND.  OH NO.  AND I LIVE ON DISABLITY OF ONLY $981.00 A MONTH. HOW DARE YOU ?????? YOU HAVE GIVEN ME ONE WEEK TO TEAR MY YARD UP, LEAVING WHAT?...... WITH NO POSSIBLE CHANCE TO SUBMIT MY THREE SETS OF PLANS AND THEN AFTER THIS LETTER DATED AUGUST 4, 2009, YOU SENT ME A NOTICE FOR HEARING NOT 30 DAYS OUT, BUT, (29 SUBTRACT 7), DATES OF RECEIPT,) WHICH LEAVES THREE WEEKS AFTER AS TO NOTICE FOR POSSIBLE FINES AND A HEARING.  NO.  DO YOU HEAR ME?  NO.  I AM SURE THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY WILL LOVE THIS ONE.  AND THIS BOARD OF 2009 BEING TOTALLY GUILTY OF NEGLIGENCE IN NOT PUTTING UP MONTHLY MINUTES AND FINANCIALS ONLINE OR EVEN HAVING MEETINGS FOR MINUTES FOR FOUR LONG MONTHS, MAY, JUNE, JULY AND AUGUST, 2009  AND NOT MADE AVAILABLE TO THE HOMEOWNERS NOR THE 2008 AUDIT WHICH TOOK ME TWO MONTHS TO OBTAIN FROM ANGIE BAXTER FAULK.  Also, you know as well as I do that I have sent copies of affidavits against past President Cindy Belles and Vice President Mary Lennert of the 2005 board to our current President, Ms. LaDonna Walden.  Mary Lennert now serves on the current board 2009.  HELLO.  It is not hard to determine who is causing all these problems. 

    Here is what I suggest.  You re-think all this.  But I am NOT coming to any noticed hearing on September 9, 2009.  I WILL SEND YOU PICTURES AND MY PLANS AS IS MY RIGHT TO DO SO FIRST.  AND PICTURES OF OTHER HOMEOWNERS OUT HERE WITH SOMETHING SIMILAR.  And if you have the utter immoral inconsideration or gall to fine me or keep me from my voting rights when all other homeowners out here have flowers and pavers in their front yards, I will have NO PROBLEM getting a class action lawsuit formed against you as the 2009 board, EXCEPT MS. GINGER HALL AND SAMANTHA CORNING BIGGIN, WHO ARE MOST UPRIGHT MORAL FAIR PEOPLE,  and against our association attorney, Mr. Timothy Sellers,  and for this sudden raise in homeowners dues up to seven percent per annum against our legal raise of only 5 percent written in our By Laws and CCRs and fines of $100.00 a pop to others out here as to crippled homeowners who cannot get their trash cans in on time without help, crazy fines to some homeowners of another $100.00 that I have spoken with, inconsistent parking violation procedures, threats to tow illegally, etc. etc.

    YOU WANT HELL.  YOU HAVE GOT IT AND YOU ARE GOING TO LIVE IT UNLESS YOU CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDES.   THIS IS NOT A NAZI NAPOLEANONIC POLICE STATE OUT HERE.  YOU CANNOT AND WILL NOT ABUSE ANY HOMEOWNERS WHO PAY YOU OUR MONEY, FOR THEIR JUST RIGHTS TO BE RESPECTED AND TO RESPOND TO ON TIME AND GIVE PROPER TIME TO RESPOND, AND BE TREATED AS YOU YOURSELVES WANT TO BE TREATED. Would it not be nice if you were just nice and worked with me and other homeowners out here as you would want to be treated and got response and communication ON TIME as to minutes and financials to see how our monies are being used as should happen.  You cannot be SO VERY GUILTY YOURSELVES and then find issue with one flick in my eye as to my red begonias as it says in the very Bible, "DO NOT FIND A SPECK OF WRONG IN SOMEONE ELSE'S EYE WHEN YOU HAVE A HUGE BLOCK OF SIN IN YOUR OWN EYES."  And I am not even guilty.  I will show any judge, if it comes to this, the dead grass on either side of me as to my neighbors, the pavers and flowers in other yards, that you have allowed, including your own yards, and that you want me to uproot this beauty in my front yard with a one week notice without giving me the same rights as to sending you my plans, as according to Article V, and that you want me to return to the dessert front yard I had originally.  OH THAT WILL GO OVER WELL WITH SOME JUDGE OR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR OUR GOVENOR.  IT WILL  NOT GO  GOOD AT ALL. I REFUSE TO LET MY YARD LOOK BADLY FOR YOU.  I LIKE A CLEAN CLASSY LOOK. 

    MY PARENTS, MR. AND MRS. BOBBY BRAWLEY WILL RETURN FROM HILTON HEAD ISLAND ON OR AROUND SEPTEMBER 13, 2009.  I HAVE ASKED JOE AIKEN, PRESIDENT OF HAWTHORNE MANAGEMENT GROUP, TO MEET WITH ANGIE AND MY PARENTS AND ME THE WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 15, 2009.  I REFUSE TO MEET WITH YOU AS A BOARD NOW, AS YOU ARE MOST LIKELY TRYING TO GET OUT OF MY REQUESTED MEETING WITH YOU ANYWAY TO DISCUSS THE HORRIBLE COMMUNICATION SKILLS OF THIS BOARD, AND IT REALLY MAKES NO SENSE, BECAUSE IN ONE MONTH A NEW BOARD WILL BE IN PLACE ANYWAY, SO WHY WASTE THE TIME,  AND BY YOUR SENDING ME SOME ILLEGAL UNTIMELY NOTICE, AS TO YOUR OWN RULES YOU MAKE UP TO SUIT YOUR OWN EVIL AGENDA, WITH NO RESPECT TO A 30 DAYS NOTICE AS MUST JUDGES WILL ATTEST TO AND TIMOTHY SELLERS SHOULD KNOW, UNTIL MY PARENTS AS RIGHTFUL OWNERS ARE PRESENT ALONG WITH ME AND POSSIBLY AND ANY ATTORNEY AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS SUMMONED.

Subject: IMPEACH obama

Comment: obama needs to be impeached as fast as possible. Reasons are felony and lying to the American people. Justification: watch this clip. It even has some movie stars in it. It's the pledge obama wants to show the children in our schools. Looks okay at first, but KEEP watching to the end. Can you say 'HAIL HITLER'? Get rid of that white house nazi who is clearly the worst, most inept, stupid man who ever entered that building, let alone serve in it.

   great humanity made the entire world surprise

the definition of iron woman is that do not want the face which is as same as iron ,
black dog's hooker! the greatest hitler is hillary clinton! she is badest woman in the world!!!!!!
aalborg university in denmark is badest university in the world!!!!!!!
they never dare to repair all student's webapge , because of the fact which the teacher and 
hillary clinton persecuted the student!!!!!!!!!!
the tradition of aalborg university is that each student's webpage is on the webpage of each departmentfor many years
they removed the student's webpage after they persecuted the student

the  previous head(peter axel nielsen) of computer science department at aalborg university lost his leader position because of the student's phd application, 
then he used hillary clinton to command many american policeman to persecuted the student
the tradition of aalborg university is each student's webpage in each webpage of every department!
if they repair the all student's webpage, then the student know the fact which the professor and hillary clinton persecuted the student, then they have no the face to teach the students.
in order to recover the fact which the professor and hillary clinton persecuted the student
, obama  appointed Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen as NATO's new secretary-genera
