I hope you find the time to read this with an open mind. It's interesting.  Please read it with the open mind rather than immediately breaking it down into left or right, but rather look at it from the neutral viewpoint of right or wrong.  It's like the line below says, "what if he is right?"



Take the three minutes to read this.
Maybe he is wrong.
What if he is right?



David Kaiser is a respected historian whose published works have covered a broad range of topics, from European Warfare to American League Baseball. Born in 1947, the son of a diplomat, Kaiser spent his childhood in three capital cities: Washington D.C. , Albany , New York , and Dakar , Senegal .. He attended Harvard University , graduating there in 1969 with a B.A. In history. He then spent several years more at Harvard, gaining a PhD in history, which he obtained in 1976. He served in the Army Reserve from 1970 to 1976.

He is a professor in the Strategy and Policy Department of the United States Naval War College . He has previously taught at Carnegie Mellon, Williams College and Harvard University . Kaiser's latest book, The Road to Dallas, about the Kennedy assassination, was just published by Harvard University Press.


Dr. David Kaiser


History Unfolding

I am a student of history. Professionally, I have written 15 books on history that have been published in six languages, and I have studied history all my life. I have come to think there is something monumentally large afoot, and I do not believe it is simply a banking crisis, or a mortgage crisis, or a credit crisis. Yes these exist, but they are merely single facets on a very large gemstone that is only now coming into a sharper focus.

Something of historic proportions is happening. I can sense it because I know how it feels, smells, what it looks like, and how people react to it. Yes, a perfect storm may be brewing, but there is something happening within our country that has been evolving for about ten to fifteen years. The pace has dramatically quickened in the past two.

We demand and then codify into law the requirement that our banks make massive loans to people we know they can never pay back? Why?

We learned just days ago that the Federal Reserve, which has little or no real oversight by anyone, has "loaned" two trillion dollars (that is $2,000,000,000,000) over the past few months, but will not tell us to whom or why or disclose the terms. That is our money. Yours and mine. And that is three times the $700 billion we all argued about so strenuously just this past September. Who has this money? Why do they have it? Why are the terms unavailable to us? Who asked for it? Who authorized it? I thought this was a government of "we the people," who loaned our powers to our elected leaders. Apparently not.

We have spent two or more decades intentionally de-industrializing our economy.. Why?

We have intentionally dumbed down our schools, ignored our history, and no longer teach our founding documents, why we are exceptional, and why we are worth preserving. Students by and large cannot write, think critically, read, or articulate. Parents are not revolting, teachers are not picketing, school boards continue to back mediocrity. Why?

We have now established the precedent of protesting every close election (violently in California over a proposition that is so controversial that it simply wants marriage to remain defined as between one man and one woman. Did you ever think such a thing possible just a decade ago?) We have corrupted our sacred political process by allowing unelected judges to write laws that radically change our way of life, and then mainstream Marxist groups like ACORN and others to turn our voting system into a banana republic. To what purpose?

Now our mortgage industry is collapsing, housing prices are in free fall, major industries are failing, our banking system is on the verge of collapse, social security is nearly bankrupt, as is Medicare and our entire government. Our education system is worse than a joke (I teach college and I know precisely what I am talking about) - the list is staggering in its length, breadth, and depth.. It is potentially 1929 x  ten...And we are at war with an enemy we cannot even name for fear of offending people of the same religion, who, in turn, cannot wait to slit the throats of your children if they have the opportunity to do so.

And finally, we have elected a man that no one really knows anything about, who has never run so much as a Dairy Queen, let alone a town as big as Wasilla , Alaska .. All of his associations and alliances are with real radicals in their chosen fields of employment, and everything we learn about him, drip by drip, is unsettling if not downright scary (Surely you have heard him speak about his idea to create and fund a mandatory civilian defense force stronger than our military for use inside our borders? No? Oh, of course. The media would never play that for you over and over and then demand he answer it. Sarah Palin's pregnant daughter and $150,000 wardrobe are more important.)

Mr. Obama's winning platform can be boiled down to one word: Change. Why?

I have never been so afraid for my country and for my children as I am now.

This man campaigned on bringing people together, something he has never, ever done in his professional life. In my assessment, Obama will divide us along philosophical lines, push us apart, and then try to realign the pieces into a new and different power structure. Change is indeed coming. And when it comes, you will never see the same nation again.

And that is only the beginning..

As a serious student of history, I thought I would never come to experience what the ordinary, moral German must have felt in the mid-1930s In those times, the "savior" was a former smooth-talking rabble-rouser from the streets, about whom the average German knew next to nothing. What they should have known was that he was associated with groups that shouted, shoved, and pushed around people with whom they disagreed; he edged his way onto the political stage through great oratory. Conservative "losers" read it right now.

And there were the promises. Economic times were tough, people were losing jobs, and he was a great speaker. And he smiled and frowned and waved a lot. And people, even newspapers, were afraid to speak out for fear that his "brown shirts" would bully and beat them into submission. Which they did - regularly. And then, he was duly elected to office, while a full-throttled economic crisis bloomed at hand - the Great Depression. Slowly, but surely he seized the controls of government power, person by person, department by department, bureaucracy by bureaucracy. The children of German citizens were at first, encouraged to join a Youth Movement in his name where they were taught exactly what to think. Later, they were required to do so. No Jews of course,  

How did he get people on his side? He did it by promising jobs to the jobless, money to the money-less, and rewards for the military-industrial complex. He did it by indoctrinating the children, advocating gun control, health care for all, better wages, better jobs, and promising to re-instill pride once again in the country, across Europe , and across the world. He did it with a compliant media - did you know that? And he did this all in the name of justice and .... . .. change. And the people surely got what they voted for.

If you think I am exaggerating, look it up. It's all there in the history books.

So read your history books. Many people of conscience objected in 1933 and were shouted down, called names, laughed at, and ridiculed. When Winston Churchill pointed out the obvious in the late 1930s while seated in the House of Lords in England (he was not yet Prime Minister), he was booed into his seat and called a crazy troublemaker. He was right, though. And the world came to regret that he was not listened to.

Do not forget that Germany was the most educated, the most cultured country in Europe . It was full of music, art, museums, hospitals, laboratories, and universities. And yet, in less than six years (a shorter time span than just two terms of the U. S. presidency) it was rounding up its own citizens, killing others, abrogating its laws, turning children against parents, and neighbors against neighbors.. All with the best of intentions, of course. The road to Hell is paved with them.

As a practical thinker, one not overly prone to emotional decisions, I have a choice: I can either believe what the objective pieces of evidence tell me (even if they make me cringe with disgust); I can believe what history is shouting to me from across the chasm of seven decades; or I can hope I am wrong by closing my eyes, having another latte, and ignoring what is transpiring around me..

I choose to believe the evidence. No doubt some people will scoff at me, others laugh, or think I am foolish, naive, or both. To some degree, perhaps I am. But I have never been afraid to look people in the eye and tell them exactly what I believe-and why I believe it.

I pray I am wrong. I do not think I am. Perhaps the only hope is our vote in the next elections.

Pass this along. Perhaps it will help to begin the awakening of America as to where we are headed.......

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am very angry about the recent revelations concerning ACORN. ACORN's actions are truly evil. Their serial assistance of child prostitution is inexcusable and unconscionable. ACORN must be defunded immediately. Any organization abetting child sexual slavery must be shut down immediately. Their assets must be frozen and a real investigation of this heinous criminal organization must begin now. The use of every law enforcement resource is paramount. A total revelation of their actions both current and in the past must be brought into the light of day. ACORN must be banned from providing assistance with the census. This corrupt organization must not be allowed to participate during the census. It is very apparent that ACORN is a threat to the citizens of the US. ACORN's continued existence is an affront to all that is moral and good. I am shocked and appalled that millions and potentially billions of dollars are being provided to this organization. Acorn must not receive one more tax dollar - ever! An Very Angry Citizen, Anthony Lewis 5006 Jane Ave Charlotte, North Carolina 28269

9/11 - National Day of Service and Remembrance

Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance and the culmination of the “United We Serve” campaign.  Governor Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet Secretaries, Governor’s Office staff, state government employees and citizens across North Carolina have participated in this campaign to serve others.
Volunteering always is important, but this especially rings true in these tough economic times when so many need so much help.  
On Thursday, Gov. Perdue helped launch “Books on Bases, Smiles on Faces,” a literacy program for military children by Blue Star Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).   She spoke to military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read “Home is Where the Army Sends You” by local author Melissa Davis.  She also helped distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high population of military children.
The Governor also announced that N.C. AmeriCorps members and N.C. National Guard armories have united in a service project to honor military families.  The theme was “Little Heroes Family Connection.” AmeriCorps program members gathered across the state to collect items and assemble packages to help children create a message for deployed parents or family members.
“Through this United We Serve project, North Carolina’s AmeriCorps members and National Guard have shown that it only takes a small effort to give something back to their communities,” Perdue said. “By serving — we honor those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we build strong families and strong communities all over North Carolina.”
Today, Governor Perdue planted collard greens and cabbages at the Executive Mansion as part of the “Plant a Row for the Hungry” campaign.  Plant a Row (PAR) is a national campaign to encourage all gardeners to grow a little extra produce to donate to the hungry and homeless.  The Raleigh PAR campaign collects produce to donate to the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle.
Gov. Perdue Vetoes Bill That Would Limit Access to Public Records

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday vetoed House Bill 104, “An Act To Clarify Legislative Confidentiality.”
“Transparency and accountability are hallmarks of my administration.  If this legislation became law, documents that are currently public record would become private,” said Perdue.  “Additionally, this bill treats certain state employees unequally.”
The General Assembly passed the legislation on August 10 after making significant changes during the last days of legislative session.
Pursuant to the Constitution, the Governor must call a special session no later than September 20 unless a majority of each house signs a written document stating that there is no need for the session to be convened.
Gov. Perdue Calls for Focus on Prevention as Flu Season Arrives

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday called on North Carolina residents to re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of the school year and the arrival of flu season.
“Parents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,” Perdue said.  “I don’t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.”
Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line of prevention;
- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
- If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
- Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
- If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.
- Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.

Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.
“When a home is foreclosed — it’s bad for our families, it’s bad for our communities, it’s bad for our businesses and it’s bad for North Carolina,” said Perdue.  “This bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.”
Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.
SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.
Consumer tips on home loans, debt collectors and many other topics are available from the Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division at <http://www.ncdoj.gov/>www.ncdoj.gov.
Furniture Maker Brings New Plant, 128 Jobs to Alexander County

Caye Home Furnishings, an international manufacturer of custom home furniture, will open a new plant in Taylorsville.  The company plans to invest $1.4 million and create 128 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
“North Carolina, known worldwide for producing fine furniture, continues to be a leading player in this vital manufacturing sector,” Perdue said.  “Our state’s skilled workforce and superb quality of life continue to attract growing companies like Caye Home Furnishings.”
Caye Home Furnishings LLC, headquartered in Mississippi, manufactures living room furniture and case goods including products marketed under the Stratford and Stratolounger name brands.  The company has five manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, Florida, two in China and one in Star, N.C., which opened in August 2008 and employs 52 workers.  The new Taylorsville plant will assemble furniture products to serve that growing market.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $30,142, not including benefits, which is higher than Alexander County’s average annual wage of $27,300.

Gov. Perdue Announces the Blue Ridge Parkway to be Honored in U.S. Mint Program

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday announced that the Blue Ridge Parkway will be honored in the new U.S. Mint America the Beautiful Quarters program.  Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner approved the list of sites recommended by the U.S. Mint on Aug. 25, 2009, after consultation with Governor Perdue and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar.

“Countless visitors from around the world have lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway – one of America’s great treasures,” said Perdue. “Now the lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway and its majestic legacy will be captured on these special coins.”
The United States Mint’s America the Beautiful Quarters Program is a 12-year initiative authorized by the America’s Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008.  The act directs the United States Mint to strike and issue 56 circulating quarters with tails side designs emblematic of a national park or other national site in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories — Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands.
The quarters will be issued sequentially each year, in the order in which the featured site was first established as a national park or site.  The coins’ heads side will feature the familiar “restored” 1932 portrait of George Washington, including subtle details and the beauty of the original model.
To view the complete National Site Registry, which lists all 56 sites to be honored under the U.S. Mint’s America the Beautiful Quarters Program in chronological order by year, please visit <http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/NSQuartersProgram/?action=siteRegister>www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/NSQuartersProgram/?action=siteRegister.

Following is the question just received:
Visitor: Mrs. Lana Gentile

Address: 565 Bartlett Hollow Rd, Old Fort, NC 28762

Email: lggentile@peoplepc.com

Subject: Many Unanswered Questions...

Comment: Lana Gentile 565 Bartlett Hollow Road Old Fort, NC 28762-5783 September 12, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Governor Perdue: I have many questions that I need some honest answers to. I expect and deserve to get these answers from Congress. The current administration is increasing its power base daily and this power needs to shift back to the People and the State according to our Constitution. I don't want the government to control my life - it denies me my Constitutional rights. I want my elected officials to respond to the People's needs, my needs, not the Administration's desire to change our country to a socialist nation or worse and this is where I believe this Obama "change " is really taking us. My questions: 1-Why do we need a Civilian Force as requested by President Obama? This is just another way to increase the size of government and its power over the People. It smacks of the days of Nazi Germany as do so many of his other demands. 2-Why is President Obama surrounding himself with avowed communists and admitted radicals? This is not what our once great country was founded upon and we are very quickly losing all we once proudly stood for and were a shining example to the rest of the world for. 3-Do the Czars have actual power? How much are they paid and by whom? Who do they answer to besides the President? How much power do they actually have? Why can't they be run through a Senate confirmation and then we would be able to contact them with our questions? Then they could be held responsible to Congress and the People for their actions. I have taken the trouble to find out some things about them and I don't like what I see. I don't want these people advising the President of the United States no matter who he is. 4-Why won't members of Congress read the bills before they vote on them? if they really did their jobs and represented the people who elected them, perhaps they would deserve the position that they have. We, the People, have jobs and bosses that we have to be responsible to or we lose our jobs. Maybe they should keep in mind that they, too, can lose theirs. 5-Who are the people in the Apollo Alliance? How many of them are radicals? What do they do exactly? Why are they writing bills and policies? Nobody ever asks me my opinion and needs - shouldn't they be asking us? 6-Why a "voluntary" youth core? Isn't this very similar yet again to Nazi Germany and the Hitler Youth? 7-Why was a bill passed enabling the government to seize and shut down private sector computers under the guise of National Security and why do they require companies to "share" information? Why can they disconnect our computers from the Internet for periodic mapping? Just today, a few hours ago, I have written letters and Blogs and suddenly I find that I am unable to connect to the Internet because I have no dial tone. There is no obvious reason for this, no storm, no power outage, nothing unplugged or disconnected, no faulty wiring. I just have dead air. I now suspect that mine, too, will be shut down and searched after I ask my questions or write my Blogs and if I find out that this is what is happening, there will be many more questions and many more Blogs. I will not be silenced. I will find a computer somewhere, as many as I need to find, and when that is exhausted I will write letters until the Postal Service will no longer deliver them. Never in my life have I felt the invasion of my privacy and the loss of my Rights so profoundly. This is not the way it's supposed to be. In studies of the Bible and Religions, I learned that the number "7" means complete, or finished. My instructors inevitably made 7 points in lectures or gave out 7 handouts and I have found myself often doing the same thing without really thinking about it - I paint 7 pictures in a series, I read 7 books in a series by an author, I purchase 7 items, or have 7 items on a grocery list. I thought I was finished with my 7 questions and demands but, as I watch the day unfold, there is still much unfinished business. I am forced to end with two more questions. 8-In light of the last 2 days events that the liberal media is not reporting, I must address the ACORN issues. It is bad enough that, unknowingly, the taxpayer has given $57 million over the past few years to this organization. Today, we know that another $8.5 BILLION has been earmarked for ACORN in the President's stimulus package. But now we are beginning to learn what some of our hard-earned money is going for: CORRUPTION of the worst kind. Tax evasion and fraud, buying brothels disguised as a "home" for a prostitute (now legally coded as a "performance artist"), giving legal tax codes for prostitution, how to claim tax write-offs for business (condoms), importing under-age illegal girls from another country for a sex ring, and giving instructions on how to claim them as "dependants". And this is only two branches of their offices, one in Baltimore MD and one in Washington DC! Of course, at first, the reporting was labeled as Right Wing Gotcha reporting and defamation BUT the workers were then immediately fired as a few bad apples. Who knows what else is being sanctioned in how many offices in our country by this community organizer group? I say NO MORE. No more taxpayer $ goes to fund ACORN from this moment on. I found it unconscionable that these workers did not question the illegality of what they were doing and furthermore incredible that they fell for the same identical people and situation twice in as many days. And I am asking you: Will you push for a complete Congressional investigation of the ACORN Organization? 9-Entirely appropriate, as this is 9/11- Will you push for an investigation of the John Adams project? It is way past time that our President and his administration stand up for and protect our intelligence systems. Eight years ago, I sat at my breakfast table, preparing to go to work, just as the horror began. I thought, how can this be happening? How can this be real? Is this some kind of macabre joke? As the second plane lunged toward the Towers, I called my boss and said, "I'm gonna be late." He, in turn said, "Don't come in. We are all going home today. Who knows what kind of nuts will come out of the woodwork now and perpetrate further crimes against innocent people? Stay home and be safe." I worked for a Religious Institution, one that still was shaken by atrocities perpetrated against a people some 40 years before; a people who vowed "never to forget". One that saw increased police protection whenever there was a Religious Holiday with special services that inevidently brought out the worst in our safe, small, Southern community. As the events progressed, I found myself singing along with Congress, united for once, on the steps of the Capital building, tears running down my face for the innocent lives lost, and a cold hard fear that maybe I wasn't as safe and free as I thought. I sat enamored and amazed as my President fearlessly returned to the site and dealt with what must have been a totally unthinkable crisis for a new President to handle. But handle it he did and we, as a country, have been safe for the last 8 years thanks to his bravery and actions. I don't care what he has done right or wrong; this one thing makes him a hero in my book. I cried, for a long time after, every time I heard Alan Jackson sing "Where Were You When The World Stopped Turning?" I still do. I sang at a hockey game the Sunday after 9/11, but not the Star Spangled Banner as requested by the owners of the franchise. I insisted on performing Lee Greenwood's "I'm Proud To Be An American," a capella, with a lead-in of the words of George Bush - "We shall Not Tire, We Shall Not Falter, We Shall Not Fail." It was the most relevant and inspiring thing that I ever felt compelled to do and the crowd was on its feet, singing more loudly than ever, knowing every word. We all had tears flowing that night, we all were grieving, we all were one. And I thought, "we will never forget." Have we become complacent in our safety over the last 8 years? I think, perhaps, some of us have forgotten and it greatly pains me. And I feel that now the "nuts have come out of the woodwork" again, only this time they are creeping into the White House. This administration seems bent on apologizing, ignoring terrorism as if it never existed and does not still present a clear and present danger, and is thwarting all of our efforts at continuing our country's safety. Will you please push for increased defense spending, more troops as needed in these precarious countries who would do us harm of unimaginable horrors, throw out the PC jargon and call it what it is, and let our intelligence services do what they must to keep us safe? I hope, that as an elected official, you will be asking these questions too, because it is time for you to wake up and smell the stench that is currently prevailing in this country. It is time for We, the People, and you are supposed to be one of us, to take back control of our country, our Constitution, and our Rights. Become informed and ask the questions that so badly need answers. And if you don't like the answers you get, write the bills that will remove these people from power who are abusing their office and our Constitutional Rights. Stand up for your good name and for your constituents. Sincerely, Lana Gentile 8286684207 Lana Gentile sent this message via Congress.org, which uses the Capwizï¿½XC system.

> TurboCare Announces $30M Expansion in Rural Hall

TurboCare Inc., a subsidiary of Siemens Energy that provides turbomachinery parts and services to companies around the world, will expand its Forsyth County facility, creating 110 jobs and investing $30 million during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $220,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

> “TurboCare’s expansion is a win for Rural Hall and for North Carolina,” Perdue said. “That so many international companies doing business in North Carolina choose to expand here when they have options around the country and around the world shows that our commitments to education, training and a business-friendly environment continue to prove successful.”

> TurboCare offers service solutions in the industrial and power generation markets in more than 100 countries. It provides a complete range of component repair, equipment refurbishment, system retrofits, engineering and parts replacement services with 2,500 workers worldwide. That includes 176 current employees in Rural Hall.

> Salaries for the 110 new workers will vary by job function, but the overall average wage will be $45,855 a year, not including benefits. That is higher than the Forsyth County average annual wage of $39,936 without benefits.

> Gov. Perdue Announces the Blue Ridge Parkway to be Honored in U.S. Mint Program

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday announced that the Blue Ridge Parkway will be honored in the new U.S. Mint America the Beautiful Quarters program. Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner approved the list of sites recommended by the U.S. Mint on Aug. 25, 2009, after consultation with Governor Perdue and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar.
> 
> “Countless visitors from around the world have lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway – one of America’s great treasures,” said Perdue. “Now the lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway and its majestic legacy will be captured on these special coins.”

> The United States Mint’s America the Beautiful Quarters Program is a 12-year initiative authorized by the America’s Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008.  The act directs the United States Mint to strike and issue 56 circulating quarters with tails side designs emblematic of a national park or other national site in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories — Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands.

> The quarters will be issued sequentially each year, in the order in which the featured site was first established as a national park or site.  The coins’ heads side will feature the familiar “restored” 1932 portrait of George Washington, including subtle details and the beauty of the original model.

This is not an isolated incident, and as a tax paying citizen I demand that ACORN be investigated and shut down. This is despicable and cause for grave concern.

Census Severs Relationship With ACORN

September 11, 2009 7:02 PM

The Census Bureau late this afternoon “severed” its relationship with the non-profit housing and grassroots community organizing group ACORN for the 2010 Census.

ACORN – the <http://www.acorn.org/>Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now – bills itself as “the nation's largest community organization of low and moderate income families.”

Census Bureau spokesman Stephen Buckner said officials in the bureau, which is part of the Department of Commerce, had been concerned with news reports about ACORN for awhile and “had been monitoring them.”

Buckner said recent videotapes posted on <http://biggovernment.com/>BigGovernment.com and broadcast on Fox News -- showing a young man and young woman pretending to be a pimp and prostitute, declaring themselves such and apparently able to secure the help of ACORN employees in <http://biggovernment.com/2009/09/11/washington-dc-acorn-video-child-prostitution-investigation/>Washington D.C. , and <http://biggovernment.com/2009/09/10/chaos-for-glory/>Baltimore, in obtaining housing – was “the tipping point.”

It was “cumulative,” Buckner said, “but certainly the recent activity didn’t help.”

<http://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/AcornSigned91109.pdf>In a letter to ACORN President Maude Hurd, Census Bureau director Robert Groves wrote that, while “not decisive factors in this decision, recent events concerning several local offices of ACORN have added to the worsening negative perceptions of ACORN and its affiliation with our partnership efforts.”

Groves wrote that the Census Bureau no longer has “confidence that our national partnership agreement is being effectively managed” through ACORN’s many local offices.

“Their affiliation caused sufficient concern with the general public,” said Buckner, so that ACORN outreach on behalf of the Census would be “a distraction from our mission, and would maybe even be a discouragement” for participation.

ACORN  encouraged some minority and poor populations to participate in the Census, Buckner said, telling them it was “important to participate in and safe to participate in.”

There’s a “correlation” between those who are poor and those “mistrustful of government,” he said. But he said the Census Bureau officials are confident they can reach those populations with their 80,000 other partners.

In a written statement, Alton Bennett, the president of ACORN housing, and Mike Shea, the executive director, said they "were appalled and angry to see the video of two Washington, D.C. employees offering advice on how to operate an illegal enterprise to keep it hidden from the government. While no transaction took place – no loan documents were signed or submitted, no bank loans were arranged, no new business was established – this is not how we behave. All ACORN Housing staff members undergo rigorous training and are expected to comply with high standards for ethical behavior and compliance with the law."

But that said, Bennett and Shea say the BigGovernment.com "video tape is slanted to misinform the public about ACORN Housing. The people who made this tape went to at least five other ACORN Housing offices where they were turned away or where ACORN Housing employees responded by calling the police. That is not mentioned on the tape – it is part of a long-term plan to smear ACORN Housing for political reasons and provide entertainment in the process. But that does not excuse the behavior of the employees. We have fired them and are initiating an internal review of practices and reminding all staff of their obligation to uphold the highest legal and ethical standards."

Rep. Charles Boustany, Jr., of Louisiana, the ranking Republican on the Oversight Subcommittee for the House Ways and Means Committee, called for a subcommittee hearing to "investigate ACORN’s activities in providing tax advice and tax preparation services, as well as whether ACORN has conducted activities inconsistent with the requirements for retaining tax-exempt status."

Subject: Support Sensible Poker Legislation

Comment: Joe Brown 1061 Acorn Dr. Purlear, NC 28665-9090 September 14, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: As a constituent, voter, and proud poker player, I am writing to ask for your support regarding specific actions our great state will be required to take if legislation in the U.S. Congress becomes law. Specifically, two bills to license, regulate, and tax online games of skill like poker have been introduced in the Congress. If either passes into law, our state will have to make a choice. EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE FEDERAL BILLS, THE FINAL DECISION WILL BE MADE BY EACH INDIVIDUAL STATE. We can either participate in the program or opt out of the provisions of the bill. I ask that you support keeping our state in this important program. U.S. House Bill H.R. 2267 and U.S. Senate Bill S. 1597 provide for sensible licensing, regulation, and taxation of Internet poker. They mandate rigorous, verifiable safeguards against underage participation while providing consumer protections for the millions, including many in our state, who play online poker every day. These bills also include dedicated funding to establish and implement programs for prevention and treatment of those with excessive gaming habits. Both bills benefit our state economically. According to an economic study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers in April, tax revenues from these bills will provide billions of dollars to the U.S. Treasury and to the states in the program. Additionally, the Senate bill provides for revenue-sharing with participating states, bringing even more much-needed funds into our state's coffers. Both bills allow American companies to participate in the world's Internet poker market, bringing needed jobs to our state as well. Solutions like H.R. 2267 and S. 1597 provide the most rational approach to controlling this industry and preserving it for adults who choose to engage in games of skill like poker. An unenforceable, unpopular prohibition provides none of these benefits. All prohibition can do is drive players underground or overseas while limiting my personal freedom. What's most important to me is your support for my rights. Please respond to this letter and let me know if you will support keeping our state in this important program. I hope that I, along with my over one million fellow Poker Players Alliance members can count on your support. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Joe Brown 3369730538

Subject: Medical Reform and other out of control spending

Comment: First I would like to say that I wasn't born or raised in North Carolina, I chose to move here to eventually retire and had planned to try to start a business that involved helping others but as the state governing bodies and the irresponsible greed and corruption of our Federal government continues to grow in both parties I cannot follow this lifelong dream of mine at this time. Having said that, I would like to respectfully request that you take a real leadership position for the citizens of our state by demanding real changes that will make a difference for North Carolina's financial problems such as bills that include caps on the frivolous law suits allowed against doctors, nurses, and hospitals so that they do not go beyond financial reimbursement and get our state laws changed that restrict the purchasing of health care insurance across state lines that would truly increase competition. Push to stop our illegal alien problem and stop these law breakers who drain our state of it's resources. Instead of getting in bed with the corrupt federal gov't machine of special interests, the unions and yes Acorn I would rather see you push our State Attorney General to reset the scales of justice and push for a thorough investigation of all Acorn offices and affiliates within the state of North Carolina. The scriptures tell us we are to work with our hands and be dependent on no one and I am most sure that means gov't. My constant prayer to God is that you will do the right thing instead of what seems to be most popular with whoever it is that is advising you. I challenge you to hear the voices of those of us who marched on DC on 9/12 representing our state and put liberty, justice, and the constitution before the agenda of the progressive Democrat party that will lead to tyranny and the destruction of our republic as our founding fathers intended it to be. Google got all kinds of special incentives (they have not lived up to)to come to Caldwell County why don't you insist on lowering the taxes on all citizens especially small businesses with many of the same incentives. Oil drilling is no longer the spectacle it once was so let them drill, I know as I was born a Texan. I guarantee you that if you did these things the state's revenue coffers will again have a surplus instead of a deficit. It would bring jobs to North Carolina including the ones I had hoped to be able to offer. The only thing is that you will also have to do the best you can to protect the interests of the citizens of North Carolina from the unconstitutional provisions being made against We The People by the federal gov't. Remember you work for us not the other way around. I would be so proud to support you in any way I could if you would take an independent stance on all these issues I have presented to you and do the right thing for our state and country. Thank you for your time, the consideration of my views, and your service even though our differing realities are not in sink. Beverly Mihelich

DEAR GOVERNOR PURDUE, 
I JUST WROTE TO YOU REGARDING OUR BEACH RECLASSIFICATION PROJECT, HOWEVER, I ALSO WANTED TO GIVE YOU AND YOUR OFFICE MY REACTION TO THE GROSS EXTENSIVE  SPENDING IN WASHINGTON.
I AM NOT IN FAVOR OF "TOO BIG TO FAIL". OR THE AUTOMOTIVE BAIL-OUT, OR THE BANKS.........
THERE MAYBE SOME SENSE TO THEIR PLAN IN 2020. BUT MY HUSBAND AND I ARE 68 YEARS OLD. 'WE HAVE 3 SONS AND 7 GRANDCHILDREN. (TWO SONS AND 4 GRANDCHILDREN LIVE IN RALEIGH.) IF THE TAX BURDEN TO LIVE AND WORK IN THIS COUNTRY KEEPS CLIMBING, WE WILL BE AT 66% + TAX RATES FOR EVERYONE AND NO ONE WILL AFFORD ANYTHING BUT LOW INCOME HOUSING AND POSSIBLY FOOD.  ALL THE OTHER THINGS, THIS STIMULUS IS SUPPOSED TO DO WILL BE LONG GONE AND WORTH-LESS AND THE FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL BE PAYING THE BILL.
AL OF THIS IS NOT FAIR. I BELIEVE THIS ADMINISTRATION IS PAYING BACK CERTAIN FOCUS GROUPS FOR BEING ELECTED. THE UNIONS, THE TEACHERS AND AUTO-WORKERS, THE MINORITIES, AS WELL AS ILLEGALS. THE ACORN SOCIETY HAS RECIEVED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE STIMULUS BILL AND 
ARE MIS-USING THOSE FUNDS, AS RECENTLY EXPOSED, TO AID IN DECEPTION OF THE GOVERNMENT.
JUST AS THEY DID WHEN THEY REGISTERED VOTERS WHO WERE NOT LEGAL CITIZENS OR COULDN'T MEET THE CRITERIA TO VOTE IN THEIR STATE.  THEY BUSSED THEM TO ANOTHER STATE, SO THEY COULD VOTE. 
THIS IS  NOT THE BEGINNING OF FRAUD AND DECEPTION, BUT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FRAUD AND DECEPTION TO RISE TO NEW LEVELS.  AND NOW WE THE TAXPAYERS ARE GIVING OUR MONEY TO HELP KEEP THE SCHEMEING ALIVE.  PLEASE NOTE MY HUSBAND AND I ARE TOTALLY AGAINST WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING.
THANK-YOU IN ADVANCE FOR ADDING MY NAME TO THE LIST OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT PLEASED WITH WHAT THE HOUSE AND CONGRESS AND PRESIDENT ARE DOING. 
SINCERELY, CAROLYN PUSATERI, 4110 ISLAND DR. N. TOPSAIL BEACH, N.C. 28460   (910) 328-2998

9/11 - National Day of Service and Remembrance

Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance and the culmination of the “United We Serve” campaign.  Governor Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet<attb4644.JPG>Secretaries, Governor’s Office staff, state government employees and citizens across North Carolina have participated in this campaign to serve others.
Volunteering always is important, but this especially rings true in these tough economic times when so many need so much help.  
On Thursday, Gov. Perdue helped launch “Books on Bases, Smiles on Faces,” a literacy program for military children by Blue Star Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).   She spoke to military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read “Home is Where the Army Sends You” by local author Melissa Davis.  She also helped distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high population of military children.
<attba270.JPG>The Governor also announced that N.C. AmeriCorps members and N.C. National Guard armories have united in a service project to honor military families.  The theme was “Little Heroes Family Connection.” AmeriCorps program members gathered across the state to collect items and assemble packages to help children create a message for deployed parents or family members.
“Through this United We Serve project, North Carolina’s AmeriCorps members and National Guard have shown that it only takes a small effort to give something back to their communities,” Perdue said. “By serving — we honor those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we <attc1967.JPG>build strong families and strong communities all over North Carolina.”
Today, Governor Perdue planted collard greens and cabbages at the Executive Mansion as part of the “Plant a Row for the Hungry” campaign.  Plant a Row (PAR) is a national campaign to encourage all gardeners to grow a little extra produce to donate to the hungry and homeless.  The Raleigh PAR campaign collects produce to donate to the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle.

Gov. Perdue Vetoes Bill That Would Limit Access to Public Records

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday vetoed House Bill 104, “An Act To Clarify Legislative Confidentiality.”
“Transparency and accountability are hallmarks of my administration.  If this legislation became law, documents that are currently public record would become private,” said Perdue.  “Additionally, this bill treats certain state employees unequally.”
The General Assembly passed the legislation on August 10 after making significant changes during the last days of legislative session.
Pursuant to the Constitution, the Governor must call a special session no later than September 20 unless a majority of each house signs a written document stating that there is no need for the session to be convened.

Gov. Perdue Calls for Focus on Prevention as Flu Season Arrives

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday called on North Carolina residents to re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of the school year and the arrival of flu season.
<FLU4.jpg>“Parents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,” Perdue said.  “I don’t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.”
Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line of prevention;
- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
> - If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.
> - Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.
> - Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
> - Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
> - If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.
> - Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.

Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.
<Housing5.jpg>“When a home is foreclosed — it’s bad for our families, it’s bad for our communities, it’s bad for our businesses and it’s bad for North Carolina,” said Perdue.  “This bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.”
Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.
SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.
Consumer tips on home loans, debt collectors and many other topics are available from the Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division at <http://www.ncdoj.gov>www.ncdoj.gov.

Furniture Maker Brings New Plant, 128 Jobs to Alexander County

Caye Home Furnishings, an international manufacturer of custom home furniture, will open a new plant in Taylorsville.  The company plans to invest $1.4 million and create 128 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
<atteb755.jpg>“North Carolina, known worldwide for producing fine furniture, continues to be a leading player in this vital manufacturing sector,” Perdue said.  “Our state’s skilled workforce and superb quality of life continue to attract growing companies like Caye Home Furnishings.”
Caye Home Furnishings LLC, headquartered in Mississippi, manufactures living room furniture and case goods including products marketed under the Stratford and Stratolounger name brands.  The company has five manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, Florida, two in China and one in Star, N.C., which opened in August 2008 and employs 52 workers.  The new Taylorsville plant will assemble furniture products to serve that growing market.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $30,142, not including benefits, which is higher than Alexander County’s average annual wage of $27,300.

Gov. Perdue Announces 3,514 Arrests During 15th Anniversary "Booze It & Lose It" Campaign

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that state and local law enforcement officers cited 3,514 motorists for driving while impaired during the Labor Day “Booze It & Lose It” campaign, which ran Aug. 21-Sept 7.  A total of 105,370 traffic and criminal citations were issued statewide.
“Law enforcement officers statewide are the key reason this initiative has been so successful over the past 15 years and I commend their continued dedication,” Perdue said.  “Their efforts during this campaign allowed for more families to enjoy the end of summer.”
During the Governor’s Highway Safety Program campaign, officers statewide conducted more than 10,500 sobriety checkpoints and dedicated patrols.  Officers also issued 10,416 safety belt and 1,533 child passenger safety violations, 30,830 speeding violations and 1,819 drug charges. In addition, they apprehended 829 fugitives from justice and recovered 120 stolen vehicles.

TurboCare Inc., a subsidiary of Siemens Energy that provides turbomachinery parts and services to companies around the world, will expand its Forsyth County facility, creating 110 jobs and investing $30 million during the next three years.  The announcement was made<att43a6.jpg>possible in part by a $220,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
“TurboCare’s expansion is a win for Rural Hall and for North Carolina,” Perdue said. “That so many international companies doing business in North Carolina choose to expand here when they have options around the country and around the world shows that our commitments to education, training and a business-friendly environment continue to prove successful.”
TurboCare offers service solutions in the industrial and power generation markets in more than 100 countries. It provides a complete range of component repair, equipment refurbishment, system retrofits, engineering and parts replacement services with 2,500 workers worldwide. That includes 176 current employees in Rural Hall.
Salaries for the 110 new workers will vary by job function, but the overall average wage will be $45,855 a year, not including benefits. That is higher than the Forsyth County average annual wage of $39,936 without benefits.

Gov. Perdue Announces the Blue Ridge Parkway to be Honored in U.S. Mint Program

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday announced that the Blue Ridge Parkway will be honored in the new U.S. Mint America the Beautiful Quarters program.  Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner approved the list of sites recommended by the U.S. Mint on Aug. 25, 2009, after consultation with Governor Perdue and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. 
>  
> “Countless visitors from around the world have lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway – one of America’s great treasures,” said Perdue. “Now the lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway and its majestic legacy will be captured on these special coins.”
The United States Mint’s America the Beautiful Quarters Program is a 12-year initiative authorized by the America’s Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008.  The act directs the United States Mint to strike and issue 56 circulating quarters with tails side designs emblematic of a national park or other national site in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories — Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands.
The quarters will be issued sequentially each year, in the order in which the featured site was first established as a national park or site.  The coins’ heads side will feature the familiar “restored” 1932 portrait of George Washington, including subtle details and the beauty of the original model.
To view the complete National Site Registry, which lists all 56 sites to be honored under the U.S. Mint’s America the Beautiful Quarters Program in chronological order by year, please visit <http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/NSQuartersProgram/?action=siteRegister>www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/NSQuartersProgram/?action=siteRegister.

<http://worldviewtimes.com/article.php/articleid-5388/Brannon-Howse/Brannon-Howse>Is America at a Dangerous Tipping Point for Receiving God's Judgment?
By Brannon Howse
When God finally chooses to bring His judgment on America, it would be a waste of time to even pray for mercy. No need for a national day of prayer. In Jeremiah 7:16 God Himself declares to Jeremiah not to pray for Judah. "Therefore do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or a prayer for them, nor make intercession to Me: for I will not hear you." In Jeremiah 15:1 God tells Jeremiah, "Even if Moses and Samuel stood before Me, My mind would not be favorable toward this people." Then in Ezekiel 14 God says that when a nation sins against God in persistent unfaithfulness He will stretch out His hand against it. In verse 14 God says, "Even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver only themselves."

Brannon Howse's New Book
<http://www.worldviewweekend.com/secure/store/product.php?ProductID=1044>The People & Worldviews Destroying America From The Grave

Brannon reveals how the worldviews of 20 dead people are still influencing every aspect of American life and vying for the hearts and minds of adults and students. Whether we are discussing, law, science, economics, history, family, social issues, education or religion, the people and worldviews seeking to further their agenda in these disciplines are almost always connected back to four major forces. Brannon reveals the connection between occultism/pagan spirituality, the apostate church, the educational establishment and government/corporations.

Here is the list of twenty for which Brannon has dug up worldview facts you must know and prepare to oppose:

Saul Alinsky, Karl Marx, John Dewey, John Maynard Keynes, Aldous Huxley, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, Margaret Sanger, William James, Alice Bailey, Helen Schuman, Sigmund Freud, Alfred Kinsey, Benjamin Bloom, B.F. Skinner, The Frankfurt School, Soren Kierkegaard, Julius Wellhausen, Christopher Columbus Langdell, Betty Friedan

By Phyllis Schlafly
A significant part of Barack Obama's plan to "change" America involves having the federal government take control of public school curriculum, plus compiling a database of personal information about each student. The takeover is planned to be accomplished by talking directly to the kids in their schools, and by attaching extraordinary strings to the $128 billion of Stimulus funds shoveled into education.

This issues Theme: The Worldviews and People Destroying America From the Grave and a Christian Response

Our last magazine was distributed to nearly 100,000 in just sixteen weeks until the magazine went out of print. Don't delay get your order in today.

Brannon includes articles on the Worldviews and People Destroying America From The Grave. This is a revealing look at the public policy and horrendous, perverted, and tragic personal lives of individuals like John Maynard Keynes, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, Margaret Sanger and others. How have the worldviews of these individuals been implemented into America’s economy, education, sociology, and other areas of American life? The point is made that worldviews matter and have consequences. To understand America's spiritual battle for survival, we must understand the destructive worldviews working in the background and foreground. These articles were birthed out of the overwhelming amount of requests our office received for written materials based on what Brannon was talking about on his radio program and on numerous national radio programs on which he was a guest.

<http://worldviewtimes.com/article.php/articleid-5369/Brannon-Howse/Brannon-Howse>Personal Notes and Thoughts Written by Brannon Howse during President Obama's Speech on HealthCare to the U.S. Congress
By Brannon Howse
I think Obama is using the Hegelian Dialectic Process which I predicted week ago is what he was doing. Obama is saying we need to merge the ideas of the left and the right for a better third option or Third Way. I have predicted that if Obama could not get what he wanted then he would allow the left and right to fight it out and then offer the third option which makes both sides feel like they won something. In fact, Obama may have begun by wanting his plan but knowing that option C was his end game goal for now. Once he gets the option C that he is proposing, he will then start over with two views conflicting and then move again to a third option, allowing him to kick the can further down the road each time. Obama set up the conflict to bring the change just as Saul Alinksy calls for in Rules for Radicals. However, I think he will push to get 100% of what he wants but fall back on the third option.

> Conservative Woodstock Rocks the Capital

> Patriotic anti-big-government taxpayers blast through the million protester mark
September 12, 2009, Washington, D.C.
<http://www.lookingattheleft.com/2009/09/conservative-woodstock-rocks-the-capital/>http://www.lookingattheleft.com/2009/09/conservative-woodstock-rocks-the-capital/
ABC News reports that two million Americans flooded D.C. in what people in the crowd were calling â€œa conservative Woodstockâ€ Like the liberal Woodstock of the â€™60s, thousands were rumored stranded on freeways. Some walked in to DC, ditching their cars and busses. I walked with a 5 deep 6 block long column of protesters from Pennsylvania Avenue who had walked miles from where they had to leave their busses. Networks including Fox News continued through the time Iâ€™m writing this at 8 p.m. local Eastern time reporting that â€œtens of thousandsâ€ showed up. Whasup with that?  When will we get some reliable reporting out of the corporate media types?
This event had been promoted as a taxpayer â€œtea partyâ€ but the crowdâ€™s concerns were wide ranging, from outrage at ACORN and Obamaâ€™s socialist cadre known as Czars, to Obamaâ€™s untruthfulness. Protesters also displayed signs mocking Nancy Pelosi and others for smearing the grassroots movement as â€œastroturfersâ€ and as an angry mob.
I think this gathering should be appreciated as the extremely important historical event that it is. This is the first great conservative anti-statist manifestation in American history. The conservative movement, which developed in the post-WWII, Cold War environment has now fully matured into the most significant political movement of the 21st century. I believe that this day could be referred to in the not too distant future as the day that changed America. This was the day the great silent conservative majority finally found its voice.  
Many of the attendees were quite meek and timid and were unsure of exactly what to expect, this being the first time in their lives theyâ€™d been involved in a protest movement. Their fears evaporated early in the day and I saw people reveling in the camaraderie , the joy and sheer civility that was exhibited at the entire event. Chants of â€œFreedom, freedom, freedomâ€, â€œNo more czars! No more czars!â€ carried through the air without the slightest hint of rancor or incivility which is the norm at the leftist rallies I have photographed over the years. 
The two photos above show a tiny fraction of the two million ABC estimates attended. I saw signs and heard lots of comments comparing this event to Woodstock. At the time this photo was taken, around 1:00 p.m., Pennsylvania Avenue was still jammed completely, and the mall was packed from the Capitol Building past the Washington Monument. See aerial photos<http://moderateinthemiddle.wordpress.com/2009/09/12/d-c-police-close-roads-to-buses-people-on-footestimate-1-2-millionl-abc-reports-2-million912-party-on-patriots/> here.
Protesters came from every state in the union. This man came from San Antonio, TX. He said that he was really sorry he hadnâ€™t brought his family. He stated that being a black conservative he was afraid to expose his children to what he expected would be a lot of liberal abuse. He was thrilled with the tenor of the event and the fact that no liberals were present to harass him. He spoke about how incredibly intolerant the left is to black individuals who donâ€™t bow to the party line.
 These Ohioans took a day off their rodeo bullriding schedule. They said theyâ€™ll be back at it tomorrow.
Mike Pence (R-Indiana) was one of the speakers who addressed the crowd: â€œAfter years of fighting runaway government on this hill, you people look like the cavalry to me..I believe we are on the verge of a great American awakening.â€


>  

> 
> San Diego radio host Mason Weaver said from the podium: â€œI came here because I thought you might want to hear a black man speak without a teleprompterâ€¦This government is trying to make a nation of dependent people. Americans have always been independent peopleâ€¦This is not a Republican thing, itâ€™s not a Democrat thing. Itâ€™s not a black thing or a white thing. Itâ€™s an American thingâ€¦We the people are telling them â€˜No more! Weâ€™ve had enough!â€

In the very center of the photo, above the Silence is Consent â€“ Can You Hear Us Now sign, you can see Pennsylvania Ave., which at this time is totally blocked with protesters who cannot move forward to the Capitol area. Sorry, full up.

There were notable differences though, in the behavior of these attendees. Although the legend of Woodstock is that there was a friendly atmosphere of camaraderie, the truth is that most people were there for the drugs, sex and rock and roll. Today in D.C. there was a true kinship amongst these people based on shared values and intellectual understanding of what America is and how its future is imperiled by big radical government.
No one was having sex in the Reflecting Pool let alone the mud, and I saw no one projectile vomiting on the steps of the Capitol. There were no warnings to avoid the bad acid which would send you on a trip to the hospital. Not just a different era, but a different level of civilized behavior and thought. Oh, and by the way, these people didnâ€™t leave tons of garbage behind when they left. Actually they left no trash behind at all.

Well that's because the Libs gave the word liberal such a bad smell by their behavior and policies over the years that they had to abandon it. They started referring to themselves as progressives and figured no one would notice the wordâ€™s communist pedigree. It means progress on the road to socialism and Castro understands it that way. Well shazzam Martha, look at that! The president really is a progressive just like NPR says !!

Nancy Pelosi has accused patriotic tea-party goers of â€œcarrying swastikasâ€ implying that they are Nazi sympathizers or worse. This event was knee deep in hammers and sickles and words like â€œsocialistâ€ â€œcommunistâ€ and â€œMarxistâ€. It continues to fascinate me how the Democrat Party tolerates this without ever commenting on it. When will the MSM ask the questions about his The High Oneâ€™s communist buddies and endorsers? And why do people who absolutely loath the USA, like Castro, Chavez, Ortega, and Michael Moore worship at the alter of Obama? Well at least the communists who endorse him have no qualms about telling it like it is.
Ever present at Tea Parties are Sons of Liberty re-enactors. The couple on the left is from Tennessee and the young lady on the right is not but she joined in the photo. The clothing for the couple was hand stitched by the lady on the left. And boy do they love America.

This gives us pause to believe that NC was a victim of ACORN in the election, and this illegal prostitution tapes of ACORN HOUSING supporting this activity and willingness to commit illegal activity disqualifies the organization for ANY TAXPAYER DOLLARS..REVOKE ANY NC NON PROFIT STATUS, and seek an investigation into illegal voter fraud, housing fraud and illegal prostitution rings possibly subsidized by taxapyer dollars through ACORN.

Comment: Wesley Garner 101 JJ Ln Goldsboro, NC 27530-9421 September 15, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Governor Perdue: Boehner, House GOP Move to Stop All Federal Funding of ACORN WASHINGTON, DC - House Republican Leader John Boehner (R-OH) today is introducing legislation - the Defund ACORN Act - to sever all ties between the federal government and the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN). At the same time, House Republicans are also sending a letter to President Obama asking him to take action to end taxpayer funding of ACORN. Boehner issued the following statement: "It is evident that ACORN is incapable of using federal funds in a manner that is consistent with the law. Immediate action is necessary to ensure that no additional tax dollars are directed to ACORN. Simply put, ACORN should not receive another penny of American taxpayers' money. "It is outrageous that ACORN continues to receive taxpayer dollars after repeated revelations of corruption and potentially criminal activity. House Republicans are responding and taking action to terminate all federal funding to ACORN and its affiliates. We've asked the President to end all federal funding of ACORN - and if the administration does not act, we have a bill to stop federal funding of ACORN once and for all. "I support the Census Bureau's decision to end its relationship with ACORN, and believe it is vital that all other federal agencies follow its example. All ties between the federal government and ACORN and its affiliates must be cut, whether those ties consist of partnerships or the awarding of federal funds, including federal funds distributed through state and local governments from federal block grants. "This is a matter of common sense and respect for taxpayer dollars." NOTE: An analysis of federal data by the Office of the Republican Leader staff determined that ACORN has received more than $53 million in direct funding from the federal government since 1994, and has likely received substantially more indirectly through states and localities that receive federal block grants. Today House Republicans, led by led Boehner, are sending a letter to President Obama asking him to use his authority to end all funding to and break all government ties with ACORN. Boehner also sent a letter to President Bush, and a letter to then-Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Steven Preston, last year requesting that they block funding to ACORN. It seems ACORN has done another no no. It may be time to check out ACORNS actions in N.C. We can not afford repeated revelations of corruption and potentially criminal activity.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park's 75th Anniversary Rededication

On Wednesday, Governor Perdue participated in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park's 75th anniversary rededication ceremony.  Rangers estimated more than two thousand people joined Gov. Perdue, Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen and other dignitaries - including singer/songwriter Dolly Parton.


Gov. Perdue celebrated the Park's 75th anniversary standing onstage literally with one foot in North Carolina and one foot in Tennessee. But what makes the smokies special, she said, is that "when we are here, there is no North Carolina or Tennessee. There is only this most precious of national resources, the Great Smoky Mountains."

Gov. Perdue Designates September As Library Card Sign-Up Month

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday designated September as <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ProclamationDetail.aspx?newsItemID=598>Library Card Sign-up Month in North Carolina, encouraging children, families and North Carolina residents to explore their public library and its many resources and to sign up for the “smartest card.”

“A public library card gives you access to a whole world of information and imagination,” said Gov. Perdue. “During these tough economic times, our state’s public libraries are critical because they help residents learn to read, use computers and develop other skills they need to succeed.”

During September the State Library of North Carolina, the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, <http://www.ncculture.com>www.ncculture.com and libraries from Murphy to Manteo, both rural and urban, join to spread the message that the library card is the “smartest card” to have in your wallet.  The goal is to make the library card the most valued and used card for North Carolina residents. Nearly five million North Carolinians are card-carrying library users.

During the last fiscal year there were more than 37 million visits to North Carolina public libraries and more than 9 million of them used library computers.

Growth in materials being checked out, customer visits and especially internet use at libraries continues a trend. Nationally, public library visits are up 19% from 2000 to 2006.  Circulation of library materials is up 20%.  Access to public computers is up 86%.

The "Smartest Card" initiative is part of The Campaign for America's Libraries, a multi-year public awareness and advocacy effort by the American Library Association.  Begun in 2004, the campaign promotes the value of public libraries nationwide.

Penland School of Crafts

On Tuesday, Gov. Perdue visited the Penland School of Crafts near Asheville.  The school is a national center for craft education.  They offer classes in many different types of crafts from glass and metal work to photography, and they sponsor artist residencies, community education and a gallery.  Gov. Perdue spent time in the gallery, talked with artists and toured their studios.  Go to Penland.org to find out more.

Mecklenburg County Clean-Energy Company to Add 61 Jobs

SCR-Tech LLC, a leading national provider of cost-effective emissions control solutions for power plants, will expand and add an additional facility in Charlotte.  The company plans to invest more than $12.4 million over the next five years in capital and lease payments for the expansion and for new technologies. During the next three years, the company plans to create 61 new jobs in Mecklenburg County.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $90,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

“North Carolina is a national leader in promoting clean, green technologies,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Companies like SCR-Tech are expanding to tap into the emerging market for green-friendly products while enjoying our state’s top business climate and knowledge-based workforce.”

The 61 new jobs will pay an overall average wage of $49,372, not including benefits.

SCR-Tech is wholly owned by CoaLogix Inc., which provides innovative solutions for clean energy production with a focus on cost-effective emissions control solutions for the coal and gas-fired power generation industry. The company, with headquarters in Charlotte, currently provides selective catalyst reduction (SCR) regeneration technologies and SCR management services to reduce its customers’ environmental footprint.

Comment: Kay Did you know that Americorp is part of acorn the peolple in your office don't see below AmeriCorps and ACORN Go Way Back By Matthew Vadum on 6.17.09 @ 8:02PM The cynical, politically motivated, and apparently illegal firing of AmeriCorps Inspector General Gerald Walpin shocks the conscience. I'm not going to examine here the circumstances surrounding the termination of Walpin but I do wish to remind readers that AmeriCorps has long been ripe for abuse. ACORN took advantage of the federal agency a decade ago. As I wrote previously, ACORN, which is now notorious for its commingling of funds within its network of affiliates, used government resources to promote legislation. A congressional report noted that there was "apparent cross-over funding between ACORN, a political advocacy group and ACORN Housing Corp. (AHC), a non profit, AmeriCorp [sic] grantee" that is a major affiliate of ACORN. The government-funded AmeriCorps, which promotes public service, suspended AHC's funding "after it was learned that AHC and ACORN shared office space and equipment and failed to assure that activities and funds were wholly separate." The report noted that, "AmeriCorps members of AHC raised funds for ACORN, performed voter registration activities, and gave partisan speeches. In one instance, an AmeriCorps member was directed by ACORN staff to assist the [Clinton] White House in preparing a press conference in support of legislation." ("Report on the Activities of the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities During the 104th Congress," Report 104-875, January 2, 1997) Why aren't you investigating Acorn(Americorp)? North Carolina is giving 4 million to them . Joan

California Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger joined a growing chorus of officials today and called on the state's attorney general to launch an investigation into ACORN due to the latest charges of illegal activity by the group, this time in San Bernardino, Calif. Over the past few days, I have seen a series of news stories regarding the ACORN organization that have concerned me greatly...

Comment: Investigate ACORN, COI and affiliates and FREEZE FUNDS Now!! Another day, another video of ACORN employees coaching, suggesting and in this case, offering to physically assist in illegal and immoral activites. The latest video (the fifth - Baltimore, DC, NYC, San Bernadino, San Diego) shows an ACORN employee offering to actually aid in transporting under age child sex slaves into the US. Please, go on record demanding a freeze in all state funds to this organization (like the US Census and US Senate has)and demand an immediate investigation (like NY Attorney General, California Governor and Minnesota Governor has). Be our voice in Raleigh and protect our state tax funds. The ACORN behavior is CLEARLY beyond an isolated event and clearly shows a pattern beyond "low level staffers". This immoral and illegal behavior is SYSTEMIC in ACORN and must be de-funded and investigated. Do the right thing!!!

ACORN and the CRA

<http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article.aspx?id=506246> Acorn's a Creature of the CRA
Steven Malanga, Investor's Business Daily, September 17, 2009
(This article originally appeared on <http://www.realclearmarkets.com/2009/09/16/>RealClearMarkets.com, 9-16-09)
. . .Acorn found its way into the mortgage business through the Community Reinvestment Act, the 1977 legislation that community groups have used as a cudgel to force lenders to lower their mortgage underwriting standards in order to make more loans in low-income communities. . .On Capitol Hill, the House Committee on Financial Services under Chairman Barney Frank held hearings Wednesday on legislation supported by the Obama administration that would bring insurance companies and credit unions under the umbrella of CRA, placing new lending demands on these groups and opening them up to protests and pressure tactics by organizations like Acorn. . .Any review of the history of the affordable mortgage movement in America demonstrates the power that CRA had in helping to shred mortgage underwriting standards throughout the industry and exposing us to the kind of market meltdown we've experienced. . .

Is ObamaCare Rescission on a National Scale?

<http://frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=36317> ObamaCare: Insurance Rescission on a National Scale
David Gratzer, FrontPageMag.com, September 16, 2009
In his speech before Congress, President Obama shifted political attention to the one health-care issue where Democrats are gaining ground: consumer protection. He opened his address with heart-rending stories of sick Americans who lost their health coverage while they were ill, suffering and even dying because of resulting uncertainties over treatment. In legal jargon, rescission simply means "putting a contract aside." In health-care policy jargon, it's when an insurance company finds a reason to suspend or revoke existing health coverage. To Democrats, this practice represents the worst of American health care - which is why the President referred to it last Wednesday. But we need to ask: do Democrats have a sensible alternative . . .

Specter's EFCA 'Compromise'

<http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2009/09/17/dont_buy_specters_efca_compromise_97412.html> Don't Buy Specter's EFCA "Compromise"
Diana Furchtgott-Roth, RealClearMarkets.com, September 17, 2009
In Pittsburgh on Tuesday at the AFL-CIO convention, Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Democrat who left the Republican Party last spring, produced a new version of a favorite piece of union legislation in the guise of a "compromise". . .With a tough reelection fight coming up next year, Mr. Specter's opposition to the Employee Free Choice Act was potentially costing him votes. So he announced-at an AFL-CIO convention in his home state-support for an alternative to the card-check provision that has been endorsed by the Federation's newly retired president, John J. Sweeney. Mr. Specter's announcement was greeted with raucous applause. He says his new bill can pass the Senate. . .

Opening arguments were presented to a Pennsylvania state court jury on Tuesday in a test case that charges that GlaxoSmithKline covered up studies suggesting that Paxil, its successful antidepressant, causes birth defects. Michelle David, a former cheerleader for the Philadelphia 76ers, sued on behalf of her 3-year-old son, claiming that her son's heart defects were caused by her consumption of Paxil. . .
