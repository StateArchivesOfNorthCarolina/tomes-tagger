Subject: Rewards for Money Saving Ideas in N&O article 8/23/2009

Comment: I am a High School teacher and Coach for 38 years. With the current economy in the state that it is, we need to save all of the money that we can. Several years ago, our school system (Nash Rocky Mount Schools) ask for ways to help with the substitute teacher issue. I wrote up a proposal, based on information from my uncle who was the Superintendent and relative in another school board member and sent it to the central office. Nothing came out of the proposal. Maybe, you will find this beneficial. I feel that central officer personnel should be willing to substitute in their local schools at least a couple times a year. They are familiar with the culture in the schools, know the administrators, and will make them more aware of what is actually going on in their school system. Teachers are asked to do extra duties (nights, weekends, etc.) on the spur of the moment and I feel that this would create a greater collaberative effort with the central officer personnel and the local schools. This would eliminate many of the problems with discipline, substitute money, and issues that go on when substitutes that are not familiar with the school culture are brought in. I feel that Central officer personnel and school board members are so far removed from the actual school day to day,that they are not aware of how much public education has changed. I will be glad to be more specific about recommendations and would love to speak personnally with someone about this to provide more insight if felt that it would be beneficial. I was a double dipper for several years, and I have seen many, many problems develop at schools because of poor substitute teachers. Please contact me if you would like to discuss further. We tried to find the right web site to send this, hopefully, you will get to the right area. Kind Regards, Boyd Shaw 252-443-3849

Subject: Money Saving Idea

Comment: Governor Perdue ask for money saving idea's and the suggestion could earn the submitter a reward if it was found to save the State of NC money. My suggestion is to start using an envelope that is called a two way envelope. It saves money by cutting the cost of sending a return envelope inside correspondence. The envelope has a inside flap that pulls out sticks to the original envelope that is used to resend itself back to the sender. This would cut the expenses of envelopes approximately in half to the State Of NC.

Subject: Suggestion for saving tax dollars

Comment: State tax refunds could be issued as direct deposits and this would save alot of postage cost. The federal refunds are direct deposited and I think the state probably could do the same. Why dont we go back to the old times, and use parents and volunteers as classroom volunteers and not have to pay as many classroom assistants for the young children. We had parents as substitute teachers when I went to school. Thanks Good luck with the state funds. Times are tough now. Thanks Brenda Stanley

Subject: money

Comment: My suggestion to save money is to get DOT to do things correctly the first time. Case in point: Highway 70 in Raleigh near Briarcreek had reflectors added today in the same manner they have been placed in the past - on top of the asphault. The first time the streets need to be scraped due to snow those reflectors will be scraped off the road exactly as they have been on other highways and streets. For two years, until the streets were finally swept, reflectors were laying on the side of Leesville Road after being scraped off with a previous snow. This is a waste of my tax money. Doing jobs correctly the first time saves money.

Subject: property taxes for home renters...

Comment: During these difficult economic times, I recognize that everyone is making different kinds of decisions to survive financially. I can only stipulate on the creative exchange taking place at all levels of government during these times. Has the idea of imposing property taxes (e.g. renter's tax) on home renters been given serious consideration? NC currently imposes property taxes on leased vehicles. Why not do the same on leased homes (e.g. apartments)? Curious, -Edwin GirÃ³n 919-521-4353

Subject: Where to look for sunstantial budget savings

Comment: Over the last 20 years the administrative staff of University of North Carolina System has bloated under the public radar screen. The same has happened at NCSU and at UNC-CH. Perhaps it is time that Governor Purdue will appoint an executive panel to examine these bloated administrations and the egregious salaries and terms of employment that some of these administrators receive for the value and beefits of their service. It has been suggested that North Carolia can probably find at least $100 million annually in savings by right-sizing the these administrative functions and adjusting administrators compensation and employment terms to their fair market value. Thank you.

Subject: Cost saving suggestions for NC

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I was inspired to write you after watching you make a brief speech to state employees on the Internet. You asked that if we had any suggestions regarding how the state could save money, to send them to you. I work as a medical records assistant with the NCDOC and have several suggestions that I hope you will consider. I submitted this suggestion to the DOC not long after I was hired, but it was not used. I worked as jail nurse for a private company at a local detention center for a few years. All the inmates in jail were charged for their medicatiion unless they were indigent and had no money in their account to pay. Then, of course, the medicine was provided to them free. This covered all medications, including insulin. It was a nominal fee; I think 50 cents for a one time dose of Ibuprofen, etc., or $3.00 for a month's supply of medication. The prison system does not charge inmates for medication at all. Though I am not necessarily suggesting that inmates with chronic diseases such as high blood pressure or diabetes pay for their medications, there are many other medications or health items they could be charged for. For instance, some inmates are medically issued "beauty stones" which are actually pumice stones for their feet. I also don't think tax payers should be liable for the cost of ibuprofen or a muscle relaxer if an inmate goes out and hurts their back lifting weights. It may not seem like much, but considering how many inmates across the state get special shampoo, sinus medicine, and shoe insoles, I think it would add up to a great deal. If they just had to pay $3.00 a month or whatever for medicine not connected to a chronic disease (as identified in DOC policy), it would save the state a fortune. I wouldn't mind seeing charges be applied to chronic disease medications either, but I don't think the DOC could be convinced to do this. I don't wish anyone be denied medical treatment becuase they can't pay - at the jail the computer automatically adjusted the charges and some inmates were permanently "in the red", but they still received proper medical care. Since inmates are charged to see the nurse with the exception of a few things such as emergencies and chronic illnesses, I think it would be simple to adjust the computer program to add charges for medication. I have another suggestion regarding abuse of state vehicles. I think use of state vehicles for personal use or joy-riding should be eliminated. The mileage log may read one thing, but the trip taken may have been entirely different. For instance, I don't think state cars should be driven by someone in a high ranking position to go to lunch, unless he or she is stopping en route to a business meeting. Gas and vehicle maintenance are to expensive for that. If someone is not required to travel on their job routinely and they take out a state car almost every day at lunch time, something is wrong. I would appreciate it if my name isn't mentioned if anyone addresses the misuse of state vehicles because I don't want to lose my job. Thank you so much for hearing me out. I hope you have a pleasant weekend. Sincerely, Angela Jones

Dear Governor,

My suggestions:

1.  Lower taxes.

2.  Eliminate unnecessary and wasteful public employment positions.

3.  Raise class size for teachers.

4.  Eliminate teacher assistant positions.

5. Require year round schools everywhere and have teachers work year round at the same salaries they are now getting.

6.  Reduce state employee health care costs by providing Health Savings Accounts.

7.  Raise state employee retirement ages and reduce benefits.

8.  Encourage more self-sufficiency in state retirement programs by encouraging more 403B's.

There you are.

Regards.

Michael W. Taylor

Gov. Perdue on Tuesday  convened the first meeting of the Budget Reform and Accountability Commission (BRAC) and launched a new Webpage, <http://brac.nc.gov>brac.nc.gov, so that citizens may make recommendations to the commission.

> “As North Carolina continues to be deeply affected by this national recession, state government must ensure that every tax dollar is used as efficiently and wisely as possible,” Perdue said.  “I look forward to working with BRAC members to meet these challenges head-on, without shying away from politically tough decisions.”

> Perdue established BRAC in January via <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=429> Executive Order #5 to locate and eliminate wasteful expenditures while increasing efficiency in government.

> In the short term, the commission is expected to come up with ideas that can be enacted quickly to help the state save money.  Its goal will be to have recommendations in time for next year’s legislative short session.

> In the long term, BRAC will examine state government and make innovative recommendations to:

> • eliminate unnecessary or unsuccessful programs;
> • consolidate where possible and ensure we are investing effectively and efficiently;
> • and to streamline the way state government works.

> Suggestions for initiatives that BRAC will consider may come from a variety of sources, including state agencies, BRAC members, and from the public at large.  The commission also urges citizens to make recommendations using the new Webpage, <http://brac.nc.gov>brac.nc.gov.

> Governor Rides the Bus for the First Day of School

Gov. Perdue on Tuesday took the bus to school with kids from Conn Elementary in Raleigh.  She talked with parents and excited kids waiting for the bus on their first day back from summer vacation.  When she arrived at the school, Gov. Perdue visited classrooms, spoke with teachers and addressed the students on the school's morning TV news show.

> Governor Fully Restores School Lottery Funds

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced she is fully restoring funds to the lottery capital fund for public schools.

> “When the national recession created a shortfall of billions of dollars, I had to turn over every stone to pay North Carolina’s bills — to pay teachers, to keep schools and other core services running,” Perdue said. “With our bills paid and the books for last fiscal year cleared out, I’m restoring the school construction lottery funds in full, which means North Carolina’s public schools will receive another $37.6 million next week.”

> In February, Perdue withheld $37.6 million during the 2008-09 fiscal year from the Public School Building Capital Fund to ensure the state had sufficient resources to manage cash flow and payroll obligations. That money is being restored using funds left over from the 2008-09 fiscal year.

> Gov. Perdue Signs Bill to Attract More Film Industry Jobs

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday  signed Senate Bill 943 allowing production companies a 25 percent tax credit for film projects in North Carolina, up from the previous credit of 15 percent.  The bill also sets minimum spending and hiring requirements for qualifying film companies working in the state.

> “This legislation will help grow our $91 million motion picture industry, preserve and create thousands of jobs and increase investments in yet another emerging economic cluster,” said Perdue. “Providing a strong foundation for North Carolina’s film industry is essential as we work to build a strong and sustainable economy through increased diversification.”

> SB 943 ensures North Carolina remains a strong competitor for film production dollars, which totaled $91 million in direct spending in 2008.  The industry employs more than 2,500 statewide.  Recent major motion pictures filmed in the state include “Nights in Rodanthe,” “Leatherheads” and “The Secret Life of Bees.”  The N.C. film industry is also home to the CW Network’s “One Tree Hill” TV series as well as hundreds of commercial and industrial productions each year throughout the state.

> More than 800 movies have been filmed in North Carolina.  The state is well known for supporting its motion picture industry with a strong infrastructure and a bevy of locations that can stand in for sites throughout the world.  North Carolina boasts an exceptional variety of filming locations from the mountains to the coast, and a world-class film industry infrastructure. Wilmington’s EUE Screen Gems, home of the largest studio lot east of California, recently opened the largest film and television production soundstage on the East Coast.

> Gov. Perdue Announces 45 New Jobs at Sara Lee

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wedneday  announced that Sara Lee will be creating 45 new jobs at their factory in Tarboro. The new jobs come from an $11 million capital investment by Sara Lee for the addition of an equipment line to make biscuits.

> “Sara Lee’s $11 million investment in North Carolina is a testament to our state’s top-rated business climate,” said Perdue. “And because of our strong and talented workforce Sara Lee will continue to expand its operations here.”

> Sara Lee currently employees 808 people at its Tarboro factory. The Tarboro facility was just awarded “Plant of the Year” by Sara Lee. The biscuit production will add five million lbs to the 97 million lbs of food product the facility turns out every year.

Dear Honorable Gov. Perdue:

If you really want money to complete I-485 around Charlotte so the critics will stop saying the Governor did not keep her campaign promise to find the funds to complete I-485, we can help generate the funds to complete this I-485 project.

A new house was raffled in Charleston SC to benefit the Boys and Girls Club. Houses are raffled all over the world.

A bill being proposed by the NC State legislature will allow property up to $500,000 to be raffled to benefit a non profit. 

If you will ask state regulators to allow us to raffle any of the unsold new houses that builders cannot sell,

(1) house raffle proceeds will be used to pay for the I-485 completion,
(2) house raffle proceeds are no different than lottery proceeds,
(3) the public will buy house raffle tickets for a chance of winning a house,
(4) the public will buy house raffle tickets to pay for roads they can use,
(5) house raffle will help raise house prices when the winning raffle ticket is used to buy a house at retail price and that retail sale is next used as a Comparable sale by appraisers when appraising other houses.
(6) house raffle tickets of builders' unsold inventory can also be used to help pay for state budget deficits   

Please at least consider allowing us to try raffle one house as a test market.

For example, there is a $3,000,000 builder's house that the builder cannot sell and will allow us to raffle as a test.

We appraise houses for FHA and many banks, so we know builders and lenders cannot sell houses over $500,000 due to strict lending requirements.

If the Honorable Governor will allow us to raffle houses over $500,000 to pay for I-485 completion, we can help the Governor's image as being a creative Governor that is open to new ideas to help housing, help the state budget deficit and help improve roads in NC.

Sincerely,

Gene Poore

You asked for ideas for saving the state money.  Here’s one: 

Nearly every building in North Carolina is overcooled this summer.  We could save a bundle by requiring that all sites where there are state functions, set summer thermostats no cooler than 75 degrees.

Gov. Perdue on Tuesday convened the first meeting of the Budget Reform and Accountability Commission (BRAC) and launched a new Webpage, <http://brac.nc.gov>brac.nc.gov, so that citizens may make recommendations to the commission.

“As North Carolina continues to be deeply affected by this national recession, state government must ensure that every tax dollar is used as efficiently and wisely as possible,” Perdue said.  “I look forward to working with BRAC members to meet these challenges head-on, without shying away from politically tough decisions.”

Perdue established BRAC in January via <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=429>Executive Order #5 to locate and eliminate wasteful expenditures while increasing efficiency in government.

In the short term, the commission is expected to come up with ideas that can be enacted quickly to help the state save money.  Its goal will be to have recommendations in time for next year’s legislative short session.

In the long term, BRAC will examine state government and make innovative recommendations to:

• eliminate unnecessary or unsuccessful programs;
• consolidate where possible and ensure we are investing effectively and efficiently;
• and to streamline the way state government works.

Suggestions for initiatives that BRAC will consider may come from a variety of sources, including state agencies, BRAC members, and from the public at large.  The commission also urges citizens to make recommendations using the new Webpage, <http://brac.nc.gov>brac.nc.gov.

Governor Fully Restores School Lottery Funds

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced she is fully restoring funds to the lottery capital fund for public schools.

“When the national recession created a shortfall of billions of dollars, I had to turn over every stone to pay North Carolina’s bills — to pay teachers, to keep schools and other core services running,” Perdue said. “With our bills paid and the books for last fiscal year cleared out, I’m restoring the school construction lottery funds in full, which means North Carolina’s public schools will receive another $37.6 million next week.”

In February, Perdue withheld $37.6 million during the 2008-09 fiscal year from the Public School Building Capital Fund to ensure the state had sufficient resources to manage cash flow and payroll obligations. That money is being restored using funds left over from the 2008-09 fiscal year.

Gov. Perdue Signs Bill to Attract More Film Industry Jobs

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday signed Senate Bill 943 allowing production companies a 25 percent tax credit for film projects in North Carolina, up from the previous credit of 15 percent.  The bill also sets minimum spending and hiring requirements for qualifying film companies working in the state.

“This legislation will help grow our $91 million motion picture industry, preserve and create thousands of jobs and increase investments in yet another emerging economic cluster,” said Perdue. “Providing a strong foundation for North Carolina’s film industry is essential as we work to build a strong and sustainable economy through increased diversification.”

SB 943 ensures North Carolina remains a strong competitor for film production dollars, which totaled $91 million in direct spending in 2008.  The industry employs more than 2,500 statewide.  Recent major motion pictures filmed in the state include “Nights in Rodanthe,” “Leatherheads” and “The Secret Life of Bees.”  The N.C. film industry is also home to the CW Network’s “One Tree Hill” TV series as well as hundreds of commercial and industrial productions each year throughout the state.

More than 800 movies have been filmed in North Carolina.  The state is well known for supporting its motion picture industry with a strong infrastructure and a bevy of locations that can stand in for sites throughout the world.  North Carolina boasts an exceptional variety of filming locations from the mountains to the coast, and a world-class film industry infrastructure. Wilmington’s EUE Screen Gems, home of the largest studio lot east of California, recently opened the largest film and television production soundstage on the East Coast.

Gov. Perdue Announces 45 New Jobs at Sara Lee

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wedneday announced that Sara Lee will be creating 45 new jobs at their factory in Tarboro. The new jobs come from an $11 million capital investment by Sara Lee for the addition of an equipment line to make biscuits.

“Sara Lee’s $11 million investment in North Carolina is a testament to our state’s top-rated business climate,” said Perdue. “And because of our strong and talented workforce Sara Lee will continue to expand its operations here.”

Sara Lee currently employees 808 people at its Tarboro factory. The Tarboro facility was just awarded “Plant of the Year” by Sara Lee. The biscuit production will add five million lbs to the 97 million lbs of food product the facility turns out every year.

Subject: saving money idea

Comment: Hello-- I am curious about how much money the state could save by implementing energy reducing cost saving measures. For example, setting all state government building thermostats at 76 degrees in the summer and 68 in the winter. I know that every building I go into during summer months is so cold that I have to wear winter sweaters to meetings as a state employee. It just doesn't make sense to me to be spending so much money keeping building that cold. Not only would it save money, it would be an important step toward saving our environment. Thank you for your consideration.

Subject: saving money for state of NC suggestion

Comment: Governor Perdue: I suggest that during summer school sessions to have the students to ride the shorter/smaller vehicles to school for classes since the buses are no ways filled--it is a waste of fuel & energy to use the regular buses for this project. Thanks for taking my suggestion. Margaret C. Artis
