Re: SB 1007 Amend Home Inspection Licensure Laws



By: George J. Gioiella - (joy-ella) Independent Investigative Journalist



SB 1007 is seriously flawed in its origin in that it completely bypasses the duly legislated and appointed, (by the NC Assembly and Governor), North Carolina Home Inspector Licensure Board. I am not an attorney but after reviewing the outcome of the recent litigation regarding Governor Purdue attempting to circumvent the law; “A Superior Court judge last Friday ruled that, without a constitutional amendment, Perdue couldn't undermine the authority of Superintendent of Public Instruction June Atkinson by assigning oversight of the state's schools to Harrison.” Does SB1007 undermine the authority of the North Carolina Home Inspector Licensure Board?

Chapter 143, Article 9F



North Carolina Home Inspector Licensure Board





§ 143-151.43. Short title.

This Article is the Home Inspector Licensure Act and may be cited by that name.



§ 143-151.49. Powers and responsibilities of Board.

(a)  General. - The Board has the power to do all of the following:

(1)  Determine the qualifications and fitness of applicants for a new or renewed license.

(2)  Adopt and publish a code of ethics and standard of practice for persons licensed under this Article.

(3)  Issue, renew, deny, revoke, and suspend licenses under this Article.

(4)  Conduct investigations, subpoena individuals and records, and do all other things necessary and proper to discipline persons licensed under this Article and to enforce this Article.

(5)  Employ professional, clerical, investigative, or special personnel necessary to carry out the provisions of this Article.

(6)  Purchase or rent office space, equipment, and supplies necessary to carry out the provisions of this Article.

(7)  Adopt a seal by which it shall authenticate its proceedings, official records, and licenses.

(8)  Conduct administrative hearings in accordance with Article 3A of Chapter 150B of the General Statutes.

(9)  Establish fees as allowed by this Article.

(10)  Publish and make available upon request the licensure standards prescribed under this Article and all rules adopted by the Board.

(11)  Request and receive the assistance of State educational institutions or other State agencies.

(12)  Establish continuing education requirements for persons licensed under this Article.

(13)  Adopt rules necessary to implement this Article.

(b)  Exam. - In developing a licensing examination to determine the knowledge of an applicant, the Board must emphasize knowledge gained through experience.

The Board has the legislated powers elaborated above, yet Senator Hoyle; the official shill for the realtors, realtor and home builder corporate special interests, Rick Zechini, Mike Carpenter and bankrupt rogue home inspector organizations, NC ASHI’s Bruce Rudd and NCLHIA’s Fred Herndon can ignore the rule of, and existing law to promote their agenda? Rick ‘The Tower of Jelly’’ Zechini is an attorney and he ought to know that what he is selling is damaged goods. Let’s not forget NC DOI Commissioner Goodwin selling out his own Board. That ethics investigation ought to be extremely interesting.

It seems to me that we have a situation not unlike the recent Perdue debacle and SB1007 will end up in court. Please know that this journalist with the power of the Internet and cooperation of the larger media will do all in his power to stop SB1007. Knowing NC politicians’ aversion to cameras in their face, rest assured you will face many in the coming weeks. It’s about accountability and transparency in government. Regrettably, SB1007 is extremely transparent and relies, not on the greater good of the public, but on raw outdated special interest political power for its impetus.

A look at Senator Hoyle’s recent interview on WBTV News begs for him to provide supporting evidence for his statements. For the most part litigation comes about because societal expectations have not been met. The primary contact in the real estate transaction is the realtor; they establish expectations. The home inspector comes later in the process. Arguably realtor injudiciousness is usually the primary problem and home inspectors bring this to light in their report writing. Taking into account North Carolina’s ‘Joint and several liability’, of course the realtors want home inspectors to pay for their shenanigans and they want to control the inspection process,  ‘facilitate the sale’ as all of the shills for Allen Tate Company have been promoting for years.

As for Senator Hoyle’s comment that home inspectors need education, the general contactors have none before or after they obtain their license. Is there a little Pinocchio in the good Senator Hoyle? Does he have any idea what SB1007 is about or does he just rubber stamp realtor special interests? Do any of you really understand the implications of supporting SB1007? Or are you all in the pockets of special interests? Whom do you politicians represent, the corporate special interests or the good people of North Carolina? There is only one acceptable resolution to SB1007 - it needs to die, now, today! If not, I firmly believe the embarrassment and damage to the politicos involved will be costly.

Dear Senator Kinnaird,

    I applaud your efforts on SB 489 to even out criminal record points and the meeting this July 28 with House Judiciary II.    Please, Tell me how this works in a return email.  I just have spoken with Governor Perdue's counsel Edwin Speas as of two weeks ago about helping to gain me a pardon as House Bill 1328 or the law that says if the Governor pardons me for that one slap I gave my ex-husband as he was shaking me and caught my hand anyway, after he provoked me in 2002, I can get my record expunged of it.  I finally just lost my temper with righteous indignation.  I can go back to teaching school and get employed like I used to be employed without going through the third degree like I do now, just to find out they will still not hire me.  THIS HAS BEEN SO HORRIBLE ON ME and MANY OTHERS.  I sent Mr. Speas your letter to me in your just efforts to help change the expunction laws whereby I am saying all dismissals should be put in a separate file for the FBI and criminal attorneys and D.A.s, but not to be seen by prospective employers for especially victims like me with my four dismissals due to my psychopathic ex-husband's abuse on me.  I also sent them  Senator Clodfelter's letter on my behalf and past House Representative Robert Clyde Brawley.  I have also sent Allen Head at the North Carolina State Bar who heads up our new evaluation program on the judges an email about changing our expunction laws.  I know that Tim Moore, House Representative was researching expunction law changes in House Bill 88 in 2007-2008.  I do not know how many citizens suffer from such situations as mine or have multiple misdemeanor dismissals as a result of someone abusing the system, but I would like this information or statistics. 

    I have also received three letters from The White House and one personally from Michelle Obama with her hand written signature.

    North Carolina and America is coming around to bringing  justice to everyone. 

    I am very pleased you are continuing to represent the best interests of the public in the House Judiciary.

    Let me hear from you.

    With Best Regards,

Subject: House Bill 1380 and 1383. From A Concerned Carolinian.

Comment: First off, I just want to congratulate you Mrs. Purdue. I voted for you in the elections and couldn't be more proud seeing you in office. I'm one of millions of North Carolinians who believe that cannabis should be approved for medicinal purposes. North Carolinians are ready and willing to engage in a serious and objective political debate regarding the merits of legalizing the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes by adults. The time for joking is over. I would just like to know where you stand on House Bill 1380 and 1383? These bills seek to enact statewide legal protections shielding those seriously ill patients who use cannabis therapeutically with a doctor's recommendation from criminal prosecution. Thirteen states - Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington - have enacted laws protecting medical marijuana patients from state prosecution. These laws are operating primarily as lawmakers intended and have not led to widespread abuses among adolescents or adult recreational users. I believe it is unconscionable to deny this effective medicine to sick and dying patients, and I strongly urge you to support the medical use of marijuana in North Carolina and to vote 'yes' on H 1380 and H 1383.

Good evening Mr. Thomas



Several articles in the 24 July Daily News dealt with the proposal by Rep. Russell Tucker, D-Duplin,  to allow the Onslow Water and Sewer Authority (ONWASA) to inject “treated” waste water into an underground aquifer all for the purposes of saving some money.  I have questions and problems with the proposal.  Before I begin, let me say that the following is in no way intended to diminish the good standing of any Duplin County resident or Onslow County resident that lives with the area that Rep. Tucker represents.  For the record, I am not an environmental engineer, but I believe my college education, former work within the Camp Lejeune Environmental Management Department, and common sense gives me a fairly good layman’s grasp on the concept of waste water treatment, well water contamination and aquifers.  That having been said, while the aquifer issue may eventually prove detrimental to all, as it is currently described, it will primarily affect those living within, and obtaining their water from, with the borders of Onslow County.



First, why is a representative that is primarily associated with, and lives within, Duplin County, Pink Hill to be precise, initiating proposals on behalf of ONWASA when no other Onslow County legislative representatives, that lives within Onslow County, seems willing to support the initiative?  Does Duplin County have so few problems that Representative Tucker has extra time to meddle in, what is primarily, an Onslow County affair?  How does Representative Tucker benefit from representing Onslow County or more precisely, representing ONWASA?



Second, why are the ONWASA representatives so hell bent on injecting “treated” waste water into an aquifer?  Is ONWASA so cash flush that it can afford to waste $75,000 on lobbyists?  Can the subscribers to ONWASA afford to continue to support this ONWASA board initiative?  Is ONWASA so hell bent on achieving their goal, that they are willing to do so, regardless of current or future costs?  Allegations have been made that ONWASA continues to change to information that supports their decision every time there is a challenge to their data, why?  I suspect the reason is because it is harder to hit a moving target!



Third, according to all that I have read, there is absolutely no proof whatsoever that the injection of “treated” waste water into an aquifer is completely safe.  In fact, there appears to be considerable evidence to the contrary.  In a civil suit, a plaintiff must convince a jury by a preponderance of evidence before the jury will render a favorable decision.  In a criminal suit, the standard is much more stringent.  In a criminal action, the prosecution must convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt before the jury can convict.  In the case of injection of treated “waste” water into an aquifer, I feel that everyone, whether they are a customer or potential customer of ONWASA or an aquifer that ONWASA proposes to contaminate, should be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt otherwise the idea should be laid to rest!  If there is any doubt whatsoever, and there appears to be a plethora of doubt abounding,  a decision to inject should NEVER be approved.  And, if a decision is made to inject “treated” waste water into an aquifer, and that decision subsequently proves to be harmful, and that the decision was based upon ONWASA’s presentation of selective evidence or misrepresented evidence, then the issue should become, and rightfully so, the subject of a criminal investigation and the appropriate officials be held fully accountable.



All Onslow County residents, and customers of ONWASA, as well as all those individuals that obtain their water from underground aquifers have a stake in the outcome of ONWASA’s misguided proposal.  Once ONWASA begins injecting “treated” waste water into the aquifer, or any aquifer, it will be too late to change course.  Any reclaimed water obtained from an aquifer contaminated by injection of “treated” waste water, or any aquifer connected  to such a contaminated aquifer, will be reclaimed at a far greater cost than it would cost had the injection not been authorized.  And remember this folks, if small streams and creeks merge to create small rivers and small rivers merge to create large rivers, it stands to reason small aquifers merge into larger aquifers.



For the moment, common sense appears to have prevailed as the concept of the injection of “treated” waste water has been sidetracked to receive “further study”.  However, if past politics is any indication of future politics, unless there is an overwhelming public outcry of opposition to the initiative, ONWASA will merely bide its time and the politicians will grant the ONWASA request.  Who will pay the price of this deal, everyone that receives their water from an aquifer, including every ONWASA customer!

Dear Sen. Apodaca and Gov. Perdue,

With energy costs at an all time high, and an unemployment rate
of 10.9 %, energy efficiency and job creation are two of the
greatest challenges facing North Carolina today. You have the
ability to abate both of these problems through the passage of
H1389 “Finance Energy Improvements with Assessment”.

H1389 gives municipalities the ability to assist residents with
financing support for renewable energy installations and energy
efficiency improvements for residential and commercial properties.
These measures are well known to lower monthly costs for homeowners
but the upfront costs are too high for the average resident to
overcome. Municipalities could remove this hurdle with easy financing
recollected through voluntary assessments on the residents’ property.
The result is cleaner air, smaller carbon footprints and the
creation of new demand for local jobs.

As a new homeowner, I've learned that free or low cost energy
audits aren't even available from Duke Energy or anyone else
here in Hendersonville. Please support H1389 when it comes before
you.

I look forward to your reply.

Sincerely,
Larry Turk

Dear Sen. Apodaca and Gov. Perdue,

It's still a bad idea.

The natural beauty and economic value of North Carolina' s public
beaches and inlets exists today because our state leaders long
ago adopted a conservative management policy that bans the use
of hardened structures--seawalls, jetties and groins of any kind--from
our coast. I urge you to keep the state's 30 year ban on hardened
structures intact and to oppose S. 832, Coastal Resources Commission
May Permit a Terminal Groin.

The bill would allow coastal communities to avoid the state's
long-established ban on hardened structures.  These structures,
whether terminal groin or jetty, are proven to trap sand in one
area and cause a sand deficit and increased erosion rates further
down the beach.  A terminal groin established at a coastal inlet
will put public beaches down the coast at risk.

Any kind of a hardened structure project threatens to wash away
our state's landmark coastal policy banning hardened structures.
In the interest of seeking sound coastal policy based on science
that will preserve the public's beaches for the future, I urge
you to oppose SB 832.

I look forward to your reply.

Sincerely,
Larry Turk

Comment: I speak for many people in NC when I say when the time comes, please oppose bill SB585. Be sure that D or R we will remember your choices. I am a Registered D, but in recent years Morals have been lost,and our Constitution is being infringed on. Of course, if you believe in the Bible, these things must come to pass before the 2nd coming, as told in the book of Rev. Just let us all keep in mind "Where are our morals" when Jesus comes back. I know when things are going good and you have money, cars, job, fancy clothes etc.We forget about what matters most. And this is coming from a 32 yo Father of 3, who has no job, and Thank God receives Un- Employment for the time. But I know in the end, things will be awesome, but not before things get much worse. Again I say, please help protect what our God fearing Fore fathers gave to us. "FREEDOM" and that includes the right to bear arms, and the right to protect ourselves, at least the ones who can't afford body guards, and security. God Bless, and best regards. Karl Fox

As a resident of High Rock Lake in Davidson County, I support Senate Bill 967.  
In 2002, I watched in horror as Alcoa drained the lake, killing fish and other wildlife and crippling businesses.  It wasn't until pressure was applied that Alcoa requested a variance to the license to stop the draining.  But, by that point, the damage was done. 
As a citizen, I am supportive of the project being in the hands of the citizens of NC.  It would be irresponsible to allow a profit-making company to have license to the water for another 50 years!  Water will most likely become even more limited over the next 50 years.

Subject: SB1007 - YOU NEED TO KNOW NOW!!!!!



Dear Governor Purdue, members of the NC House,



As an independent investigative journalist following SB1007 since its inception I find it amazing that I continue to hear, ‘If the home builders want it (SB1007) they always get what the want.’ I cannot figure out which Lisa Martin, the Lobbyist for the home builders possess more of arrogance or temerity.



The question is what do you, the representatives of the good folks of North Carolina possess, or should the question be who possesses you? Do you represent the people or just blindly vote for whatever supercilious lobbyists like Lisa’s Martin promote? By now you all should know that Rick Zechini and Lisa Martin have not been forthright or flexible in their dealings with the North Carolina Home Inspector Licensure Board, the body duly legislated and empowered to protect the welfare of the public regarding home inspection matters. They seek to take it over to protect their own interest’s pocket books to facilitate sales at the expense of the public. Should the foxes, realtors and home builders, be guarding the chicken house?



As for Bruce Rudd of NC-ASHI and Fred Herndon of NCLHIA, two flat broke organizations; their arrogance may only be exceeded by their ignorance. They are traitors to the few members they have and the public. Read on to find out more and why.



SB1007 does not protect the safety and welfare of the public. What is does is benefit the folks outlined below and their agenda. Know that if you support this legislation you will be held accountable come Election Day! A reliable source confirms that next week an ethics complaint will be filed against NCDOI Commissioner Goodwin for his favoring the corporate special interests of the realtors and home builders above the home inspector licensing board, which is under his jurisdiction, and denying the public leadership and protection they are entitled to from the licensing board. Goodwin, Zechini and Martin have to be charter members of the House of the Rising Sun.



For a better understanding of SB1007 please read the entire letter included in the email.

NC-$ASHI’s Bruce Rudd quoting events regarding Lisa Martin:



“Lisa Martin of NCHBA was in attendance for what turned out to be the sole purpose of informing the group that if proposed legislation went forward with language closing the G.C. back door, then it would be quickly killed by the NCHBA.  After her statement and with little discussion she left the meeting.  Within one hour of her departure the proposed legislation crafted by the Licensing Board, which also closed the G.C. back door, died at the Department of Insurance.  Was that a coincidence? – We didn’t think so.”

      MEMO



            DATE:            05-15-09         



                TO: NC-ASHI Board of Directors      



          FROM: Bruce Rudd, NCAR Liaison       



 SUBJECT:        SUMMARY REPORT, RE:

Home Inspection Legislative Initiative (S.B. 1007)

………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………





My efforts along with John Guy, our Chapter President, toward negotiating effective legislative changes for the NC Home Inspection industry with representatives from other affected trade organizations is now basically complete.  The proposed legislation is now in the hands of our State congress and out of our hands. Due to the heavy impact on our Chapter’s delicate budget, we are attempting to curtail additional expenses from Lobbying costs.   My only remaining work will be to answer questions and consult as needed.



This has been a unique, complicated, and very educational learning experience for me; and one that should be accurately documented for the benefit of the Chapter and for future negotiators.  For that reason, I will walk you through the process from beginning to present, including the logic, strategy, reasoning, and conclusions involved.  I apologize in advance for the necessary length of this report.



HISTORY



                        On 02-05-09 Rick Zechini, Director of Governmental Affairs-NCAR, approached us and the NCLHIA through our respective lobbyists to request a meeting of all parties to discuss language that the NCAR wanted to see added to the H.I. Statutes.  He had also invited Lisa Martin, NCHBA Representative, and encouraged all parties to bring any proposals that they may have as well.  John Guy and I were designated to represent NC-ASHI and we began by instead trying to get direct meetings (without the lawyers) for two reasons: first to force direct recognition of our organization by NCAR, and second to avoid the cost of our lobbyist at a time when our treasury was weak.  Fortunately, we failed in that attempt when all the other parties argued strongly in favor of the inclusion of Henry Jones (our lobbyist) because of his unique historical perspective gained from writing the original legislation and his impressive reasoning and negotiating skills.  We agreed to include Henry who turned out to be an invaluable asset both for the above reasons and because all meetings were subsequently held at Henry’s offices, giving us a comfortable historical and home field advantage.  Lengthy group meetings were conducted on March 5, 12, and 19, 2009 lasting in total over 12 hours.





THE MEETINGS



            NCLHIA sent Fred Herndon, Bob Scott and Gary Walker represented by Thomas Moore.  NCAR was represented by their Rick Zechini and Cady Thomas.  NCHBA was represented by their Lisa Martin who attended part of the first meeting only. NC-ASHI sent John Guy and me represented by Henry Jones.  Each meeting began with a draft legislation proposal for consideration by the group with the second and third proposals very accurately rewritten based on agreements reached in the preceding meeting, primarily by Cady Thomas.  By suggestion of Rick Zechini and agreement of all parties it was decided that group working papers (the draft proposals) should not be distributed to the various memberships because they could be easily misconstrued without the context of the discussions.  Rather, general meeting summaries would be a more prudent alternative.  All parties further agreed to respect the existing stated purpose of the H.I. legislation which is to protect the public, and to negotiate accordingly.  In my opinion, all parties did just that, with the possible exception of NCHBA.  I asked Rick Zechini directly what NCAR’s intentions were.  He informed the group that NCAR would, in any case, introduce proposed H.I. legislation this congressional session.  He went on to say that the NCAR preference was to first obtain consensus on the legislation from the related Associations.



NC-ASHI STRATEGY



            John and I (with input from the Board of Directors) carefully evaluated the possible outcomes of the meetings with the goal of identifying the favorable outcomes for NC-ASHI and then planning our participation to achieve those favorable outcomes.  We first agreed that NCAR should be encouraged and if possible rewarded for their first ever attempt to consult with us prior to taking actions that impact us.  Second, we acknowledged that legislation would be introduced with or without our input and that we would have little or no control of it once it reached the legislature.  Therefore, the prudent action was to try to construct the most palatable proposal possible and then to support it in hopes that widespread support would be the best defense against tampering while in the legislature.  Third, we agreed that, even though we would have little control of the legislation, we should capitalize on the face to face opportunity to exhibit to the NCAR the differences in education and experience between the Home Inspector trade associations.  All of these goals were dependant on first determining what grievances (real or perceived) were motivating NCAR to involve itself in the Statutes of a different profession.  It should be noted that the alternative of opposing the legislative changes was also considered and discarded for several reasons, the most compelling of which was the need to put our differences with NCAR to bed for the simple reason that we can’t afford the cost to our treasury of continuing to fight with them.  We also acknowledged that the comparative stature of our membership would allow us to be more accepting of their proposals than the NCLHIA, so that if obstruction became necessary then that task would be handled by them.





NCAR GRIEVANCES



            Let me preface this section by saying that we concluded that it didn’t matter if the complaints were significant or not.  It only mattered that the NCAR believed that they were.  We have spent years trying to convince them by surveys and statistics that they don’t really have significant complaints – just anecdotes.  Those efforts have always and will always fall on deaf ears so are not worth pursuing.  It is necessary to deal with their perceived problems without addressing the validity.



Through some pretty persistent questioning, John and I tried to determine what the NCAR complaints were.  We could tell that their initial draft proposal was trying to address specific issues, but their attempts were clumsy and in some cases detrimental.  We thought that by knowing their goals we could find more acceptable ways to accomplish them.  Their first and primary complaint was Realtors® being held responsible for the actions of Home Inspectors (damage and/or mistakes) because the inspectors either couldn’t or wouldn’t be responsible for themselves.  We found that to be a very legitimate concern.  Second, they believed that if the summary page could be more prescriptive, then unnecessary confusion and ill-defined but alarming complications could be avoided.  We found no fault with that goal either, provided inspectors could tell their clients what they considered to be the important things (regardless of category) on the summary page.  Third, they wanted inspections to be more consistent from inspector to inspector (commonality in what most inspectors considered to be significant), and wanted better and more uniform inspector education to accomplish that goal.  We recognized that this was the actual intention of their push for standard report forms, and that education was a much more attractive and meaningful method of achieving the goal than was standard report forms.  For that reason, we also considered this to be a worthwhile goal.  And fourth, they (and even more so the NCHBA) had complaints about the vague nature of inspectors calling Code.  Although we didn’t want to give up that option for home inspectors, we did agree that the option should be used responsibly.



These were the four main issues.  As you review the resulting proposed legislation, you will note that virtually all changes address these four topics.  There are other minor changes which we considered to be primarily “housekeeping”.  We examined each of them for the possibility of an unexpected negative impact, and found none.  It is necessary to examine each of the four main issues to understand the consequent development of S.B. 1007.



#1 HOME INSPECTOR RESPONSIBILITY



            The legislative proposals to address this issue are primarily found in 143-151.51(b).  The initial NCAR draft from the first meeting addressed this concern by requiring $25,000. – $50,000. In a surety bond and by forbidding a limit of liability statement in the pre-inspection contract.  The H.I. associations pointed out that there is no such bond available, that the amounts were inconsistent with other trades (i.e. $17,500 for G.C.’s), and that most E & O carriers require a limit of liability statement.  We acknowledged the need for increased responsibility requirements since the current $5,000 - $10,000 requirement was woefully lacking, and we acknowledged the sensitivity of the legislature to requirements that could appear to be barriers to entry of the profession.  We suggested as an alternative, general



liability insurance because of its reasonable cost, its established precedent in six surrounding states, and its inherent protection of both buyers and sellers (the public).  This took care of damage and injury concerns but we agreed that the NCAR still needed some additional responsibility protection from home inspectors designed to cover mistakes and oversights.  We were hesitant to require E. & O. insurance because of its expense, so we made it one of three options including either net assets or a bond.  With this two part requirement, home inspectors would be fairly proven to be responsible for their actions, and no barrier to entry would be created.



#2 SUMMARY PAGE



            The legislative proposals to address this concern are found primarily at 143-151.58(a1).  This one was difficult and is easily misunderstood.  The difficulty was not the result of disagreement of the parties as much as the need for very careful language to serve the purpose while protecting home inspectors.  Resolution of this issue actually continued in good faith beyond the meetings and the introduction of the bill, which unfortunately resulted in the incorrect assumption by many that there was tampering.    The core of the NCAR complaint was that the “adversely affects the habitability” wording in the Board Rule gave carte blanche to inspectors to include anything they wanted to in the summary, so their first draft proposal eliminated that language.  Also, (and this is the part that came up later) they wondered if the language concerning further evaluation could be tightened up to be more prescriptive and defined.  We agreed that the “adversely affects the habitability” language was excessively vague and impossible to define; but we pointed out that it was a home inspector’s only pathway to present important (although not necessarily defective) safety information to our clients.  We agreed that the vague language could be eliminated as long as another pathway was provided for this important consumer information.  NCAR showed immediate understanding of the issue and agreed that they also wanted this type of information included in the summary.  They suggested an additional summary page item worded, “(shall include) any system or component that endangers the safety of the inhabitants.”  We appreciated but rejected their offer based on the fact that home inspectors are liable not only for what is on the summary page but also for whatever is not on the summary page.  Their well intentioned proposed language could make an inspector responsible for reporting every possible safety improvement available.  For that reason and at our request, the language was changed to, “may also describe any system or component that poses a safety concern.”  The vague language, ‘adversely affects the habitability of the dwelling” was eliminated to the benefit of all.

            After the meetings and introduction of the legislation, Rick Zechini reviewed the package in light of NCAR’s desire to make the summary page more prescriptive.  He recognized that the “further investigate” language could also be easily misused as a catch all for inspectors who were unsure about an issue for no good reason or who used the language as a general C.Y.A. dump.  He did not change the proposed legislation; rather he contacted us and NCLHIA for opinions and suggestions on the issue.  We recognized both that the language could be and is sometimes abused, and that such language was necessary because of home inspectors limitations from being generalists and limitations of access, weather conditions, and non-destructive techniques.  The question then was, what do legitimate uses of the language have in common?  The answer we came to was that legitimate use depended on the home inspector observing something suspicious but not confirmable under his constraints.  For that reason, I suggested, “some documented visible evidence” as the needed qualifier to keep the option while preventing abuse.  My suggestion was adopted and then the proposed legislation was changed.  Again, it is important to remember that inspectors can be held responsible for summary page deletions as well as inclusions, so the prescriptive approach desired by NCAR is actually also protection for the home inspector.



#3 EDUCATION



            The legislative proposals to address this concern are found primarily at 143-152.51 (a)(5) & (c).  The NCAR concern here was the disparity from inspector to inspector about what issues were significant.  It resulted in no uniformity or method for them to anticipate the issues that they would ultimately have to address.  They had previously and incorrectly attempted to deal with this concern by pushing for standardized report forms, not realizing that they were attacking the only real sacred cow of the inspection industry.  They finally realized that the alternative method of relieving this concern was more comprehensive and uniform education of home inspectors.  To facilitate that, they merely needed to incorporate the Licensing Board’s own educational initiative, which they did.  Surprisingly, the abbreviated education program for existing home inspectors was not NCAR’s idea – it was mine.  We agreed that home inspector education was spotty at best, with all of us historically hustling whatever knowledge we could from diverse sources.  We also agreed that the associate program was not a viable alternative for entry into the profession, although it was the only alternative to a G.C.  I don’t think that anyone disagrees that uniform and comprehensive education for home inspectors is a good thing for the industry.  ASHI National has developed a model State home inspection legislative program which includes a grandfather clause.  The NC-ASHI membership can easily meet the grandfathering requirements, so imposing education requirements for existing home inspectors does not impose a hardship on NC-ASHI members, the group I represented.  For this reason, I explained that addressing the educational needs of new inspectors was important, but it did not address the group (existing home inspectors) that would influence home inspections for the next several years.  For any kind of short term relief, uniform and comprehensive education would be needed for existing home inspectors – hence, the abbreviated education program. Details of the grandfathering requirements were debated and ended up more stringent than I originally proposed, but still very achievable for the average ASHI member.



#4 CODE



            NCAR and even more so NCHBA had serious concerns with Home Inspectors calling things Code issues in reports.  NCHBA went so far as to state that even their own members (G.C.’s) were not entitled to determine Code issues – only Code enforcement officials.  We, and more emphatically NCLHIA, did not want to give up home inspector’s ability to call Code issues, although we all agreed that it was a bad idea for an inspector to do so.  I proposed the language from the S.C. home inspector legislation which allows inspectors to call code, but also imposes specific responsibilities to be accurate if they do so.  Everyone agreed and the change is at 143-158.(a2).

MISCELLANEOUS



            There are some other minor changes to the statutes in the proposed legislation – some insignificant and some helpful.  In fairness, language was added to allow current associate licensees the option of finishing the associate program or switching to the new pre-licensing education program.  More specific language and stronger requirements were added for inactive licensees to return to active status.  Language was added to require licensees to report felony and misdemeanor convictions to the Licensing Board.  When it was discovered that some people sat for the licensing exam every time it was offered but never passed, language was added to prevent taking the exam more than twice per year.  Licensees entering the profession through the Contractor, Engineer, or Architect method would have to remain “in good standing” in their entry profession.  In other words, they could not drop their entry profession licensing after achieving their home inspector license.  And those entering by the above method have to wait six months between their two licenses.  The requirement to be a high school graduate is currently deleted; however, it is not clear whether that is an intentional deletion or a typographical error.  In either case, a high school diploma is highly irrelevant to the skills needed of a home inspector with the possible exception of writing skills, so we do not consider it to be an important issue.



GENERAL CONTRACTOR EXCEPTION



            This is an issue which is inadequately repaired by the proposed legislation, and one which has become the focus of much attention.  A discussion of it is needed to understand why this needed repair is so lacking.  The original draft proposal for the first meeting written entirely by NCAR firmly closed the G.C. back door, clearly indicating that they wanted it closed as did we.  Lisa Martin of NCHBA was in attendance for what turned out to be the sole purpose of informing the group that if proposed legislation went forward with language closing the G.C. back door, then it would be quickly killed by the NCHBA.  After her statement and with little discussion she left the meeting.  Within one hour of her departure the proposed legislation crafted by the Licensing Board, which also closed the G.C. back door, died at the Department of Insurance.  Was that a coincidence? – We didn’t think so.   All negotiating parties believed that the NCHBA had the power and ability to do what they said.  The questions then were why did they resist so strongly and were they really that powerful?  As best I could determine, their resistance resulted from precedent.  They had apparently never allowed any legislation to go forward which indicated that a G.C. was not qualified to do anything.  Also, they liked the commonly used language that lumped them in the company of engineers and architects and did not want to be treated separately from them, as this proposal did.  I discussed the power issue with Henry Jones because, contrary to my belief, NCHBA appeared to be more powerful than NCAR.  Henry explained that power came from more that one source, and could result from money or image.  NCAR was probably the most powerful in terms of money, but that was trumped by the NCHBA image.  According to Henry, NCHBA has always been successful at portraying themselves as the epitome of the honest, hard working, blue collar guy in a pick-up truck – an image the legislature will not mess with!  Proof of their power was provided by

NCAR who, even though they wanted the back door closed, would not challenge the NCHBA.  The only concession offered  by NCHBA was the “in good standing” language, and then much later Henry, through his skilled negotiating, got the six month waiting period from Mike Carpenter who is apparently Lisa Martin’s boss. 



The group was faced with going forward without proper resolution of the back door issue or closing the back door at the likely risk of the entire project.  We (John & I) decided to go forward for several reasons:  Statistics from the Licensing Board indicated that about 66% of home inspectors entered the profession through the G.C. back door, but that group accounted for only 40% of complaints – no evidence of detriment to the public.  We reviewed the roster of candidates for the next Licensing Board exam and found that, although 17 of 19 were entering by the G.C. back door, only two had recent G.C. licenses which would indicate intentionally getting a G.C. for the purpose of entering the home inspection profession.  We considered that current lack of a viable alternative to enter the profession may well have forced many to enter through the G.C. method, and that the viable pre-licensing education program in the proposed legislation would provide a good alternative.  Our thought, supported by our own experience, was that even if the G.C. alternative was easier, it did not prepare a new licensee to perform a home inspection while the new education program would.  The fact is that all new licensees want to have a successful business which means they must perform a first inspection in front of a first client and therefore have to know how.  It is possible in our opinion that the G.C. back door could very well close itself in light of the new education option.  Our other compelling reason was the wise council of Henry Jones who said, “don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”



CONCLUSIONS



            The above fully describes, as well as my memory and notes are able, how the proposed legislation reached its current place and what it contains and why.  The bottom line is that it is a thoughtful, carefully prepared document which answers many of the legitimate concerns of the NCAR while at the same time providing additional protections for home inspectors.  Most important of all, it serves the public by providing them with better educated and more responsible Home Inspectors.  The differences it creates for a competent, responsible home inspector will be so negligible as to be hardly noticed.  So my conclusions have more to do with the parties and the climate than with the actual mild and inoffensive legislation proposal.



NCAR



            Rick Zechini and Cady Thomas proved to be honest, skilled, understanding, and reasonable negotiators who indicated throughout a sincere concern for the welfare of the public.  There was never a single case of either of them changing or altering anything in the proposal without first discussing it with the group, and there is nothing in the legislation upon which we did not agree.  I developed a firm respect for them both.  Many will tell you and have told me that they simply conned us.  You all know me and I flatly say that didn’t happen.  Decide for yourselves.  The most disappointing thing about the whole project to me as a person is the grossly unfair way that Rick Zechini has been constantly attacked from many directions for being sneaky or conniving over parts of the legislation that weren’t his to begin with – they were mine.  We do not need to fear NCAR, but we do need to keep good communications open with them.  Remember, they don’t understand that harmful and disruptive voices like George Gioiella are as offensive to us as to them, unless we tell them.





NCHBA



            We all wish that NCHBA was more public minded and less personally minded, but they are not and clearly no one can make them change.  They narrowly see their job as protection of their members and that’s what they do.  On the other hand, their minor concessions ( in good standing, six month waiting period) indicate a less than totally closed mind.  In addition to the concessions, Fred Herndon has commitments from both NCHBA and NCAR to work with us on further changes if time and experience show more changes to be necessary.  So although we can’t make NCHBA change and certainly not on our time table, we can expect to be able to reason with them over time.  For me, that’s good enough for now.



NCLHIA



            Under the reasonable and patient leadership of Fred Herndon, the NCLHIA proved to be a valuable negotiating partner.  They approached the table differently than did we.  John and I cleared our objectives and plans with our Board prior to the meetings in order to be able to act on the spot.  NCLHIA on the other had planned to gather information to take back for internal discussions prior to action.  I’m sure our quickness to act was as aggravating to them as their hesitation to act was to us.  In the overall process it really made no difference.  NCLHIA has been much more active in the necessary but tedious follow up work than have we, and I thank them for that as well.  Both their lobbyist and ours told us in no uncertain terms how patently stupid it is in their opinion for our two organizations to present a divided front for our industry.  I think that issue bears additional and serious study.



LICENSING BOARD



            This group, although not involved in the direct negotiations, was the most disappointing to me of all.  I honestly don’t know why.  We carefully kept them abreast of the negotiations throughout the process and since none of the negotiators was ever asked to appear before them to offer additional explanations, we thought that was sufficient.  In light of the failure of their own legislative proposal, we thought they would appreciate a second chance to get their pre-education program.  The best way I can describe their behavior throughout the process is very inconsistent – much like a Whack-A-Mole game at the fair.  I became aware during the process that frustration with such behavior on previous occasions was the motivation for Rick Zechini taking this different approach with us.  I won’t speculate here on the reasons for their behavior, but I do conclude that carefully worded legislation is much safer for home inspectors than is reliance on Rules of the Board.  In fairness to the negotiating team I would point out that wording in the abbreviated education program grandfathering clause was reworked several times for the sole purpose of alleviating administrative load on the Licensing Board.



HENRY JONES



            John and I almost made a very serious mistake early on when we tried to avoid using Henry.  His skill and knowledge were invaluable.  We would have been totally lost without him.  My advice to you, the Board, is to always budget for the contingency of needing Henry because there will be times when he is essential.







SUMMARY



            This concludes my report on the proposed legislation.  I would like to thank the Board of Directors for allowing me to participate on behalf of NC-ASHI.  It has been an amazing learning experience for me.  My parting comments have more to do with society than with the proposed legislation.  The strong and widespread objections to it are very puzzling to me.  The legislation is so innocuous that I don’t understand the ability of so many to get overly excited by it.  It just isn’t that big a deal!  The other and even more amazing phenomenon to me is the propensity of so many to misunderstand or misconstrue the language and then to immediately conclude that the whole thing is a deceptive trick designed to cheat them in some way.  Why is it so much easier and more natural to assume deceit and deception than to seek clarification and understanding?  It could be a comment on society.







Best Regards,

Subject: Vote no on SB461 NC Racial Justice Act

Comment: Governor Perdue, SB461 NC Racial Justice Act is a very poorly thought out piece of legislation which will cause inordinate chaos in the NC court system, much pain to people who are looking for justice and increase court costs for the state. Any murder case should be tried solely on the facts that apply to the act in question. There should NEVER be extraneous factors introduced into a case that requires sentencing. There are already laws that forbid discrimination on the basis of race,gender and sex and, if these laws are properly enforced, there is no need for this bill to become law. This bill will eliminate justice from the courtroom when capital murder is the crime. Statistics can be used to conform to ANY viewpoint and should NEVER be introduced into the courtroom. If supporters of this bill truly want justice, they should support education initiatives that target underserved populations so that opportunities are presented which can eliminate the frustrstions that cause so many people to turn to crime. Please think twice and reject this piece of legislation as harmful to the citizens of this state. Respectfully , Ilona Kusa

I join the ad hoc alliance of health freedom advocates, consumer groups, and family farm, home and natural food producers, stating: "We reject all forms of food dictatorship. "We oppose all deceptive attempts to industrialize the food supply under the guise of "food safety." Current bills before Congress such as HR 2749, HR875, S425, HR759, etc., lack any producer protective language patterned after Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 USCsec 203(s)(2) and DSHEA protective language of the 2007 FDA act, Section 1011. "They are unacceptable to the members of a free society and must be defeated. "Government or corporate entities must not infringe on a citizen's land, their right to own, produce, sell, or use food, seeds or healing substances ... , nor should any threat of war, emergency, or disease be used to abrogate or limit these rights." I ask my elected officials to act accordingly.

Subject: Senate Bill 375/House Bill 589

Comment: Good Afternoon, I was excited and encouraged to hear about Senate Bill 375/House Bill 589. This bill would require health benefit plan coverage for hearing aids for children with hearing loss, birth through age 21, up to $2,500 per ear every 36 months. We know that the most important development of a young child occurs in the first few years of life, and our obligation to the child does not end there. Our state priorities need to reflect that knowledge. Thirteen other states have passed legislation requiring insurance coverage for hearing aids for children. I am a parent of two hearing impaired daughters, ages 15 and 13, who have a sever to profound hearing loss since birth. The cost to our family over the years has been huge. Hearing aids cost between $3,000 and $6,000 or more. In addition, just like glasses, hearing aids need to be replaced or changed over time as a child's hearing changes. The legislation can ultimately save our community dollars and at only $.39 estimated annual insurance premium increases per insured NC citizen. I strongly urge you to support this important legislation. Investing in the early years saves us all money later on. I would appreciate a written reply that states how you voted on this issue. Thank you for your time and consideration and your support of the deaf and hard of hearing. Sincerly, Sheila Galloway

	Once again, please take another look at Senate Bill 460.  This Bill will hurt many North Carolinians and will cost the State money that is not there.  If this Bill passes there will be many financially affected and we don't need more unemployed.  The American Kennel Club is housed in Raleigh and would be greatly appreciative if you personally would speak with them.  The AKC could help look at ways of controlling aggressive animals and look at positive ways to look at the population of pets and ownership.   Thank you again.

> Gov. Perdue Blocks Proposal to Hike Income Tax on Working Families

On Thursday, Gov. Perdue announced her opposition to a proposed budget deal between the House and Senate. 

> "I will not support a budget that is balanced on the backs of working families and that does not protect our public schools," said Gov. Perdue.

> The legislative budget proposal included an income tax surcharge on all taxpayers and did not do what is necessary to protect public education.  Gov. Perdue called on the House and Senate to work together quickly to pass a budget that protects public education and core services without being balanced on the backs of working families.

> Governor Signs Executive Order to Restrict Spending, Ensure Balanced Budget

Gov. Bev Perdue today signed <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=536> Executive Order 20, restricting state spending to ensure a balanced budget while legislators work to finalize a budget for the 2009-10 fiscal year.

> â€œUntil a budget is signed, this order will ensure that North Carolina maintains a balanced budget and that state agencies continue to follow the strict spending guidelines in place during the previous fiscal year,â€ Gov. Perdue said.

> The executive order directs the Office of State Budget and Management (OSBM) to prioritize spending on mandatory obligations and to restrict state agency spending on travel and purchase orders for goods and services. It also restricts agency spending to fill vacant positions.

> To protect the stateâ€™s core responsibilities in education and public safety, the order allows OSBM to make exceptions for direct expenses for classroom instruction and emergency situations related to law enforcement, health care and public safety.

> The order rescinds the governorâ€™s previous executive order to restrict spending for the 2008-09 fiscal year.

> Continental Teves to Add 338 Jobs in Fletcher

Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday announced brake systems and components manufacturer Continental Teves will expand its operations in Henderson County.  The company, a wholly owned subsidiary of global automotive supplier Continental, plans to invest $30.1 million and create 338 jobs in Fletcher during the next five years.

> â€œNorth Carolina ranks 10th nationally in automotive-related jobs thanks to the commitment of such international leaders as Continental and its subsidiary in our state,â€ Gov. Perdue said. â€œEstablished companies continue to grow here because they know the value of our top business climate and skilled workforce.â€

> Continental has its North American headquarters in Michigan and operates two facilities in North Carolina. The Fletcher manufacturing plant currently employs 288 workers, while a plant in Morganton has 367 employees. The overall average wage for the 338 new jobs in Fletcher is expected to be $36,179, not counting benefits, which is higher than the Henderson County average of $31,252.

> North Carolina continues to have a top-ranked business climate.  Through Gov. Perdueâ€™s JobsNOW initiative, the state will work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain our workforce and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

> For more information about Continental Teves or Continental, visit <http://www.conti-online.com>www.conti-online.com.  For information about employment opportunities at the Fletcher manufacturing plant, call the Henderson County office of the N.C.

> Gov. Perdue Announces Second Round of Drinking Water and Wastewater Recovery Projects

Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday  announced a total of $45.2 million in drinking water, stormwater and wastewater projects in a second round of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) awards.  In total, 40 communities in 31 counties received second-round funding.  More than half of the second-round projects were identified as â€œgreenâ€ projects.

> â€œThese JobsNOW Recovery projects will create jobs, boost the economy, improve the stateâ€™s infrastructure and protect North Carolinaâ€™s drinking water and other water systems in the future,â€ said Perdue.

> Nearly $23.9 million in recovery funds will be distributed by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to 28 communities for public water supply projects.  New Hanover County, Jacksonville and Cary were each awarded $3 million, the maximum amount allowed by the ARRA program.  The full list of second-round drinking water award recipients is now available at: <http://www.deh.enr.state.nc.us/pws/recovery.htm>www.deh.enr.state.nc.us/pws/recovery.htm.  In April, $40.3 million in drinking water funds were awarded to 35 local systems in the initial round of projects.

> In addition, awards totaling $21.3 million will go to 12 communities for wastewater and stormwater projects.  Southport, Burgaw, Brunswick County and Buncombe County received the $3 million maximum allowed under ARRA.  The full list of second-round stormwater and wastewater award recipients is available at: <http://www.nccgl.net/Stimulus.html>www.nccgl.net/Stimulus.html.  In April, $45.8 million were awarded to 36 communities for stormwater and wastewater projects.

bcc: Press

The following communique was issued to members of B.O.L.T. of NC, which I am director of, and the many independent bikers we are in contact with. I urge all Senators to vote no on Senate Bill 64, Motorcycle Learners Permits. How you vote on this bill at this crucial time will be published and widely distributed during the 2010 election season.


Senate Bill 64 Motorcycle Learners Permits, sponsored by Senator Harry Brown, and driven through the House by Rep. Faison, with the Folwell Amendment adopted within the House chambers, passed the House this afternoon, with 33 house members opposed. Since the bill was amended in the House, it now returns to the Senate for concurrence.

I will continue to oppose the bill as being not equitable for those who choose to operate motorcycles rather than automobiles. This bill provides a foot in the door for those who want mandatory safety courses at great cost to individuals under 18 years old. I say again, neither the AMA nor NC CBA/ABATE is authorized to speak for me or conduct negotiations on my behalf.

Thanks to all who voiced their opposition to Senate Bill 64, and thank you to the legislators who listened to the many motorcyclists and their various perspectives. Dale Folwell, in a spirit of bi-partisan and cross-chambers cooperation, did excellent by motorcyclists, by seeking a compromise bill that removed or alleviated some of the worst provisions, but in the end we are still left with a bad bill that forces mandates against motorcyclists which are not imposed upon those who operate other motor vehicles. As I advised many legislators, a bad bill is still a bad bill, regardless of any compromises agreed upon by a few people, and should be voted against. I am encouraged that many legislators listened to us.

At this time, I do not anticipate issuing a call to action within the motorcycling community which I am a part of, but will contact all Senators to voice my personal objections. Others who disagree with the bill are encouraged to understand that there is still an opportunity to stop this bill in the Senate, and when it reaches the Governors desk.

Yours, in liberty,

I would like to take the time to say I am very much pro HB1360.  These are non violent habitual offenders.  Many of them get more time than the violent habitual offenders, which absolutely makes no sense to me.  If you had the choice to live beside an axe murderer or someone who might steal your lawn mower when you're not home, which would you choose?  Granted, taking a lawn mower is not law abiding.  I would much rather have that person as a neighbor than many other violent offenders.  Allowing HB 1360 to be passed opens up thousands and thousands of dollars that the state of NC needs.  It is ludicrist to pay to keep these petty offenders in prison for years and years and years while the state of NC goes broke.  Most petty offenders are harmless to human life.  Yet it seems, those are the ones we want to lock up and throw away the key.  Serious offenders seem to walk away time and time again with very little.  The habitual felon charge truly confuses me when the terms "fair sentencing" is applied.  It is left to the DA's discretion.  After researching , by sitting in a court room, looking up records of offenders, I find that if the DA doesn't have a grudge against someone they are not given an Habitual Felon charge, or if they have a high powered attorney.  I, also, noticed that some recieved HF charge while others whose records were much worse did not.  The law cannot be inforced without regulation.  Leaving it up to the discretion of a human individual leaves much room for "dislike" (etc...) to cloud one's sense of judgement.  No one can prove this charge to be handed out "fairly", for it is not!  PASS THE BILL AND ALLOW NC TO HAVE MONEY TO PUT IN EDUCATION.

Bill 920 is overcompensating and needs to be tightened up a bit more. Our legal system frowns on warrantless searches, abuses will occur.

	<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/>


Gov. Perdue's Probabtion Reforms to Improve Public Safety

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced significant reforms to the probation system that will speed the process of obtaining warrants for parole commission violators and put more information into the hands of law enforcement officers on the streets.
These reforms include the following changes:
- The Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission will respond to requests for warrants within 24 hours;
- Probation officers will receive a response to a violation report within that same 24 hours;
- If a warrant is issued it will be entered into the DCI network immediately; and
- Law enforcement officers across North Carolina will have immediate access to information about probationers and prison inmates on their vehicle computers whenever a license check is conducted.
In addition, the governor signed Senate Bill 920, her proposal to:
- Allow probation officers the authority to perform warrantless searches on supervised probationers;
- Give law enforcement officers the ability to perform warrantless searches if they have reasonable suspicion that the probationer is engaged in criminal activity or possesses a weapon without written court permission;
- Allow probation officers limited access to juvenile criminal records, providing them with better insight into the risks offenders pose;
“With these changes, law enforcement and probation officers will have immediate access to probation information and will be better prepared to protect themselves and their communities,” Perdue said. “These reforms will strengthen our probation system and make our communities safer.
“This kind of access to information is crucial for the safety of our officers, our law enforcement partners and the public,” said Correction Secretary Alvin Keller.  “No longer will probation violators be able to hide from the system.”
Also, Governor Perdue announced that information from the Department of Correction offender database of more than 1.1 million criminal offenders is being shared with the law enforcement community via the DCI network.
Since the computer system for law enforcement vehicles was activated on June 24, officers have entered roughly 128,000 queries, and 1,146 probation absconders have been arrested.
Gov. Perdue Signs Bill Establishing Stricter Safety Oversight of Coal Ash Ponds

Gov. Perdue today signed Senate Bill 1004, increasing the safety oversight of coal ash ponds in North Carolina. The legislation subjects dams that create coal ash ponds to direct inspection by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources. 
“Because of potential risk posed by the location of North Carolina’s coal ash ponds, we must provide greater oversight and more frequent inspections,” said Gov. Perdue. “This legislation will keep our citizens safer and our dams more secure.”
In June, the Environmental Protection Agency released a list of 44 “high-hazard” coal ash waste dams across the county. Twelve of these dams were located in North Carolina, more than any other state. A “high hazard” designation was created in the 1980’s for coal ash impoundments and other similar dams that are near densely populated areas, downstream water supplies, important public utilities or primary highways because of the potential impact of a dam’s failure.  The designation does not reflect the structural condition of the dam. 
Currently, power companies are only required to file reports every five years by private engineers on the structural conditions of the dams.  The reports are filed with the N.C. Utilities Commission and the impoundments are exempt from regulation under the N.C. Dam Safety Act.
This legislation, sponsored by Sen. David Hoyle (D-Guilford) and led by Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) in the House, places coal ash dams and ponds under the regulation of the Dam Safety Act. This means the structures will be more closely regulated, and requires a state inspection every two years. 
15 Contracts Totaling More Than $29 Million Awarded for Highway Projects Across NC

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced that 15 contracts totaling $29.3 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including seven projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The contracts were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.
“These projects will stimulate economic growth by creating and maintaining jobs as we enhance safety and keep our people traveling,” Perdue said.
According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.

NC Submits Grant Application for Economic Recovery Funding for I-85 Improvement Project

North Carolina has submitted a grant application for $300 million in discretionary grant money included in the ARRA to use for the I-85 Corridor Improvement Project, which includes replacing the I-85 bridge over the Yadkin River, in Davidson and Rowan counties. Comprehensive information about the project is available on a new Web site, <http://www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/>www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/.
“Replacing this bridge is critical to preserving safety, travel and commerce along this vital interstate route and is an ideal candidate for recovery funding,” Perdue said. “These improvements are essential to ensuring that I-85 continues to move people and goods safely and effectively on a regional, statewide and national level.”
Perdue has been working with Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and North Carolina’s congressional delegation to obtain funding for the project. It also has received tremendous support from local communities and business leaders advocating for the project. Nearly 100 letters and resolutions of endorsement have been received to date and can be viewed on the project Web site.
The I-85 Corridor Improvement Project will complete a comprehensive overhaul of the highway, bridge and rail infrastructure located along 6.8 miles of I-85 from north of Long Ferry Road (Exit 81) in Rowan County to U.S. 29-52-70/I-85 Business (Exit 87) in Davidson County. The project would be completed under two design-build contracts, which allow project teams of designers and contractors to conduct design and construction work simultaneously to expedite completion, at an estimated cost of more than $300 million.
I-85 is the most direct and heavily traveled route between Richmond and Atlanta. The stretch of highway included in this project currently carries nearly 70,000 vehicles per day, with traffic counts projected to more than double by 2030. Trucks account for 26 percent of the traffic along this portion of I-85.
Right now, this stretch has only two lanes in each direction, with narrow shoulders, sharp curves and closely spaced interchanges. The existing I-85 Yadkin River Bridge is outdated and narrow and is currently rated in poor condition and classified as both structurally deficient (having elements that need to be monitored and/or repaired) and functionally obsolete (outdated in design).
The total crash rate for this portion of I-85 is about 77 percent higher than the average crash rate for comparable roadways across the state, while the fatal crash rate is 80 percent higher.
The project is expected to reduce crash rates by 75 percent and improve traffic flow by alleviating existing bottlenecks. Improvements to the railroad tracks that cross under I-85 will increase track speed by 45 percent and accommodate future rail needs, including the implementation of high-speed rail.
from an economic standpoint, the project has the potential to create or sustain more than 7,000 jobs, and it is expected to result in economic benefits 12 to 17 times its cost. This stretch of I-85 is in a region of the state that has been hard-hit by job losses, with both Davidson and Rowan counties qualifying as economically distressed areas under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965.
Gov. Perdue Joins Statewide Health Leaders at President's Town Hall

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday joined health leaders from across North Carolina to attend President Barack Obama’s health care forum at Broughton High School in Raleigh. The governor invited representatives from the state’s leading health care organizations, including hospitals, research institutions, advocates and minority groups, to attend the event with her.
“I applaud the president for prioritizing health care and for working with Congress to bring about change,” Perdue said. “Here in North Carolina, one in five of our citizens does not have health insurance. We are living the problem, and we are all anxious for a solution.
“When I spoke to President Obama this morning, I told him I believe strongly that reform must take place at the federal level.  We have innovative solutions to providing care in North Carolina, and we have excellent providers, but our finances are stretched to the limit.  We must ensure that the financial burden of a new system cannot fall to the states.  A national health care system must provide the right care, at the right time, at the right place – but at a price that people, and states, can afford.”

As a physician who has authored books on preventative health care, I was given the opportunity to be the keynote speaker at a Congressional Dinner at The Capitol Building in Washington last Friday (7/17).

The presentation was entitled Health Care Reform, The Power & Profit of Prevention, and I was gratified that it was well received.

In preparation for the presentation, I read the latest version of "reform" as authored by The Obama Administration and supported by Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid.  Here is the link to the 1,018 page document:

Let me summarize just a few salient points of the above plan.  First, however, it should be clear that the same warning notice must be placed on The ObamaCare Plan as on a pack of cigarettes:  Consuming this product will be hazardous to your health. 

The underlying method of cutting costs throughout the plan is based on rationing and denying care.  There is no focus on preventing health care need whatever. The plan's method is the most inhumane and unethical approach to cutting costs I can imagine as a physician.

The rationing of care is implemented through The National Health Care Board, according to the plan.  This illustrious Board "will approve or reject treatment for patients based on the cost per treatment divided by the number of years the patient will benefit from the treatment."

Translation.....if you are over 65 or have been recently diagnosed as having an advanced form of cardiac disease or aggressive cancer.....dream on if you think you will get treated.....pick out your coffin.

Oh, you say this could never happen? Sorry.... this is the same model they use in Britain.

The plan mandates that there will be little or no advanced treatments to be available in the future.  It creates The Federal Coordinating Council For Comparative Effectiveness Research, the purpose of which is "to slow the development of new medications and technologies in order to reduce costs."  Yes, this is to be the law.

The plan also outlines that doctors and hospitals will be overseen and reviewed by The National Coordinator For Health Information and Technology. 

This " coordinator" will "monitor treatments being delivered to make sure doctors and hospitals are strictly following government guidelines that are deemed appropriate." It goes on to say....."Doctors and hospitals not adhering to guidelines will face penalties." 

According to those in Congress, penalties could include large six figure financial fines and possible imprisonment. 

So according to The ObamaCare Plan....if your doctor saves your life you might have to go to the prison to see your doctor for follow -up appointments.  I believe this is the same model Stalin used in the former Soviet Union. 

Section 102 has the Orwellian title, "Protecting the Choice to Keep Current Coverage."  What this section really mandates is that it is illegal to keep your private insurance if your status changes - e.g., if you lose or change your job, retire from your job and become a senior, graduate from college and get your first job.  Yes, illegal.

When Mr. Obama hosted <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/20/obama-calls-on-bloggers-t_n_241570.html>a conference call with bloggers urging them to pressure Congress to pass his health plan as soon as possible, a blogger from Maine referenced an <http://www.ibdeditorials.com/IBDArticles.aspx?id=332548165656854>Investors Business Daily article that claimed Section 102 of the House health legislation would outlaw private insurance.

He asked: "Is this true? Will people be able to keep their insurance and will insurers be able to write new policies even though H.R. 3200 is passed?"  Mr. Obama replied: "You know, I have to say that I am not familiar with the provision you are talking about." 

Then there is Section 1233 of The ObamaCare Plan, devoted to  "Advanced Care Planning." After each American turns 65 years of age they have to go to a mandated counseling program that is designed to end life sooner.

This session is to occur every 5 years unless the person has developed a chronic illness then it must be done every year. The topics in this session will include, "how to decline hydration, nutrition and how to initiate hospice care."  It is no wonder The Obama Administration does not like my emphasis on Prevention.  For Mr. Obama, prevention is the "enemy" as people would live longer.

I rest my case. The ObamaCare Plan is hazardous to the health of every American.

After I finished my Capitol Hill presentation, I was asked by a Congressman in the question-answer session:  "I'll be doing a number of network interviews on the Obama Health Care Plan.  If I am asked what is the one word to describe the plan what should I answer."

The answer is simple, honest, direct, analytical, sad but truthful.  I told him that one word is FASCIST.

Then I added, "I hope you'll have the courage to use that word, Congressman.  No other word is more appropriate."

Subject: Inaction SB832 Inlet Stabilization Bill



Dear Governor Perdue:



Please urge Joe Hackney to let SB 832 bill be heard!



SB 832 has soundly passed the Senate and is stuck in the House Environment and Natural Resources committee. Please ask Joe to stop cow towing to the environmental fringe. The science supports the use of Terminal Groins at Inlets!



While this bill and bills like it have languished in committee, land and homes have been lost costing coastal homeowners hundreds of millions of dollars. These are not the rich, well connected environmental destroyers as characterized by the environmentalists. These are average people losing their nest egg to inaction. Whatever happened to free and open debate Mr. Speaker?



Preserve our natural beaches? There is nothing natural about our beaches. It is a false argument that is costing taxpayers and private property owner millions of dollars in losses. The Intra-Coastal Waterway and our beaches are a product of pumping billions of cubic yards of sand out of the inlets and Intra Coastal waterway. The Intra Coastal waterway is man-made water highway. The constant pumping of sand endangers inlet property. SB832 will keep this from happening.



The New Jerszyization of our beaches?…how about the FL GA SC VA MD RI CT MA NH ME of our beaches. They all allow groins and jetties at inlets AND THE WORK!



A gimmy for rich well connected coastal property owners? Talk to the property owners on the Ocean Isle Beach side of the Shallotte Inlet. The ones filing for bankruptcy would dispute this claim. We are only talking about groins at inlets. Not all ocean front property.



Please urge Joe Hackney to let SB 832 be heard!



Michael S Young

Rowan County Democrat



“...the citizens of North Carolina deserve no less than the power of the combination of all of our ideas and opinions, because democracy demands the opportunity for competition among ideas, and thrives only when what we produce has been tested and digested by survival in free and open debate.”

Subject: N.C. Racial Justice Act

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, after reading this morning's paper about the NC Racial Justice Act, I strongly disagree with this bill. I urge you to NOT pass this bill. I believe in the simple rule if you break the law you MUST serve your punishment whatever that is. I have a brother who is an inmate in a Federal Correctional Center and we are caucasian. On visiting days we are the minority. Usually 3 or 4 caucasian inmates to the 25 to 30 black inmates is what we have observed. So if more black men are doing the crimes why should they have a law that seems to protect them only because of color. Crime has no color but the people commiting the crimes seem to be a black majority. I stronly OPPOSE this bill and hope you reconsider your vote. Thank you, Carol Clark

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing to urge you to oppose Senate Bill 567.

We need energy efficiency, but we need renewable energy too.
Please do not allow this energy efficiency technology to count
as a renewable energy source. We not only need to cut down on
the amount of energy we use, and use the energy we have more
effectively, but we also need our energy to come from cleaner,
renewable sources.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing to ask that you veto the just-passed coastal insurance bill.  I think it is wrong to pass on to the general public any insurance/recovery costs for coastal properties.

If I go to a fancy steakhouse, I don't just pay for a portion of my meal and expect the other folks in the restaurant to pay the rest.  I take responsibility for the check when I sit down.

If people want to operate a business or own residential/rental property on the coast, they must take responsibility for the associated risks and costs.

If you or your staff would like to discuss this issue with me, I can be reached at work at 807-4860 or at home, 387-7326, in the evenings.

Thank you.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Please oppose Senate Bill 567.

Two years ago the state legislature passed comprehensive new
goals for renewable energy in North Carolina. But if the

Amend S567 to preserve our clean energy commitment.

To see that you have not approved of this incredibly important piece of legislation is incredibly absurd. The nations politicians have approved of billions and even trillions to bail out businesses that should not have been bailed out and yet cant seem to approve of a piece of legislation that will have a positive effect on our nations core economic industry, housing. DPA programs provided over $150 million of downpayment assistance and helped 25,000 creditworthy homebuyers per month. DPA provides immediate equity for homebuyers in safe, fixed-rate mortgages through the FHA program. FHA loans with DPA have performed far better than subprime loans. Because of the availability of DPA, more than one million people have become homeowners with safe, non-risky mortgages and have avoided the tragedy of foreclosure that many others are currently experiencing. The GAO has reported that 94 percent of these homeowners have met their mortgage responsibilities without undue difficulty. 6. Homes are losing their value every day because of rising foreclosures and the lack of new homebuyers entering the market. I could speak only for myself, but know many other people that have become frustrated with republicans and democrats alike. however, It is YOUR responsibility to approve this legislation for the good of our great nation. This in turn will speed up the healing of our economy especially since the entire foundation of our economy is housing. Congress can dump all the money in the world into bailouts, but all that will do is create an artificial bubble again. What our congress needs to do is pass the H.R.600 and put our money into repairing a crumbled foundation, one in which we can once again build our economy on and rely upon when the next recession hit. If we do not, we may not make it out of the next recession. Sincerely, Robert Appel 919-303-4789

Iâ€™ve been pushing them pretty hard for capacity and for them to reinstate some discounts on their homeowners in the east. This morning we had a 180 degree turn around in the ongoing conversation as a result of that HB 1305 legislation for the windpool. I actually wrote down their words while talking I was so surprised. They said â€œthis new bill has taken the North Carolina wind issue off the table with our reinsurers, we are now comfortable with this issue and our assessment potentialâ€. This will translate into reinstating premium discounts for citizens in New Bern and all of Eastern NC. I just wanted you to know and to thank you and the legislature for this good work. Mike McAden

Comment: Hello, I'm writing to you today to ask that you push for the passage of Davie's Law, Senate Bill 199 that bans gas chambers and only allows injection for euthanasia. This law ensures that: * Shelter animals will have a more humane, peaceful death. * Shelter workers will be protected from the harmful exposure to carbon monoxide. * Taxpayers will save money as gas chambers are more costly to operate and maintain. Thank you for your time and consideration, Anabel Salinas

Just reading the current wacky laws regarding shooting a person entering your home and stealing your stuff. Is it right that you can shoot them before they enter, however once they enter, or are leaving with your stuff, you can only watch and not shoot them, unless under fear of death?

I don't want to shoot anyone, however when someone intrudes on your home and thinks that your stuff is theirs, they forfeit the right to anything, including life.

My wife was parked at one of the beach parking lots in Pine Knoll Shores, and had her car window broken and intruded, stealing her pocket book. Besides the $250 we had to pay to replace the window, $5 to replace her fishing license, $10 to replace her drivers license, the loss of all of her credit cards, which we had to cancel and replace, in addition to other cards like AAA, Boat US and others, and about $100 in cash, had I caught this individual breaking in, I would have shot him.

Since when are criminals given more rights that victims???? Support HB 1131.

Subject: Protect patients: vote 'yes' on H 1380 and H 1383

Comment: Adam Gaubert 9569 Rainford Road Baton Rouge, LA 70810-4134 August 21, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Governor Perdue: I'm writing to urge your support for House Bill 1380 and House Bill 1383. These bills seek to enact statewide legal protections shielding those seriously ill patients who use cannabis therapeutically with a doctor's recommendation from criminal prosecution. The use of marijuana as medicine is a public health issue; it should not be part of the war on drugs. According to a recent national survey of U.S. physicians conducted for the American Society of Addiction Medicine, nearly half of all doctors with opinions support legalizing cannabis as a medicine. Some 80 state and national health care organizations, including the American Nurses Association, American Public Health Association and The New England Journal of Medicine, and the North Carolina Nurses Association support immediate, legal patient access to medical cannabis. Most recently, the largest association of doctors of internal medicine and the second largest medical association in the country, the American College of Physicians, released a policy paper in support of medical cannabis, stating, "The ACP strongly urges protection from criminal or civil penalties for patients who use medical marijuana as permitted under state laws." Thirteen states - Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington - have enacted laws protecting medical marijuana patients from state prosecution. These laws are operating primarily as lawmakers intended and have not led to widespread abuses among adolescents or adult recreational users. I believe it is unconscionable to deny this effective medicine to sick and dying patients, and I strongly urge you to support the medical use of marijuana in North Carolina and to vote 'yes' on H 1380 and H 1383. Sincerely, Adam Gaubert

Dear Governor Perdue,

Fifty-four million Americans report being bullied at work --
that's 37 percent of the workforce.

Workplace bullying is a public epidemic that is easily
overlooked. It can include verbal abuse, offensive behaviors
that are intimidating or humiliating, and sabotage that
interferes with work.

The recession makes it harder to find a new job when bullying
gets out of hand. And working with a bully in the office can be
very taxing. Bullying is a form of psychological violence that
can cause stress, depression and even suicide.

New York is leading the way with its Healthy Workplace Bill. The
State Assembly just passed two study bills that will authorize
and direct the department of labor to study hostile workplace
behavior and its consequences.

I fully support bills such as these and encourage you to enact
legislation in our state that will protect employees from
bullying in the workplace.


Sincerely,
