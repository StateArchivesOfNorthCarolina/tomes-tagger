Comment: HOw could you sign this budget into law? You made such a show about rejecting the first budget attempt sent to you, and then you turned around and signed something that is even worse. HOw in the world do you think that those of us who are middle class, working every day, paying taxes, can afford to pay even more tax increases? I did not vote for you, but I have tried to give you a chance to prove that you were a governor who would actually REDUCE spending before you went the old path and said that you have to raise taxes. Spend and tax, spend and tax. What else is new? I sincerely hope that those of us who work hard, pay our bills, and struggle to send our children to college can continue to do those things in light of your reckless spending. I'm sorry to say that your actions don't surprise me. It is just what I expected.Instead of taking time to see where the wasted money is, you simply took the easy road and decided to let those of us who pay taxes shoulder even more of the burden.

Comment: Unemployment in NC is over 11%, one of the highest in the nation! Now the legislature has signed a bill increasing taxes over 1 BILLION dollars and you're going to sign it??? Many states are balancing their budgets without tax increases, why can't you? I mean you did campaign on no new taxes! Working families and small businesses in NC are tightening their belts, why can't the government? It's time to stop taxing your citizens out of a life. DON'T SIGN A BUDGET WITH TAX INCREASES!!!!

I think Click it  or Lose it is a very good idea.  Lives will be saved.  How about drinking and driving?
It would be nice if  teacher  retirees got their cost of living for 2009.  We got no cost of living and our taxes is going up with local, state, and national govt. in one form or another.  Shouldn't everyone in govt. also give up their cost of living and bonuses, so that it is fair?   violetowens@aol.com

Gov. Perdue visits Surry and Alleghany counties

Surry County

> On Tuesday, Gov. Perdue attended a class and met with students at the Surry Early College High School of Design on Surry Community Collegeâ€™s campus in Dobson.  North Carolina is a national leader when it comes to Early Colleges, with 70 locations.  Students enrolled in this program attend high school on a college campus for five years and finish with a high school diploma and two years of transferable college credit or an associate degree â€“ at no cost to the student.

> Gov. Perdue met with Principal Celia Hodges, Community College President Dr. Deborah Friedman, members of the collegeâ€™s board, and other local education officials.  Most importantly, Gov. Perdue had the opportunity to sit in on a biology class taught by Jeff Edwards. 

> Students told the Governor about being excited to â€œget a really good head start on lifeâ€ and about how North Carolinaâ€™s Early College program makes higher education affordable to them.  Innovative programs like this are important to Gov. Perdueâ€™s goal of putting higher education within reach for all North Carolinians.

> Alleghany County

> On Wednesday, Gov. Perdue visited Sparta Elementary School.  As part of President Obamaâ€™s â€œUnited We Serveâ€ campaign for community service and volunteerism, the governor spoke with students about their responsibility of giving back to their communities.  She read the children's book â€œIâ€™m Gonna Like Me: Letting Off A Little Self-Esteemâ€ by actress Jamie Lee Curtis to a first grade class. 

> The governor also had the chance to talk to Superintendent Cox, Principal Barnes, and teachers about how technology is making a difference in their classrooms and about diagnostic testing.

> DuPont Brings $55 Million Expansion to Bladen County

DuPont will add a new facility on a portion of its Fayetteville Works campus in Bladen County, creating 10 jobs and investing $55 million during the next three years.  The announcement of the new plant, which will make a key component in solar energy panels, was made possible in part by a $50,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

> â€œDuPont's expansion confirms that we are reaping the benefits from our investments in a knowledge-based work force and community infrastructure,â€ Perdue said.  â€œSupport of our existing industries, education and an exceptional quality of life are among the many reasons North Carolina's business climate is consistently ranked among the top in the nation.â€

> DuPont employs 60,000 workers in 70 countries worldwide, including more than 900 at N.C. facilities in Fayetteville, Kinston and the Research Triangle Park.  The new plant, in Bladen County near the Cumberland-Bladen County line, will produce polymer for DuPont â„¢ TedlarÂ® polyvinyl fluoride film used in the protective backsheets of photovoltaic solar panels.  These panels convert light into electric power.  The photovoltaic industry is experiencing worldwide growth as consumers turn to alternatives such as fossil fuels. 

> Salaries for the 10 new skilled manufacturer positions will vary by job type, but the average annual wage will be $36,278, not including benefits, more than the Bladen County average annual wage of $25,792.

> For more information about DuPontâ„¢ TedlarÂ® films or potential job opportunities, please visit: <http://www.dupont.com/>www.dupont.com.

> Swedish Firm Relocates U.S. Headquarters to Charlotte

Biotage LLC, a Swedish company that develops and manufactures instruments and consumables for pharmaceutical research, will relocate its United States headquarters to Charlotte.  The company plans to invest in facility upgrades and create 21 new jobs in Mecklenburg County.

> â€œNorth Carolina is known globally as a strategic location for tapping into the North American market,â€ Perdue said.  â€œOur top-rated business climate and highly skilled workforce continue to attract global companies looking to invest and expand.â€

> Biotage is a leading supplier of tools and technology for medicinal and analytical chemistry and process development.  The company, headquartered in Sweden, has offices in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Japan and employs nearly 270 workers worldwide.

> The company is planning to move its U.S. headquarters from Virginia to North Carolina.  Operations in Charlotte will include general administration, marketing and sales, and lab work for applications development, light manufacturing and distribution.

> Gov. Perdue Announces Launch of 15th Anniversary "Booze It & Lose It" Campaign

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced the launch of the 15th anniversary â€œBooze It & Lose Itâ€ mobilization to crack down on impaired drivers. The Labor Day â€œBooze It & Lose Itâ€ campaign will begin Aug. 21 and run until Sept. 7.

> â€œUnder no circumstance is drinking and driving acceptable in North Carolina,â€ said Perdue. â€œFor 15 years, the â€˜Booze It & Lose Itâ€™ initiative has played a critical role in protecting our citizens by educating the public and cracking down on impaired driving. Weâ€™ll keep using this life-saving campaign as a tool to enforce our stateâ€™s anti-drinking and driving laws.â€

> In North Carolina in 2008, there were 11,968 alcohol-related crashes resulting in 433 fatalities and 9,263 injuries.

> â€œBooze It & Lose Itâ€ is administered by the N.C. Governorâ€™s Highway Safety Program. The initiative began in 1994 and was created to zero in on impaired drivers with innovative and extensive anti-driving while impaired enforcement and education. Since 1994, law enforcement agencies have conducted more than 194,000 checkpoints and patrols during â€œBooze It & Lose Itâ€ campaigns resulting in more than 103,000 driving while impaired citations.
>  
> Additional checkpoints and patrols will be conducted across the state throughout the campaign.

> Fight the Flu - Back to School

As thousands of students in North Carolina prepare to return to school, many will be armed with notebooks and pencils, but they also should be armed with tips to fight the spread of seasonal and H1N1 flu.

> Everyone is advised to get a seasonal Flu Vaccine. H1N1 vaccines are expected by late fall. High risk groups, including school-aged children, are advised to get a double dose H1N1 vaccination.

> Prevention is critical.  Here are some simple steps:

> 1) Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.  If you donâ€™t have tissue, cough or sneeze into your sleeve.

> 2) Wash your hands often with soap and water. Alcohol-based hand cleaners also are effective.

> 3) Avoid close contact with sick people.

> 4) If you are sick, stay home to limit the chances of infecting others.

Comment: I would like to know why Sen. Allran's recommendations were never considered. He has shown places where millions of dollars could be cut. Governor you and your party are playing partisan politics instead of doing what the people of NC want you to do. You and all the legislators on both sides are elected to represent the will of the people. The democrats have shown however that they want their own pet projects sent through without the will of the people being considered. Gov. Perdue, I know that this will never get to your desk and some aide will read it and probably do nothing but I challenge you Governor to set politics aside and just listen to a plain old North Carolina boy, born and bred, and see what people really want. Thanks and God bless,
