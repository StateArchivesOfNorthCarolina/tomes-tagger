It was very sneaky that the state sales tax was raised with NO notice and no input by merchants who do not deserve another blow to our economy..

Greetings Governor Bev Purdue,

"The greatest service that can be rendered to any country is to add a useful plant to its culture." -Thomas Jefferson

I wanted to thank you all for showing me support at the recent city council meetings I have attended.

I am excited to present Charlotte Hempfest Round 2 in effect on September 20th. At the festival, there will be different products from companies around North America that are involved in the hemp trade.

This letter is intended to gain support through North Carolina’s political network as a reputable citizen who represents the will of the American people.

America still remains the only industrialized nation in the world that does not grow industrial hemp.

It is time our country catch up and lead the world as a super-power, both economically and in peace. It is simple economics, if there is a demand for a product, people will buy it, regardless if it is imported from Canada, China or England. That’s the reason America will grow industrial hemp, not only to create jobs through the manufacturing of different hemp products but to provide its citizens hemp at an affordable domestic price.

Recently, the American nation has expressed concern over our environment but in today’s troubled economy, the higher priced ‘green’ products are being overlooked by a vast majority of the American public. Why? Because the pay check to pay check America is not concerned about the environment, but about feeding themselves and their children, making sure the bills are paid and the roof over their head is safe.

The American people agree that the environmental impact the cultivation of industrial hemp will have on our everyday products is a change that will coexist with nature. America will be a nation of green consumer based products, grown domestically and will keep the value of the American dollar strong.

A friend of mine the other day reminded me of the spirit that exists in our country, when choosing whether to buy a part for his automobile from China or from America, he chose America. He stated that he would rather use his American dollar to support a fellow hard-working American and this is exactly what industrial hemp will do for our nation.

Jobs will no longer be shipped across seas, due to hemp’s legality and cheap labor but will be known for their environmental qualities and affordability. This spirit has guided our country throughout history and it will continue to guide our nation for generations to come.

The issue over marijuana is also simple economics. The American public who uses marijuana frequently will continue to use it frequently regardless of what the law entails. Marijuana has already proven itself as a cure for cancer, note the documentary Run From the Cure, the story of Rick Simpson. In a society where harmful substances like alcohol and tobacco are legal, it is hypocrisy to not include marijuana as a legal substance especially when marijuana has proven itself to have medical benefits.

The issue over health care is not about how much money is there to spend but using effective medicines that work. Marijuana has a proven history as being the most beneficial medicine throughout many different cultures and nationalities over the past 5000 years. The documentary, Run from the Cure, will demonstrate that marijuana can be made into an oil that may be applied externally to infected areas of pain or disease or may be ingested orally to relieve pain and help fight internal diseases.

Marijuana as a medicine shall be a priority in the state of North Carolina to show the nation the progressive nature of our current nation. North Carolina is regarded as a conservative, traditional state where a change like this seems impossible so when it does, North Carolina will influence and inspire other states to follow suit. We must not neglect the suffering of our patients, not only in our state but throughout all the United States of America. Medical marijuana works, and it is in the best interest to allow it’s use in our state.

We must be the change we see in our nation and lead future generation’s of America towards prosperity. Please support Representative’s Nick Mackey and Earl Jones on the proposed medical marijuana bill written by attorney Ben Scales here in North Carolina.

This letter is intended to gain support through North Carolina’s political network as a reputable citizen who represents the will of the American people. You are the ones who make change a reality and it is time for America to prosper once again!

Please feel free to contact Xavier Veille to set up a meeting to discuss this issue.

Sincerely,
--
Xavier Veille

[BAILOUT 28]  Financing Universal Healthcare     9/11/09
.
Fixing supper in my kitchen, wearing headphones listening to NPR while Obama spoke to Congress about America's Healthcare Crisis, it sounded so hopeful.  Until he got down to dissing and dumping on the only Plan that can work: Universal Single Payer Healthcare.
.
That's when I took my headphones off, and shook my head is disbelief. Obama knows this is the ONLY way to cover all Americans.  I sat down with my plate of fresh food from my tiny subsistence garden, and reluctantly listened some more.
.
Never have I heard such a convoluted mish-mash of stupid ideas stitched together with invisible, imaginary thread in my life.  The man I once thought could be America's Great Hope wasted this marvelous opportunity to become a hero by tossing Scraps of Appeasement to as many in his Joint Congressional Audience as he was able in the brief time he had.
.
As I listened, I realized that he was surgically butchering the only chance that I will ever have any Healthcare for the rest of my life.
.
Educated as an Industrial Designer, I know that anything this confoundingly complex has but one purpose:  it's designed to fail.
.
Politicians who are more skillful at skulduggery than the President have suckered him down a road that leads into a black hole, a place from which his Administration shall never exit.
_____________________________
.
In the 2 days since, I've never been so glad that I have not owned a TV in 3 years.  Not only was I not distracted by Obama's posturing during his speech, but neither have I had to watch the Gross National Distraction which must be going on about a Congressman yelling out something, which I heard, but did not recognize. I've picked up from Internet chatter that it was some Congressman who yelled out something like, "You liar!"  Or whatever.  It was like the guy that threw his shoes at Bush:  symbolic, but useless.
.
What a worthless distraction, the exact kind of diversion that Corporate TV media wanted.  Wouldn't put it past Corporate Media to have put him up to it, promising him a ton of Campaign money for 2010.
.
Anything to keep from having to deal with the truth:  Americans are being murdered and tortured every day that Universal Healthcare is not enacted, purely and solely for profit of the Corporate Healthcare Mafia.  To the extent that Obama refused to address this reality, he lied.
.
The Yell-out by one person overpowered any meaningful Healthcare Debate everywhere on TV, just like paid-for Teabaggers keep hogging every second of Media coverage they can manage, to preserve the Murder for Profit Industry in America.
.
BUT what IF?  What if Obama had found the courage to tell the truth?
.
What if he had said this:  "For far too long, our Healthcare Industry has been raking in profits from murdering and torturing Americans.  It's time this comes to a screeching halt.  Both houses of Congress are here in session in this room.  I put before you the question of  <http://www.pnhp.org/publications/united_states_national_health_care_act_hr_676.php>HR 676:  Universal Healthcare for all Americans."
.
"All those in favor, signify: 'Aye!'  None opposed, it is so ordered."
.
And that would be that.  The Carnival of the Absurd would be over.
____________________________
.
Who was Obama speaking to?  What was the real significance of his speech?  
.
Follow the money to find out:  <http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/20090910_insurance_stocks_rise_after_obama_speech/>Insurance Stocks Rise After Obama Speech (Truthdig):
Remember President Obama’s reference during his health care address to “Wall Street’s relentless profit expectations”? Well, those expectations were apparently met by that same address. Insurance company stocks got a boost from the speech, which foreshadowed the death of the public option and promised to deliver millions of currently “irresponsible” customers.
____________________________
.
The day after Obama's speech, the second richest man in America, Warren Buffet, spoke with a Senate Committee, telling them this:  Rich people are not paying enough taxes. <http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/58129-buffett-to-meet-with-senate-dems>http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/58129-buffett-to-meet-with-senate-dems
.
Buffett told lawmakers that because of the cuts to the capital gains tax passed under former President George W. Bush, he pays taxes at a lower rate than some of his company’s employees.

It is an argument the investor has made before. Buffett said he paid a 16.5 percent tax rate on all his income because the tax rate on investment dividends and long-term capital gains is only 15 percent.

By contrast, a single employee at Buffet’s firm, Berkshire Hathaway, who earns between $33,000 and $83,000 must pay a 25 percent federal income tax rate.
.
Obama inferred in his speech, if I remember correctly, that repealing the Bush tax cuts is more than enough to finance Healthcare for All Americans.  But, he was too much of a coward to go there.
____________________________
.
And so, we have arrived at 9/11 once more. On this, the 8th Anniversary, Obama is still fighting the Afghanistan War which Acting President Dick Cheney abandoned unfinished -- quit -- to start his long sought War for Oil in Iraq.  The long aftermath of that War is just beginning, and no Oil from Iraq has paid for any Wars:  It's all been charged to our National Debt, the giant Credit Card which our children's children's children will still be paying off long after we are dead and gone, if America survives that long.
.
This week I got 2 DVDs from my free Socialist Public Library, which I got to by driving across my Socialist Streets and Highways, by a Socialist Middle School, located next to my Socialist Fire Department, near my Socialist National Guard Armory where everyone there is on fully Socialized Medicine.
.
Just by chance, Michael Moore's Sicko had been turned in, and although I had watched it before, I checked it out to watch on my computer after Obama's Speech. I have a link posted on my Website for Sicko at <http://earthhome.us/Contact_Us.html>http://earthhome.us/Contact_Us.html, which ironically I cannot watch there because I'm on cheap, super-slow dial-up Internet access.  
.
Watching it again, I could not keep from choking up as 4 seriously ill 9/11 rescue worker-heros who cannot get Healthcare in the US had gone to Communist Cuba to find it for free, and they were walking past firemen at a Cuban Fire Station, standing at attention to honor them.
.
What in God's name has the super-powerful Satanic Healthcare Mafia done to my America?
.
Prisoners at Guantanamo Bay have better US government-paid Healthcare than millions of my fellow Americans, who have spent their lives working their jobs, paying their taxes, and paying their premiums, yet are denied Healthcare.  No matter what lies Obama told, millions of Americans will still not have Healthcare whenever -- if ever -- after some mangled piece-O-crap is delivered to him to sign.
.
All so that profits to the Super Richest Americans can keep flowing, unabated.
____________________________
.
I also picked up a PBS Frontlines Video called Bush's War.  I watched the first part of 270 minutes last night.  This covers the Bush/Cheney/Congressional Wars for Oil from 9/11 up until 2008.  I plan to spend the rest of today watching it, pausing between sections to reflect, and to write this Bailout Edition. Early this morning, I found this:

William Rivers Pitt, Truthout: "Does anyone even remember the first eight months of the George W. Bush administration? It was an unmitigated train wreck. One of the last nails in our current economic coffin got hammered in when he gave away the Clinton surplus to his one-percenter buddies with a massive tax cut we couldn't afford and they didn't need. Chinese fighters swatted some of our airmen out of the sky, and George made sure they had Bibles." .
.
"when he gave away the Clinton surplus to his one-percenter buddies with a massive tax cut we couldn't afford and they didn't need."
.
I remember well the Clinton surplus.  For one brief shining moment, it looked like for the first time in a very long time, America's citizens were going to get on their feet, and life would become beautiful again.
.
Then the NeoCONs and RethugliCONs panicked.  What was happening to their Cash Cow: their intentionally debt-ridden US Government?  This will never do, they said, so they stole the 2000 Election.  
.
America has been on a fast track to The Bottom ever since.  Only The Bottom keeps falling faster than we are, and we'll never see daylight again.
.
The only way to break our fall is to break the back of the Healthcare Mafia.

Thank you for your speech, Mr. Obama.

for ALL Americans, just waiting for you 
to find the courage to re-claim it.

Kudos to Gov. Beverly for vetoeing the bill to limit access to public records!  This is the right path for making public servants accountable to those they represent and a start to restore ethics in government.   JB

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday called on North Carolina residents to re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of the school year and the arrival of flu season.

> “Parents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,” Perdue said.  “I don’t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.”

> Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line of prevention;

> - Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
> - If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.
> - Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.
> - Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
> - Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
> - If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.
> - Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.

> Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.

> “When a home is foreclosed — it’s bad for our families, it’s bad for our communities, it’s bad for our businesses and it’s bad for North Carolina,” said Perdue.  “This bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.”

> Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.

> SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.

> Consumer tips on home loans, debt collectors and many other topics are available from the Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division at <http://www.ncdoj.gov>www.ncdoj.gov.

X-Folder: 9/11-Day of Remembrance not service
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Dear Governor Purdue,



While I recognize and encourage community service as a way-of-life commitment, I find the association of a “day of service”  with remembrance of the tragedy of 9/11 to be in very poor taste, and for it to come from the President of this country and be endorsed by the Governor of my state is insulting to all.  Remembering 9/11 is about honoring and respecting  the memory of not only those who died and those who helped, but also the survivors.  It is about REMEMBERING the  lessons learned from a pivotal  event in this country’s history—a recognition that we as a nation are vulnerable to intense hatred and evil—from within. 



Your service projects are excellent, but the timing of their publicity demeans the significance of 9/11.    



Gail Leighton

9/11 - National Day of Service and Remembrance

Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance and the culmination of the “United We Serve” campaign.  Governor Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet Secretaries, Governor’s Office staff, state government employees and citizens across North Carolina have participated in this campaign to serve others.

Volunteering always is important, but this especially rings true in these tough economic times when so many need so much help.  

On Thursday, Gov. Perdue helped launch “Books on Bases, Smiles on Faces,” a literacy program for military children by Blue Star Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).   She spoke to military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read “Home is Where the Army Sends You” by local author Melissa Davis.  She also helped distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high population of military children.

Dear Governor Perdue,



This is not a national day of service, but one of mourning! You would do well to remember with the rest of us what a horrific thing was done to this country on September 9, 2001 by Islamic extremists. Instead of joining our near muslim president in trying to erase the brutality of the day that Islam declared open war on the United States through extremely cowardly attacks on innocent citizens, I would invite you to weep with the rest of us today for what we have lost.



Regards,



Will Dallas

“Parents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,” Perdue said.  “I don’t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.”

Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line of prevention;

- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
- If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
- Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
- If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.
- Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.

Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.

“When a home is foreclosed — it’s bad for our families, it’s bad for our communities, it’s bad for our businesses and it’s bad for North Carolina,” said Perdue.  “This bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.”

Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.

SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.

Consumer tips on home loans, debt collectors and many other topics are available from the Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division at <http://www.ncdoj.gov>www.ncdoj.gov.

Furniture Maker Brings New Plant, 128 Jobs to Alexander County

Caye Home Furnishings, an international manufacturer of custom home furniture, will open a new plant in Taylorsville.  The company plans to invest $1.4 million and create 128 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

“North Carolina, known worldwide for producing fine furniture, continues to be a leading player in this vital manufacturing sector,” Perdue said.  “Our state’s skilled workforce and superb quality of life continue to attract growing companies like Caye Home Furnishings.”

Caye Home Furnishings LLC, headquartered in Mississippi, manufactures living room furniture and case goods including products marketed under the Stratford and Stratolounger name brands.  The company has five manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, Florida, two in China and one in Star, N.C., which opened in August 2008 and employs 52 workers.  The new Taylorsville plant will assemble furniture products to serve that growing market.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $30,142, not including benefits, which is higher than Alexander County’s average annual wage of $27,300.

TurboCare Announces $30M Expansion in Rural Hall

TurboCare Inc., a subsidiary of Siemens Energy that provides turbomachinery parts and services to companies around the world, will expand its Forsyth County facility, creating 110 jobs and investing $30 million during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $220,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

“TurboCare’s expansion is a win for Rural Hall and for North Carolina,” Perdue said. “That so many international companies doing business in North Carolina choose to expand here when they have options around the country and around the world shows that our commitments to education, training and a business-friendly environment continue to prove successful.”

Gov. Perdue Announces the Blue Ridge Parkway to be Honored in U.S. Mint Program

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday announced that the Blue Ridge Parkway will be honored in the new U.S. Mint America the Beautiful Quarters program.  Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner approved the list of sites recommended by the U.S. Mint on Aug. 25, 2009, after consultation with Governor Perdue and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar.

“Countless visitors from around the world have lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway – one of America’s great treasures,” said Perdue. “Now the lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway and its majestic legacy will be captured on these special coins.”

The United States Mint’s America the Beautiful Quarters Program is a 12-year initiative authorized by the America’s Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008.  The act directs the United States Mint to strike and issue 56 circulating quarters with tails side designs emblematic of a national park or other national site in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories — Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands.

The quarters will be issued sequentially each year, in the order in which the featured site was first established as a national park or site.  The coins’ heads side will feature the familiar “restored” 1932 portrait of George Washington, including subtle details and the beauty of the original model.

To view the complete National Site Registry, which lists all 56 sites to be honored under the U.S. Mint’s America the Beautiful Quarters Program in chronological order by year, please visit <http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/NSQuartersProgram/?action=siteRegister>www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/NSQuartersProgram/?action=siteRegister.

[BAILOUT 28]  Financing Universal Healthcare     9/11/09
.
Fixing supper in my kitchen, wearing headphones listening to NPR while Obama spoke to Congress about America's Healthcare Crisis, it sounded so hopeful.  Until he got down to dissing and dumping on the only Plan that can work: Universal Single Payer Healthcare.
.
That's when I took my headphones off, and shook my head is disbelief. Obama knows this is the ONLY way to cover all Americans.  I sat down with my plate of fresh food from my tiny subsistence garden, and reluctantly listened some more.
.
Never have I heard such a convoluted mish-mash of stupid ideas stitched together with invisible, imaginary thread in my life.  The man I once thought could be America's Great Hope wasted this marvelous opportunity to become a hero by tossing Scraps of Appeasement to as many in his Joint Congressional Audience as he was able in the brief time he had.
.
As I listened, I realized that he was surgically butchering the only chance that I will ever have any Healthcare for the rest of my life.
.
Educated as an Industrial Designer, I know that anything this confoundingly complex has but one purpose:  it's designed to fail.
.
Politicians who are more skillful at skulduggery than the President have suckered him down a road that leads into a black hole, a place from which his Administration shall never exit.
_____________________________
.
In the 2 days since, I've never been so glad that I have not owned a TV in 3 years.  Not only was I not distracted by Obama's posturing during his speech, but neither have I had to watch the Gross National Distraction which must be going on about a Congressman yelling out something, which I heard, but did not recognize. I've picked up from Internet chatter that it was some Congressman who yelled out something like, "You liar!"  Or whatever.  It was like the guy that threw his shoes at Bush:  symbolic, but useless.
.
What a worthless distraction, the exact kind of diversion that Corporate TV media wanted.  Wouldn't put it past Corporate Media to have put him up to it, promising him a ton of Campaign money for 2010.
.
Anything to keep from having to deal with the truth:  Americans are being murdered and tortured every day that Universal Healthcare is not enacted, purely and solely for profit of the Corporate Healthcare Mafia.  To the extent that Obama refused to address this reality, he lied.
.
The Yell-out by one person overpowered any meaningful Healthcare Debate everywhere on TV, just like paid-for Teabaggers keep hogging every second of Media coverage they can manage, to preserve the Murder for Profit Industry in America.
.
BUT what IF?  What if Obama had found the courage to tell the truth?
.
What if he had said this:  "For far too long, our Healthcare Industry has been raking in profits from murdering and torturing Americans.  It's time this comes to a screeching halt.  Both houses of Congress are here in session in this room.  I put before you the question of  <http://www.pnhp.org/publications/united_states_national_health_care_act_hr_676.php>HR 676:  Universal Healthcare for all Americans."
.
"All those in favor, signify: 'Aye!'  None opposed, it is so ordered."
.
And that would be that.  The Carnival of the Absurd would be over.
____________________________
.
Who was Obama speaking to?  What was the real significance of his speech?  
.
Follow the money to find out:  <http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/20090910_insurance_stocks_rise_after_obama_speech/>Insurance Stocks Rise After Obama Speech (Truthdig):
Remember President Obama’s reference during his health care address to “Wall Street’s relentless profit expectations”? Well, those expectations were apparently met by that same address. Insurance company stocks got a boost from the speech, which foreshadowed the death of the public option and promised to deliver millions of currently “irresponsible” customers.
____________________________
.
The day after Obama's speech, the second richest man in America, Warren Buffet, spoke with a Senate Committee, telling them this:  Rich people are not paying enough taxes. <http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/58129-buffett-to-meet-with-senate-dems>http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/58129-buffett-to-meet-with-senate-dems
.
Buffett told lawmakers that because of the cuts to the capital gains tax passed under former President George W. Bush, he pays taxes at a lower rate than some of his company’s employees.

It is an argument the investor has made before. Buffett said he paid a 16.5 percent tax rate on all his income because the tax rate on investment dividends and long-term capital gains is only 15 percent.

By contrast, a single employee at Buffet’s firm, Berkshire Hathaway, who earns between $33,000 and $83,000 must pay a 25 percent federal income tax rate.
.
Obama inferred in his speech, if I remember correctly, that repealing the Bush tax cuts is more than enough to finance Healthcare for All Americans.  But, he was too much of a coward to go there.
____________________________
.
And so, we have arrived at 9/11 once more. On this, the 8th Anniversary, Obama is still fighting the Afghanistan War which Acting President Dick Cheney abandoned unfinished -- quit -- to start his long sought War for Oil in Iraq.  The long aftermath of that War is just beginning, and no Oil from Iraq has paid for any Wars:  It's all been charged to our National Debt, the giant Credit Card which our children's children's children will still be paying off long after we are dead and gone, if America survives that long.
.
This week I got 2 DVDs from my free Socialist Public Library, which I got to by driving across my Socialist Streets and Highways, by a Socialist Middle School, located next to my Socialist Fire Department, near my Socialist National Guard Armory where everyone there is on fully Socialized Medicine.
.
Just by chance, Michael Moore's Sicko had been turned in, and although I had watched it before, I checked it out to watch on my computer after Obama's Speech. I have a link posted on my Website for Sicko at <http://earthhome.us/Contact_Us.html>http://earthhome.us/Contact_Us.html, which ironically I cannot watch there because I'm on cheap, super-slow dial-up Internet access.  
.
Watching it again, I could not keep from choking up as 4 seriously ill 9/11 rescue worker-heros who cannot get Healthcare in the US had gone to Communist Cuba to find it for free, and they were walking past firemen at a Cuban Fire Station, standing at attention to honor them.
.
What in God's name has the super-powerful Satanic Healthcare Mafia done to my America?
.
Prisoners at Guantanamo Bay have better US government-paid Healthcare than millions of my fellow Americans, who have spent their lives working their jobs, paying their taxes, and paying their premiums, yet are denied Healthcare.  No matter what lies Obama told, millions of Americans will still not have Healthcare whenever -- if ever -- after some mangled piece-O-crap is delivered to him to sign.
.
All so that profits to the Super Richest Americans can keep flowing, unabated.
____________________________
.
I also picked up a PBS Frontlines Video called Bush's War.  I watched the first part of 270 minutes last night.  This covers the Bush/Cheney/Congressional Wars for Oil from 9/11 up until 2008.  I plan to spend the rest of today watching it, pausing between sections to reflect, and to write this Bailout Edition. Early this morning, I found this:

William Rivers Pitt | Eight Years Ago
<http://messenger.truthout.org/ss/link.php?M=96386&N=241&C=fb975cf26e3a84d9f44f6b8350d7a999&L=2283>http://www.truthout.org/091009R?n 
William Rivers Pitt, Truthout: "Does anyone even remember the first eight months of the George W. Bush administration? It was an unmitigated train wreck. One of the last nails in our current economic coffin got hammered in when he gave away the Clinton surplus to his one-percenter buddies with a massive tax cut we couldn't afford and they didn't need. Chinese fighters swatted some of our airmen out of the sky, and George made sure they had Bibles." .
.
"when he gave away the Clinton surplus to his one-percenter buddies with a massive tax cut we couldn't afford and they didn't need."
.
I remember well the Clinton surplus.  For one brief shining moment, it looked like for the first time in a very long time, America's citizens were going to get on their feet, and life would become beautiful again.
.
Then the NeoCONs and RethugliCONs panicked.  What was happening to their Cash Cow: their intentionally debt-ridden US Government?  This will never do, they said, so they stole the 2000 Election.  
.
America has been on a fast track to The Bottom ever since.  Only The Bottom keeps falling faster than we are, and we'll never see daylight again.
.
The only way to break our fall is to break the back of the Healthcare Mafia.

to find the courage to re-claim it.

First, illegal immigration is not, in the main, a security issue; an argument can be made that continued illegal immigration, as is the case with any illegal activity, may erode the rule of law and is costly to the American public, but these are not security arguments; second, if we want to make sure no WMDs are smuggled into the United States, there is no alternative to the 100 percent inspection mandate

Governor,

Thanks for the email.

i do disagree with the naming or Sept 11th as a National Day of Service and Remembrance because it will always be remembered for what it is,  a day to Honor those who gave their lives in the name of Freedom.

Americans are the most giving people in the WORLD, proven time and time again, while never asking for anything in return!

Government service groups are just that, government organized, not Americans volunteering own their own FREE WILL to help others in need. NOT A GOVERNMENT SPONSORED PROGRAM. TOO MUCH GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IN OUR LIVES>

GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF OUR WAY AND WE WILL RISE TO THE OCCASION AS WE ALWAYS HAVE, THAT'S WHO WE ARE!!! WE DID IT ON 9/11 AND AGAIN ON 9/12, AFTER KATRINA. ETC.

WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS INVOLVED, CORRUPTION OCCURS, MONEY IS WASTED AND EVERYTHING SEENS TO GET MESSED UP!

TAKE A LOOK AROUND AND YOU WILL SEE EXAMPLES OF BOTH EVERYWHERE.

 AMERICANS BEING AMERICANS AND GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION!

SINCERELY, CHRIS TAYLOR

> 9/11 - National Day of Service and Remembrance

Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance and the culmination of the â€œUnited We Serveâ€ campaign.  Governor Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet Secretaries, Governorâ€™s Office staff, state government employees and citizens across North Carolina have participated in this campaign to serve others.

> Volunteering always is important, but this especially rings true in these tough economic times when so many need so much help.  

> On Thursday, Gov. Perdue helped launch â€œBooks on Bases, Smiles on Faces,â€ a literacy program for military children by Blue Star Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).   She spoke to military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read â€œHome is Where the Army Sends Youâ€ by local author Melissa Davis.  She also helped distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high population of military children.

> The Governor also announced that N.C. AmeriCorps members and N.C. National Guard armories have united in a service project to honor military families.  The theme was â€œLittle Heroes Family Connection.â€ AmeriCorps program members gathered across the state to collect items and assemble packages to help children create a message for deployed parents or family members.

> â€œThrough this United We Serve project, North Carolinaâ€™s AmeriCorps members and National Guard have shown that it only takes a small effort to give something back to their communities,â€ Perdue said. â€œBy serving â€” we honor those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we build strong families and strong communities all over North Carolina.â€

> Today, Governor Perdue planted collard greens and cabbages at the Executive Mansion as part of the â€œPlant a Row for the Hungryâ€ campaign.  Plant a Row (PAR) is a national campaign to encourage all gardeners to grow a little extra produce to donate to the hungry and homeless.  The Raleigh PAR campaign collects produce to donate to the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle.

> Gov. Perdue Vetoes Bill That Would Limit Access to Public Records

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday vetoed House Bill 104, â€œAn Act To Clarify Legislative Confidentiality.â€

> â€œTransparency and accountability are hallmarks of my administration.  If this legislation became law, documents that are currently public record would become private,â€ said Perdue.  â€œAdditionally, this bill treats certain state employees unequally.â€

> The General Assembly passed the legislation on August 10 after making significant changes during the last days of legislative session.

> Pursuant to the Constitution, the Governor must call a special session no later than September 20 unless a majority of each house signs a written document stating that there is no need for the session to be convened.

> Gov. Perdue Calls for Focus on Prevention as Flu Season Arrives

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday called on North Carolina residents to re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of the school year and the arrival of flu season.

> â€œParents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,â€ Perdue said.  â€œI donâ€™t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.â€

> Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line of prevention;

> - Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
> - If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.
> - Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.
> - Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
> - Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
> - If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.
> - Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.

> Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.

> â€œWhen a home is foreclosed â€” itâ€™s bad for our families, itâ€™s bad for our communities, itâ€™s bad for our businesses and itâ€™s bad for North Carolina,â€ said Perdue.  â€œThis bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.â€

> Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.

> SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.

> Consumer tips on home loans, debt collectors and many other topics are available from the Attorney Generalâ€™s Consumer Protection Division at <http://www.ncdoj.gov/>www.ncdoj.gov.

> Furniture Maker Brings New Plant, 128 Jobs to Alexander County

Caye Home Furnishings, an international manufacturer of custom home furniture, will open a new plant in Taylorsville.  The company plans to invest $1.4 million and create 128 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

> â€œNorth Carolina, known worldwide for producing fine furniture, continues to be a leading player in this vital manufacturing sector,â€ Perdue said.  â€œOur stateâ€™s skilled workforce and superb quality of life continue to attract growing companies like Caye Home Furnishings.â€

> Caye Home Furnishings LLC, headquartered in Mississippi, manufactures living room furniture and case goods including products marketed under the Stratford and Stratolounger name brands.  The company has five manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, Florida, two in China and one in Star, N.C., which opened in August 2008 and employs 52 workers.  The new Taylorsville plant will assemble furniture products to serve that growing market.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $30,142, not including benefits, which is higher than Alexander Countyâ€™s average annual wage of $27,300.

This is not a National Day of Service...The United States was attacked and many innocent people were killed by people who hate Americans.  It is a day to remember.  It is a day of mourning and saddness. 
Stop the maddness...a day of service, why has the President disrespected the families of the people who were murdered, the people who died trying to save the innocent victims of this horrible attack.

Governor Perdue,

September 11th will always mean only one thing in my home. 
With each year that passes I wonder why the memory doesn't fade just a little.  I still can't even look at a clock when it's at 9:11, and not automatically almost cry thinking about that day.  I am personally offended and disturbed for my country that President Obama has attempted to "put a new face" on this tragic day in our country's history.  Political differences with President Bush asided, he should remember that terrorists attacked US soil and killed thousands of innocent lives.

Your enthusiastic participation in this new National Day of Service to glorify Obama's United We Serve campaign makes me think much less of you as the leader of my state.  North Carolina is a strong and proud military state and this politicization of 9/11 is just wrong!  It should be a day that continues to be one of remembrance and mourning for those innocent lives lost.  It should be a constant reminder to those in authority that vigilence is necessary to keep it from happening again.  That's what 9/11 should be!

Sincerely,
Celia Thiel

9/11 - National Day of Service and Remembrance

Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance and the culmination of the “United We Serve” campaign.  Governor Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet Secretaries, Governor’s Office staff, state government employees and citizens across North Carolina have participated in this campaign to serve others.

Volunteering always is important, but this especially rings true in these tough economic times when so many need so much help.  

On Thursday, Gov. Perdue helped launch “Books on Bases, Smiles on Faces,” a literacy program for military children by Blue Star Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).   She spoke to military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read “Home is Where the Army Sends You” by local author Melissa Davis.  She also helped distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high population of military children.

The Governor also announced that N.C. AmeriCorps members and N.C. National Guard armories have united in a service project to honor military families.  The theme was “Little Heroes Family Connection.” AmeriCorps program members gathered across the state to collect items and assemble packages to help children create a message for deployed parents or family members.

“Through this United We Serve project, North Carolina’s AmeriCorps members and National Guard have shown that it only takes a small effort to give something back to their communities,” Perdue said. “By serving — we honor those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we build strong families and strong communities all over North Carolina.”

Today, Governor Perdue planted collard greens and cabbages at the Executive Mansion as part of the “Plant a Row for the Hungry” campaign.  Plant a Row (PAR) is a national campaign to encourage all gardeners to grow a little extra produce to donate to the hungry and homeless.  The Raleigh PAR campaign collects produce to donate to the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle.

Gov. Perdue Vetoes Bill That Would Limit Access to Public Records

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday vetoed House Bill 104, “An Act To Clarify Legislative Confidentiality.”

“Transparency and accountability are hallmarks of my administration.  If this legislation became law, documents that are currently public record would become private,” said Perdue.  “Additionally, this bill treats certain state employees unequally.”

The General Assembly passed the legislation on August 10 after making significant changes during the last days of legislative session.

Pursuant to the Constitution, the Governor must call a special session no later than September 20 unless a majority of each house signs a written document stating that there is no need for the session to be convened.

Gov. Perdue Calls for Focus on Prevention as Flu Season Arrives

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday called on North Carolina residents to re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of the school year and the arrival of flu season.

“Parents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,” Perdue said.  “I don’t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.”

Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line of prevention;

- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
- If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
- Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
- If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.
- Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.

Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.

“When a home is foreclosed — it’s bad for our families, it’s bad for our communities, it’s bad for our businesses and it’s bad for North Carolina,” said Perdue.  “This bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.”

Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.

SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.

Consumer tips on home loans, debt collectors and many other topics are available from the Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division at <http://www.ncdoj.gov>www.ncdoj.gov.

Furniture Maker Brings New Plant, 128 Jobs to Alexander County

Caye Home Furnishings, an international manufacturer of custom home furniture, will open a new plant in Taylorsville.  The company plans to invest $1.4 million and create 128 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

“North Carolina, known worldwide for producing fine furniture, continues to be a leading player in this vital manufacturing sector,” Perdue said.  “Our state’s skilled workforce and superb quality of life continue to attract growing companies like Caye Home Furnishings.”

Caye Home Furnishings LLC, headquartered in Mississippi, manufactures living room furniture and case goods including products marketed under the Stratford and Stratolounger name brands.  The company has five manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, Florida, two in China and one in Star, N.C., which opened in August 2008 and employs 52 workers.  The new Taylorsville plant will assemble furniture products to serve that growing market.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $30,142, not including benefits, which is higher than Alexander County’s average annual wage of $27,300.

Keep up the good work!  Especially the vetoes that will prevent the temptation to corrupt in NC government.
We've had enough of that in Washington!

Did you know that the Superintendent of the Blue Ridge Parkway is a North Carolina native. born and bred in Cleveland County (Grover) and graduated from Kings Mountain High School?  He just happens to be my son!  He started his employment at the Kings Mountain Battleground just over the S. C. state line and has worked at Parks all over the country.  He worked at the Great Smokies Park before he was appointed Supt. of the Blue Ridge Parkway.  He also worked for a short time at the Outer Banks park as a temporary Superintendent. 

Thank you for all that you do.

Sincerely,
Jean Francis

> â€œThrough this United We Serve project, North Carolinaâ€™s AmeriCorps members and National Guard have shown that it only takes a small effort to give something back to their communities,â€ Perdue said. â€œBy serving â€” we honor those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we build strong families and strong communities all over North Carolina.â€

> Gov. Perdue Calls for Focus on Prevention as Flu Season Arrives

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday called on North Carolina residents to re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of the school year and the arrival of flu season.

> â€œParents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,â€ Perdue said.  â€œI donâ€™t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.â€

> Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line of prevention;

> - Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
> - If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.
> - Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.
> - Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
> - Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
> - If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.
> - Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.

> Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.

> â€œWhen a home is foreclosed â€” itâ€™s bad for our families, itâ€™s bad for our communities, itâ€™s bad for our businesses and itâ€™s bad for North Carolina,â€ said Perdue.  â€œThis bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.â€

> Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.

> SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.

Please let the governor know that those of us who are true Americans will never recognize 9-11 as a "National Day of Service". This is the day We The People recognize that the foolish policies of liberals in the government under Bill The Perjurer caused our Country to be made vulnerable to attacks from Radical Islamists and remember that our fellow citizens died due to their policies. We mourn the loss of our fellow Americans who died because the Clinton Administration squandered the "Peace Dividend" created by the strong policies of Ronald Wilson Reagan and George H. W. Bush. And yes, I do understand that confronting the truth can be painful.

It provides a complete range of component repair, equipment refurbishment, system retrofits, engineering and parts replacement services with 2,500 workers worldwide. That includes 176 current employees in Rural Hall.
Salaries for the 110 new workers will vary by job function, but the overall average wage will be $45,855 a year, not including benefits. That is higher than the Forsyth County average annual wage of $39,936 without benefits.

9/11 - National Day of Service and Remembrance

Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance and the culmination of the “United We Serve” campaign.  Governor Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet Secretaries, Governor’s Office staff, state government employees and citizens across North Carolina have participated in this campaign to serve others.

Volunteering always is important, but this especially rings true in these tough economic times when so many need so much help.  

On Thursday, Gov. Perdue helped launch “Books on Bases, Smiles on Faces,” a literacy program for military children by Blue Star Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).   She spoke to military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read “Home is Where the Army Sends You” by local author Melissa Davis.  She also helped distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high population of military children.

The Governor also announced that N.C. AmeriCorps members and N.C. National Guard armories have united in a service project to honor military families.  The theme was “Little Heroes Family Connection.” AmeriCorps program members gathered across the state to collect items and assemble packages to help children create a message for deployed parents or family members.

“Through this United We Serve project, North Carolina’s AmeriCorps members and National Guard have shown that it only takes a small effort to give something back to their communities,” Perdue said. “By serving — we honor those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we build strong families and strong communities all over North Carolina.”

Today, Governor Perdue planted collard greens and cabbages at the Executive Mansion as part of the “Plant a Row for the Hungry” campaign.  Plant a Row (PAR) is a national campaign to encourage all gardeners to grow a little extra produce to donate to the hungry and homeless.  The Raleigh PAR campaign collects produce to donate to the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle.

Gov. Perdue Vetoes Bill That Would Limit Access to Public Records

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday vetoed House Bill 104, “An Act To Clarify Legislative Confidentiality.”

“Transparency and accountability are hallmarks of my administration.  If this legislation became law, documents that are currently public record would become private,” said Perdue.  “Additionally, this bill treats certain state employees unequally.”

The General Assembly passed the legislation on August 10 after making significant changes during the last days of legislative session.

Pursuant to the Constitution, the Governor must call a special session no later than September 20 unless a majority of each house signs a written document stating that there is no need for the session to be convened.

Gov. Perdue Calls for Focus on Prevention as Flu Season Arrives

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday called on North Carolina residents to re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of the school year and the arrival of flu season.

“Parents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,” Perdue said.  “I don’t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.”

Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line of prevention;

- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
- If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
- Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
- If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.
- Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.

Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.

“When a home is foreclosed — it’s bad for our families, it’s bad for our communities, it’s bad for our businesses and it’s bad for North Carolina,” said Perdue.  “This bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.”

Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.

SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.

Consumer tips on home loans, debt collectors and many other topics are available from the Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division at <http://www.ncdoj.gov>www.ncdoj.gov.

Furniture Maker Brings New Plant, 128 Jobs to Alexander County

Caye Home Furnishings, an international manufacturer of custom home furniture, will open a new plant in Taylorsville.  The company plans to invest $1.4 million and create 128 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

“North Carolina, known worldwide for producing fine furniture, continues to be a leading player in this vital manufacturing sector,” Perdue said.  “Our state’s skilled workforce and superb quality of life continue to attract growing companies like Caye Home Furnishings.”

Caye Home Furnishings LLC, headquartered in Mississippi, manufactures living room furniture and case goods including products marketed under the Stratford and Stratolounger name brands.  The company has five manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, Florida, two in China and one in Star, N.C., which opened in August 2008 and employs 52 workers.  The new Taylorsville plant will assemble furniture products to serve that growing market.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $30,142, not including benefits, which is higher than Alexander County’s average annual wage of $27,300.

Gov. Perdue Announces 3,514 Arrests During 15th Anniversary "Booze It & Lose It" Campaign

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that state and local law enforcement officers cited 3,514 motorists for driving while impaired during the Labor Day “Booze It & Lose It” campaign, which ran Aug. 21-Sept 7.  A total of 105,370 traffic and criminal citations were issued statewide.

“Law enforcement officers statewide are the key reason this initiative has been so successful over the past 15 years and I commend their continued dedication,” Perdue said.  “Their efforts during this campaign allowed for more families to enjoy the end of summer.”

During the Governor’s Highway Safety Program campaign, officers statewide conducted more than 10,500 sobriety checkpoints and dedicated patrols.  Officers also issued 10,416 safety belt and 1,533 child passenger safety violations, 30,830 speeding violations and 1,819 drug charges. In addition, they apprehended 829 fugitives from justice and recovered 120 stolen vehicles.

I am outraged that  President Obama has taken the tragedy of 9/11 and is trying to make it about his policy.
Commemorating September is about TERRORISM,TRIBUTE, MOURNING and NEVER FORGETTING that America was brutally attacked by EVIL TERRORISTS for NO REASON except that they want to KILL US
I myself and most Americans I know do things everyday to help others and their community, we don't need President Obama to dictate to us as to how to be good citizens and take the focus off what happened on that most horrible day.
I am very disappointed that you would support him on this idea.
SHAME ON YOU.

Please!  We should not celebrate the sacrifices of 9.11 by a "National Day of Service." Would we do the same for December 7th, July 4th, June 6, November 11?  Do not ursurp the importance of these days by "community organizing" them.

9/11 - National Day of Service and Remembrance

Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance and the culmination of the â€œUnited We Serveâ€ campaign.  Governor Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet Secretaries, Governorâ€™s Office staff, state government employees and citizens across North Carolina have participated in this campaign to serve others.
Volunteering always is important, but this especially rings true in these tough economic times when so many need so much help.  
On Thursday, Gov. Perdue helped launch â€œBooks on Bases, Smiles on Faces,â€ a literacy program for military children by Blue Star Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).   She spoke to military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read â€œHome is Where the Army Sends Youâ€ by local author Melissa Davis.  She also helped distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high population of military children.
The Governor also announced that N.C. AmeriCorps members and N.C. National Guard armories have united in a service project to honor military families.  The theme was â€œLittle Heroes Family Connection.â€ AmeriCorps program members gathered across the state to collect items and assemble packages to help children create a message for deployed parents or family members.
â€œThrough this United We Serve project, North Carolinaâ€™s AmeriCorps members and National Guard have shown that it only takes a small effort to give something back to their communities,â€ Perdue said. â€œBy serving â€” we honor those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we build strong families and strong communities all over North Carolina.â€
Today, Governor Perdue planted collard greens and cabbages at the Executive Mansion as part of the â€œPlant a Row for the Hungryâ€ campaign.  Plant a Row (PAR) is a national campaign to encourage all gardeners to grow a little extra produce to donate to the hungry and homeless.  The Raleigh PAR campaign collects produce to donate to the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle.

Gov. Perdue Vetoes Bill That Would Limit Access to Public Records

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday vetoed House Bill 104, â€œAn Act To Clarify Legislative Confidentiality.â€
â€œTransparency and accountability are hallmarks of my administration.  If this legislation became law, documents that are currently public record would become private,â€ said Perdue.  â€œAdditionally, this bill treats certain state employees unequally.â€
The General Assembly passed the legislation on August 10 after making significant changes during the last days of legislative session.
Pursuant to the Constitution, the Governor must call a special session no later than September 20 unless a majority of each house signs a written document stating that there is no need for the session to be convened.

Gov. Perdue Calls for Focus on Prevention as Flu Season Arrives

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday called on North Carolina residents to re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of the school year and the arrival of flu season.
â€œParents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,â€ Perdue said.  â€œI donâ€™t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.â€
Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line of prevention;
- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
- If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
- Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
- If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.
- Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.
For more information about influenza in North Carolina, please visit www.flu.nc.gov. 

Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.
â€œWhen a home is foreclosed â€” itâ€™s bad for our families, itâ€™s bad for our communities, itâ€™s bad for our businesses and itâ€™s bad for North Carolina,â€ said Perdue.  â€œThis bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.â€
Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.
SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.
Consumer tips on home loans, debt collectors and many other topics are available from the Attorney Generalâ€™s Consumer Protection Division at www.ncdoj.gov.

Furniture Maker Brings New Plant, 128 Jobs to Alexander County

Caye Home Furnishings, an international manufacturer of custom home furniture, will open a new plant in Taylorsville.  The company plans to invest $1.4 million and create 128 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
â€œNorth Carolina, known worldwide for producing fine furniture, continues to be a leading player in this vital manufacturing sector,â€ Perdue said.  â€œOur stateâ€™s skilled workforce and superb quality of life continue to attract growing companies like Caye Home Furnishings.â€
Caye Home Furnishings LLC, headquartered in Mississippi, manufactures living room furniture and case goods including products marketed under the Stratford and Stratolounger name brands.  The company has five manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, Florida, two in China and one in Star, N.C., which opened in August 2008 and employs 52 workers.  The new Taylorsville plant will assemble furniture products to serve that growing market.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $30,142, not including benefits, which is higher than Alexander Countyâ€™s average annual wage of $27,300.
For more information about Caye Home Furnishings, visit http://www.cayefurniture.com/.

Gov. Perdue Announces 3,514 Arrests During 15th Anniversary "Booze It & Lose It" Campaign

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that state and local law enforcement officers cited 3,514 motorists for driving while impaired during the Labor Day â€œBooze It & Lose Itâ€ campaign, which ran Aug. 21-Sept 7.  A total of 105,370 traffic and criminal citations were issued statewide.
â€œLaw enforcement officers statewide are the key reason this initiative has been so successful over the past 15 years and I commend their continued dedication,â€ Perdue said.  â€œTheir efforts during this campaign allowed for more families to enjoy the end of summer.â€
During the Governorâ€™s Highway Safety Program campaign, officers statewide conducted more than 10,500 sobriety checkpoints and dedicated patrols.  Officers also issued 10,416 safety belt and 1,533 child passenger safety violations, 30,830 speeding violations and 1,819 drug charges. In addition, they apprehended 829 fugitives from justice and recovered 120 stolen vehicles.

Governor's Office Launches Twitter Page

The Office of Governor Bev Perdue launched a Twitter page to help citizens find the latest news and information from inside the Governorâ€™s Office and administration.
â€œWith only 140 characters, a little bit of twitter can go a long way toward my goal of a transparent, accountable and interactive state govâ€™t,â€ tweeted Perdue.
As part of Gov. Perdueâ€™s emphasis on transparency, accountability and interactivity with the people of North Carolina, she has increased the use of new media. In addition to Twitter, citizens also can follow the Governorâ€™s Office on YouTube, Facebook and Flickr.

TurboCare Announces $30M Expansion in Rural Hall

TurboCare Inc., a subsidiary of Siemens Energy that provides turbomachinery parts and services to companies around the world, will expand its Forsyth County facility, creating 110 jobs and investing $30 million during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $220,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
â€œTurboCareâ€™s expansion is a win for Rural Hall and for North Carolina,â€ Perdue said. â€œThat so many international companies doing business in North Carolina choose to expand here when they have options around the country and around the world shows that our commitments to education, training and a business-friendly environment continue to prove successful.â€
TurboCare offers service solutions in the industrial and power generation markets in more than 100 countries. It provides a complete range of component repair, equipment refurbishment, system retrofits, engineering and parts replacement services with 2,500 workers worldwide. That includes 176 current employees in Rural Hall.
Salaries for the 110 new workers will vary by job function, but the overall average wage will be $45,855 a year, not including benefits. That is higher than the Forsyth County average annual wage of $39,936 without benefits.

You need to drop the "National Day of Service" and quit trying to water down the "National Day of Remembrance"

9/11 has to do with remembering those that perished, our Military men and women, the fireman, police officers, emergency personnel, the families that lost loved ones, all those immediately involved in providing assistance on 9/11. I am really shocked that you buy into this service day crap to water down the true hero's on 9/11.

9/11 - National Day of Service and Remembrance

Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance and the culmination of the “United We Serve” campaign.  Governor Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet Secretaries, Governor’s Office staff, state government employees and citizens across North Carolina have participated in this campaign to serve others.
Volunteering always is important, but this especially rings true in these tough economic times when so many need so much help.  
On Thursday, Gov. Perdue helped launch “Books on Bases, Smiles on Faces,” a literacy program for military children by Blue Star Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).   She spoke to military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read “Home is Where the Army Sends You” by local author Melissa Davis.  She also helped distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high population of military children.
The Governor also announced that N.C. AmeriCorps members and N.C. National Guard armories have united in a service project to honor military families.  The theme was “Little Heroes Family Connection.” AmeriCorps program members gathered across the state to collect items and assemble packages to help children create a message for deployed parents or family members.
“Through this United We Serve project, North Carolina’s AmeriCorps members and National Guard have shown that it only takes a small effort to give something back to their communities,” Perdue said. “By serving — we honor those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we build strong families and strong communities all over North Carolina.”
Today, Governor Perdue planted collard greens and cabbages at the Executive Mansion as part of the “Plant a Row for the Hungry” campaign.  Plant a Row (PAR) is a national campaign to encourage all gardeners to grow a little extra produce to donate to the hungry and homeless.  The Raleigh PAR campaign collects produce to donate to the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle.
Gov. Perdue Vetoes Bill That Would Limit Access to Public Records

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday vetoed House Bill 104, “An Act To Clarify Legislative Confidentiality.”
“Transparency and accountability are hallmarks of my administration.  If this legislation became law, documents that are currently public record would become private,” said Perdue.  “Additionally, this bill treats certain state employees unequally.”
The General Assembly passed the legislation on August 10 after making significant changes during the last days of legislative session.
Pursuant to the Constitution, the Governor must call a special session no later than September 20 unless a majority of each house signs a written document stating that there is no need for the session to be convened.
Gov. Perdue Calls for Focus on Prevention as Flu Season Arrives

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday called on North Carolina residents to re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of the school year and the arrival of flu season.
“Parents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,” Perdue said.  “I don’t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.”
Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line of prevention;
- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
- If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
- Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
- If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.
- Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.

Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.
“When a home is foreclosed — it’s bad for our families, it’s bad for our communities, it’s bad for our businesses and it’s bad for North Carolina,” said Perdue.  “This bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.”
Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.
SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.
Consumer tips on home loans, debt collectors and many other topics are available from the Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division at <http://www.ncdoj.gov>www.ncdoj.gov.
Furniture Maker Brings New Plant, 128 Jobs to Alexander County

Caye Home Furnishings, an international manufacturer of custom home furniture, will open a new plant in Taylorsville.  The company plans to invest $1.4 million and create 128 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
“North Carolina, known worldwide for producing fine furniture, continues to be a leading player in this vital manufacturing sector,” Perdue said.  “Our state’s skilled workforce and superb quality of life continue to attract growing companies like Caye Home Furnishings.”
Caye Home Furnishings LLC, headquartered in Mississippi, manufactures living room furniture and case goods including products marketed under the Stratford and Stratolounger name brands.  The company has five manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, Florida, two in China and one in Star, N.C., which opened in August 2008 and employs 52 workers.  The new Taylorsville plant will assemble furniture products to serve that growing market.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $30,142, not including benefits, which is higher than Alexander County’s average annual wage of $27,300.

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that state and local law enforcement officers cited 3,514 motorists for driving while impaired during the Labor Day “Booze It & Lose It” campaign, which ran Aug. 21-Sept 7.  A total of 105,370 traffic and criminal citations were issued statewide.
“Law enforcement officers statewide are the key reason this initiative has been so successful over the past 15 years and I commend their continued dedication,” Perdue said.  “Their efforts during this campaign allowed for more families to enjoy the end of summer.”
During the Governor’s Highway Safety Program campaign, officers statewide conducted more than 10,500 sobriety checkpoints and dedicated patrols.  Officers also issued 10,416 safety belt and 1,533 child passenger safety violations, 30,830 speeding violations and 1,819 drug charges. In addition, they apprehended 829 fugitives from justice and recovered 120 stolen vehicles.

TurboCare Announces $30M Expansion in Rural Hall

TurboCare Inc., a subsidiary of Siemens Energy that provides turbomachinery parts and services to companies around the world, will expand its Forsyth County facility, creating 110 jobs and investing $30 million during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $220,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
“TurboCare’s expansion is a win for Rural Hall and for North Carolina,” Perdue said. “That so many international companies doing business in North Carolina choose to expand here when they have options around the country and around the world shows that our commitments to education, training and a business-friendly environment continue to prove successful.”

Gov. Perdue Announces the Blue Ridge Parkway to be Honored in U.S. Mint Program

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday announced that the Blue Ridge Parkway will be honored in the new U.S. Mint America the Beautiful Quarters program.  Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner approved the list of sites recommended by the U.S. Mint on Aug. 25, 2009, after consultation with Governor Perdue and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar.

“Countless visitors from around the world have lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway – one of America’s great treasures,” said Perdue. “Now the lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway and its majestic legacy will be captured on these special coins.”
The United States Mint’s America the Beautiful Quarters Program is a 12-year initiative authorized by the America’s Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008.  The act directs the United States Mint to strike and issue 56 circulating quarters with tails side designs emblematic of a national park or other national site in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories — Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands.
The quarters will be issued sequentially each year, in the order in which the featured site was first established as a national park or site.  The coins’ heads side will feature the familiar “restored” 1932 portrait of George Washington, including subtle details and the beauty of the original model.

Governor Perdue,



9-11 is  a day of Reverence instead of service.  This is a day we bow and pray for America and remember 3000 deaths due to Jihad terrorism. 



Everyday  Americans can do voluntary service which we do; millions participate. Please do not mix community service days with days such attached with Pearl Harbor,  WWI Memorials or 9-11 which are somber and serious remembrances of sacrificed lives.



We called and continue to oppose the health care program proposed by President Obama.  NO MORE TAXES!!!!!!  Health reform is necessary and we are relishing the discussion on the proposals by the Republicans if the news channels will ever let us hear them.



Thank you,

Nancy Miller

Clemmons, NC

I am very upset that Service is included with Remembrance - 9/11 people were killed by terrorist and should be remembered on that day of people losing their lives and the real thereat that is still out there, that some people do not want to believe. Service happens everyday of our live when we do good for others!!!

Plant a row for Hunger?? Why do we not stop paying farmers and such to not grow rows of crops so we can feed the hungry in this country. This is going to be a major problem in our State in the neat future because of the lost jobs and people running out of money. We are thinking to much like the people that are running this country now that think that the more money we spend and raise taxes that it will take care of everything? What are you going to do when everyone moves from this state and who are you going to tax now?? Accept more money from the Obama administration? Like we need to pay back more money.  You threatened to take away from schools if we did not raise taxes!! Then you up more spending on things that should have either been cut or not funded at all. Very wise decision on your part?? A true politician.

Keep up the good work!!

9/11 - National Day of Service and Remembrance

Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance and the culmination of the â€œUnited We Serveâ€ campaign.  Governor Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet Secretaries, Governorâ€™s Office staff, state government employees and citizens across North Carolina have participated in this campaign to serve others.

Volunteering always is important, but this especially rings true in these tough economic times when so many need so much help.  

On Thursday, Gov. Perdue helped launch â€œBooks on Bases, Smiles on Faces,â€ a literacy program for military children by Blue Star Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).   She spoke to military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read â€œHome is Where the Army Sends Youâ€ by local author Melissa Davis.  She also helped distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high population of military children.

The Governor also announced that N.C. AmeriCorps members and N.C. National Guard armories have united in a service project to honor military families.  The theme was â€œLittle Heroes Family Connection.â€ AmeriCorps program members gathered across the state to collect items and assemble packages to help children create a message for deployed parents or family members.

â€œThrough this United We Serve project, North Carolinaâ€™s AmeriCorps members and National Guard have shown that it only takes a small effort to give something back to their communities,â€ Perdue said. â€œBy serving â€” we honor those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we build strong families and strong communities all over North Carolina.â€

Today, Governor Perdue planted collard greens and cabbages at the Executive Mansion as part of the â€œPlant a Row for the Hungryâ€ campaign.  Plant a Row (PAR) is a national campaign to encourage all gardeners to grow a little extra produce to donate to the hungry and homeless.  The Raleigh PAR campaign collects produce to donate to the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle.

Gov. Perdue Vetoes Bill That Would Limit Access to Public Records

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday vetoed House Bill 104, â€œAn Act To Clarify Legislative Confidentiality.â€

â€œTransparency and accountability are hallmarks of my administration.  If this legislation became law, documents that are currently public record would become private,â€ said Perdue.  â€œAdditionally, this bill treats certain state employees unequally.â€

The General Assembly passed the legislation on August 10 after making significant changes during the last days of legislative session.

Pursuant to the Constitution, the Governor must call a special session no later than September 20 unless a majority of each house signs a written document stating that there is no need for the session to be convened.

Gov. Perdue Calls for Focus on Prevention as Flu Season Arrives

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday called on North Carolina residents to re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of the school year and the arrival of flu season.

â€œParents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,â€ Perdue said.  â€œI donâ€™t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.â€

Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line of prevention;

- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
- If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
- Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
- If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.
- Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.

Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.

â€œWhen a home is foreclosed â€” itâ€™s bad for our families, itâ€™s bad for our communities, itâ€™s bad for our businesses and itâ€™s bad for North Carolina,â€ said Perdue.  â€œThis bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.â€

Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.

SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.

Consumer tips on home loans, debt collectors and many other topics are available from the Attorney Generalâ€™s Consumer Protection Division at <http://www.ncdoj.gov>www.ncdoj.gov.

Furniture Maker Brings New Plant, 128 Jobs to Alexander County

Caye Home Furnishings, an international manufacturer of custom home furniture, will open a new plant in Taylorsville.  The company plans to invest $1.4 million and create 128 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

â€œNorth Carolina, known worldwide for producing fine furniture, continues to be a leading player in this vital manufacturing sector,â€ Perdue said.  â€œOur stateâ€™s skilled workforce and superb quality of life continue to attract growing companies like Caye Home Furnishings.â€

Caye Home Furnishings LLC, headquartered in Mississippi, manufactures living room furniture and case goods including products marketed under the Stratford and Stratolounger name brands.  The company has five manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, Florida, two in China and one in Star, N.C., which opened in August 2008 and employs 52 workers.  The new Taylorsville plant will assemble furniture products to serve that growing market.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $30,142, not including benefits, which is higher than Alexander Countyâ€™s average annual wage of $27,300.

Gov. Perdue Announces 3,514 Arrests During 15th Anniversary "Booze It & Lose It" Campaign

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that state and local law enforcement officers cited 3,514 motorists for driving while impaired during the Labor Day â€œBooze It & Lose Itâ€ campaign, which ran Aug. 21-Sept 7.  A total of 105,370 traffic and criminal citations were issued statewide.

â€œLaw enforcement officers statewide are the key reason this initiative has been so successful over the past 15 years and I commend their continued dedication,â€ Perdue said.  â€œTheir efforts during this campaign allowed for more families to enjoy the end of summer.â€

During the Governorâ€™s Highway Safety Program campaign, officers statewide conducted more than 10,500 sobriety checkpoints and dedicated patrols.  Officers also issued 10,416 safety belt and 1,533 child passenger safety violations, 30,830 speeding violations and 1,819 drug charges. In addition, they apprehended 829 fugitives from justice and recovered 120 stolen vehicles.

TurboCare Announces $30M Expansion in Rural Hall

TurboCare Inc., a subsidiary of Siemens Energy that provides turbomachinery parts and services to companies around the world, will expand its Forsyth County facility, creating 110 jobs and investing $30 million during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $220,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

â€œTurboCareâ€™s expansion is a win for Rural Hall and for North Carolina,â€ Perdue said. â€œThat so many international companies doing business in North Carolina choose to expand here when they have options around the country and around the world shows that our commitments to education, training and a business-friendly environment continue to prove successful.â€

TurboCare offers service solutions in the industrial and power generation markets in more than 100 countries. It provides a complete range of component repair, equipment refurbishment, system retrofits, engineering and parts replacement services with 2,500 workers worldwide. That includes 176 current employees in Rural Hall.

Salaries for the 110 new workers will vary by job function, but the overall average wage will be $45,855 a year, not including benefits. That is higher than the Forsyth County average annual wage of $39,936 without benefits.

Gov. Perdue Announces the Blue Ridge Parkway to be Honored in U.S. Mint Program

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday announced that the Blue Ridge Parkway will be honored in the new U.S. Mint America the Beautiful Quarters program.  Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner approved the list of sites recommended by the U.S. Mint on Aug. 25, 2009, after consultation with Governor Perdue and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar.

â€œCountless visitors from around the world have lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway â€“ one of Americaâ€™s great treasures,â€ said Perdue. â€œNow the lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway and its majestic legacy will be captured on these special coins.â€

The United States Mintâ€™s America the Beautiful Quarters Program is a 12-year initiative authorized by the Americaâ€™s Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008.  The act directs the United States Mint to strike and issue 56 circulating quarters with tails side designs emblematic of a national park or other national site in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories â€” Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands.

The quarters will be issued sequentially each year, in the order in which the featured site was first established as a national park or site.  The coinsâ€™ heads side will feature the familiar â€œrestoredâ€ 1932 portrait of George Washington, including subtle details and the beauty of the original model.

Please do not call this a "National Day of Service". This is 9/11, a somber day when America was at attacked by Islamic radicals and whom are still waging war on America.

Obama's term" National Day of Service" is disrespectful to this day and has undertones of socialism.


Kind Regards,

James Gartman
President, Graham Independent Group

X-Folder: 9/11-Day of Remembrance not service
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Dear Governor,

With all due respect, 9/11 is a day of reflecting on the tragedy that happened to
this country in 2001, remembering the heroes and victims that died that day, and
remembering that we never want to face a day like that again.  9/11 is NOT a day
of so-called "community service".  Everyday in this country is a day of community
service.  I can name a hundred church, charity, and volunteer groups that cater every
community service from food to the poor....to aid and support to those in other
areas of the world like Africa.  Again, this community service happens everyday.
Therefore, I am offended that you would follow the Presidents shallow, calculated
effort to change what 9/11 really stands for.  This notion that this 9/11 is the first
"national day of community service" really means it's the last day we remember
what 9/11 really stands for. So, please WAKE UP......because this is BS.

Don't misunderstand.  I respect and admire your volunteer initiatives.  However,
they have absolutely nothing to do with 9/11. Let's recognize the day the same
way 9/11 has always been recognized.  Otherwise, which day are we changing
next?  If this President will change the meaning of one historical day...he'll
surely change another.  Hhmmm what could Christmas be?

Thanks You,

Greg Russell

Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance and the culmination of the “United We Serve” campaign.  Governor Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet Secretaries, Governor’s Office staff, state government employees and citizens across North Carolina have participated in this campaign to serve others.
Volunteering always is important, but this especially rings true in these tough economic times when so many need so much help.  
On Thursday, Gov. Perdue helped launch “Books on Bases, Smiles on Faces,” a literacy program for military children by Blue Star Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).   She spoke to military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read “Home is Where the Army Sends You” by local author Melissa Davis.  She also helped distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high population of military children.
The Governor also announced that N.C. AmeriCorps members and N.C. National Guard armories have united in a service project to honor military families.  The theme was “Little Heroes Family Connection.” AmeriCorps program members gathered across the state to collect items and assemble packages to help children create a message for deployed parents or family members.
“Through this United We Serve project, North Carolina’s AmeriCorps members and National Guard have shown that it only takes a small effort to give something back to their communities,” Perdue said. “By serving — we honor those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we build strong families and strong communities all over North Carolina.”
Today, Governor Perdue planted collard greens and cabbages at the Executive Mansion as part of the “Plant a Row for the Hungry” campaign.  Plant a Row (PAR) is a national campaign to encourage all gardeners to grow a little extra produce to donate to the hungry and homeless.  The Raleigh PAR campaign collects produce to donate to the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle.
Gov. Perdue Vetoes Bill That Would Limit Access to Public Records

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday vetoed House Bill 104, “An Act To Clarify Legislative Confidentiality.”
“Transparency and accountability are hallmarks of my administration.  If this legislation became law, documents that are currently public record would become private,” said Perdue.  “Additionally, this bill treats certain state employees unequally.”
The General Assembly passed the legislation on August 10 after making significant changes during the last days of legislative session.
Pursuant to the Constitution, the Governor must call a special session no later than September 20 unless a majority of each house signs a written document stating that there is no need for the session to be convened.
Gov. Perdue Calls for Focus on Prevention as Flu Season Arrives

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday called on North Carolina residents to re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of the school year and the arrival of flu season.
“Parents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,” Perdue said.  “I don’t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.”
Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line of prevention;
- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
- If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
- Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
- If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.
- Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.

Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.
“When a home is foreclosed — it’s bad for our families, it’s bad for our communities, it’s bad for our businesses and it’s bad for North Carolina,” said Perdue.  “This bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.”
Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.
SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.
Consumer tips on home loans, debt collectors and many other topics are available from the Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division at <http://www.ncdoj.gov>www.ncdoj.gov.
Furniture Maker Brings New Plant, 128 Jobs to Alexander County

Caye Home Furnishings, an international manufacturer of custom home furniture, will open a new plant in Taylorsville.  The company plans to invest $1.4 million and create 128 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
“North Carolina, known worldwide for producing fine furniture, continues to be a leading player in this vital manufacturing sector,” Perdue said.  “Our state’s skilled workforce and superb quality of life continue to attract growing companies like Caye Home Furnishings.”
Caye Home Furnishings LLC, headquartered in Mississippi, manufactures living room furniture and case goods including products marketed under the Stratford and Stratolounger name brands.  The company has five manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, Florida, two in China and one in Star, N.C., which opened in August 2008 and employs 52 workers.  The new Taylorsville plant will assemble furniture products to serve that growing market.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $30,142, not including benefits, which is higher than Alexander County’s average annual wage of $27,300.

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that state and local law enforcement officers cited 3,514 motorists for driving while impaired during the Labor Day “Booze It & Lose It” campaign, which ran Aug. 21-Sept 7.  A total of 105,370 traffic and criminal citations were issued statewide.
“Law enforcement officers statewide are the key reason this initiative has been so successful over the past 15 years and I commend their continued dedication,” Perdue said.  “Their efforts during this campaign allowed for more families to enjoy the end of summer.”
During the Governor’s Highway Safety Program campaign, officers statewide conducted more than 10,500 sobriety checkpoints and dedicated patrols.  Officers also issued 10,416 safety belt and 1,533 child passenger safety violations, 30,830 speeding violations and 1,819 drug charges. In addition, they apprehended 829 fugitives from justice and recovered 120 stolen vehicles.

TurboCare Inc., a subsidiary of Siemens Energy that provides turbomachinery parts and services to companies around the world, will expand its Forsyth County facility, creating 110 jobs and investing $30 million during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $220,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

Gov. Perdue Announces the Blue Ridge Parkway to be Honored in U.S. Mint Program

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday announced that the Blue Ridge Parkway will be honored in the new U.S. Mint America the Beautiful Quarters program.  Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner approved the list of sites recommended by the U.S. Mint on Aug. 25, 2009, after consultation with Governor Perdue and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar.

“Countless visitors from around the world have lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway – one of America’s great treasures,” said Perdue. “Now the lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway and its majestic legacy will be captured on these special coins.”
The United States Mint’s America the Beautiful Quarters Program is a 12-year initiative authorized by the America’s Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008.  The act directs the United States Mint to strike and issue 56 circulating quarters with tails side designs emblematic of a national park or other national site in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories — Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands.
The quarters will be issued sequentially each year, in the order in which the featured site was first established as a national park or site.  The coins’ heads side will feature the familiar “restored” 1932 portrait of George Washington, including subtle details and the beauty of the original model.

X-Folder: 9/11-Day of Remembrance not service
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

It is extremely offensive to me that Gov. POerdue would join President Obama in co-opting a day when we should be honoring and remembering those of died Sept. 11th, for a day of service. We don't have a day of service for Pearl harbor Day and 9-11 shouldn't be one eeither. The focus of 9-11 should only be on the victims and our resolve to defeat the Islamic Fasist extremeists.

Gov. Perdue and her administration should be ashamed of themselves for dishonoring the 9-11 victims. Blindly following Obama's lead is why her support if falling thru out the state.

9/11 - National Day of Service and Remembrance

Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance and the culmination of the “United We Serve” campaign.  Governor Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet Secretaries, Governor’s Office staff, state government employees and citizens across North Carolina have participated in this campaign to serve others.
Volunteering always is important, but this especially rings true in these tough economic times when so many need so much help.  
On Thursday, Gov. Perdue helped launch “Books on Bases, Smiles on Faces,” a literacy program for military children by Blue Star Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).   She spoke to military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read “Home is Where the Army Sends You” by local author Melissa Davis.  She also helped distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high population of military children.
The Governor also announced that N.C. AmeriCorps members and N.C. National Guard armories have united in a service project to honor military families.  The theme was “Little Heroes Family Connection.” AmeriCorps program members gathered across the state to collect items and assemble packages to help children create a message for deployed parents or family members.
“Through this United We Serve project, North Carolina’s AmeriCorps members and National Guard have shown that it only takes a small effort to give something back to their communities,” Perdue said. “By serving — we honor those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we build strong families and strong communities all over North Carolina.”
Today, Governor Perdue planted collard greens and cabbages at the Executive Mansion as part of the “Plant a Row for the Hungry” campaign.  Plant a Row (PAR) is a national campaign to encourage all gardeners to grow a little extra produce to donate to the hungry and homeless.  The Raleigh PAR campaign collects produce to donate to the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle.
Gov. Perdue Vetoes Bill That Would Limit Access to Public Records

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday vetoed House Bill 104, “An Act To Clarify Legislative Confidentiality.”
“Transparency and accountability are hallmarks of my administration.  If this legislation became law, documents that are currently public record would become private,” said Perdue.  “Additionally, this bill treats certain state employees unequally.”
The General Assembly passed the legislation on August 10 after making significant changes during the last days of legislative session.
Pursuant to the Constitution, the Governor must call a special session no later than September 20 unless a majority of each house signs a written document stating that there is no need for the session to be convened.
Gov. Perdue Calls for Focus on Prevention as Flu Season Arrives

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday called on North Carolina residents to re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of the school year and the arrival of flu season.
“Parents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,” Perdue said.  “I don’t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.”
Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line of prevention;
- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
- If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
- Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
- If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.
- Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.

Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.
“When a home is foreclosed — it’s bad for our families, it’s bad for our communities, it’s bad for our businesses and it’s bad for North Carolina,” said Perdue.  “This bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.”
Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.
SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.
Consumer tips on home loans, debt collectors and many other topics are available from the Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division at <http://www.ncdoj.gov/>www.ncdoj.gov.
Furniture Maker Brings New Plant, 128 Jobs to Alexander County

Caye Home Furnishings, an international manufacturer of custom home furniture, will open a new plant in Taylorsville.  The company plans to invest $1.4 million and create 128 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
“North Carolina, known worldwide for producing fine furniture, continues to be a leading player in this vital manufacturing sector,” Perdue said.  “Our state’s skilled workforce and superb quality of life continue to attract growing companies like Caye Home Furnishings.”
Caye Home Furnishings LLC, headquartered in Mississippi, manufactures living room furniture and case goods including products marketed under the Stratford and Stratolounger name brands.  The company has five manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, Florida, two in China and one in Star, N.C., which opened in August 2008 and employs 52 workers.  The new Taylorsville plant will assemble furniture products to serve that growing market.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $30,142, not including benefits, which is higher than Alexander County’s average annual wage of $27,300.

Gov. Perdue Announces the Blue Ridge Parkway to be Honored in U.S. Mint Program

Gov.

I  think by calling 9/11 A Day of National Service" is wrong. That is a day to honor and remember the memories of the people who perished that day. If Obama wants a day to call on people for service, let  him use Feb or some other month. Also, we should not be shortening terms of people who rape, vandalize or any other crime.

9/11 - National Day of Service and Remembrance

Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance and the culmination of the “United We Serve” campaign.  Governor Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet Secretaries, Governor’s Office staff, state government employees and citizens across North Carolina have participated in this campaign to serve others.
Volunteering always is important, but this especially rings true in these tough economic times when so many need so much help.  
On Thursday, Gov. Perdue helped launch “Books on Bases, Smiles on Faces,” a literacy program for military children by Blue Star Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).   She spoke to military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read “Home is Where the Army Sends You” by local author Melissa Davis.  She also helped distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high population of military children.
The Governor also announced that N.C. AmeriCorps members and N.C. National Guard armories have united in a service project to honor military families.  The theme was “Little Heroes Family Connection.” AmeriCorps program members gathered across the state to collect items and assemble packages to help children create a message for deployed parents or family members.
“Through this United We Serve project, North Carolina’s AmeriCorps members and National Guard have shown that it only takes a small effort to give something back to their communities,” Perdue said. “By serving — we honor those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we build strong families and strong communities all over North Carolina.”
Today, Governor Perdue planted collard greens and cabbages at the Executive Mansion as part of the “Plant a Row for the Hungry” campaign.  Plant a Row (PAR) is a national campaign to encourage all gardeners to grow a little extra produce to donate to the hungry and homeless.  The Raleigh PAR campaign collects produce to donate to the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle.
Gov. Perdue Vetoes Bill That Would Limit Access to Public Records

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday vetoed House Bill 104, “An Act To Clarify Legislative Confidentiality.”

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

	Dear Governor Perdue, We want to go on record that we disagree with a national day of service on 9/11. This day should be set aside to purely remember those who died due to the most horrible terrorist attack on our nation. We are also very much against a health reform bill that does not include torte reform. I am a nurse in Watauga county and my husband is a Pediatrician. We pay 30% of our income in tax to the federal government and more to state and other taxes. That is more than enough. We feel that legislators treat our hard earned income like play money. My husband told the state government that his previous partner was double billing -when just calling in a prescription, they would bill for an office appointment, too). Nothing was done because this pediatrician was a democrat who was liked by the liberal government. Why don't we deal with the waste and corruption like this, instead of rehauling the entire health care system? I have to be honest and tell you that I think that the Democratic Party is devoid of the presence of the Holy Spirit because abortion-killing of unborn lives- is in their party platform. Dr. and Mrs. Gregory Adams

> 9/11 - National Day of Service and Remembrance

Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance and the culmination of the â€œUnited We Serveâ€ campaign.  Governor Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet Secretaries, Governorâ€™s Office staff, state government employees and citizens across North Carolina have participated in this campaign to serve others.
Volunteering always is important, but this especially rings true in these tough economic times when so many need so much help.  
On Thursday, Gov. Perdue helped launch â€œBooks on Bases, Smiles on Faces,â€ a literacy program for military children by Blue Star Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).   She spoke to military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read â€œHome is Where the Army Sends Youâ€ by local author Melissa Davis.  She also helped distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high population of military children.
The Governor also announced that N.C. AmeriCorps members and N.C. National Guard armories have united in a service project to honor military families.  The theme was â€œLittle Heroes Family Connection.â€ AmeriCorps program members gathered across the state to collect items and assemble packages to help children create a message for deployed parents or family members.
â€œThrough this United We Serve project, North Carolinaâ€™s AmeriCorps members and National Guard have shown that it only takes a small effort to give something back to their communities,â€ Perdue said. â€œBy serving â€” we honor those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we build strong families and strong communities all over North Carolina.â€
Today, Governor Perdue planted collard greens and cabbages at the Executive Mansion as part of the â€œPlant a Row for the Hungryâ€ campaign.  Plant a Row (PAR) is a national campaign to encourage all gardeners to grow a little extra produce to donate to the hungry and homeless.  The Raleigh PAR campaign collects produce to donate to the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle.

Gov. Perdue Vetoes Bill That Would Limit Access to Public Records

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday vetoed House Bill 104, â€œAn Act To Clarify Legislative Confidentiality.â€
â€œTransparency and accountability are hallmarks of my administration.  If this legislation became law, documents that are currently public record would become private,â€ said Perdue.  â€œAdditionally, this bill treats certain state employees unequally.â€
The General Assembly passed the legislation on August 10 after making significant changes during the last days of legislative session.
Pursuant to the Constitution, the Governor must call a special session no later than September 20 unless a majority of each house signs a written document stating that there is no need for the session to be convened.

Gov. Perdue Calls for Focus on Prevention as Flu Season Arrives

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday called on North Carolina residents to re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of the school year and the arrival of flu season.
â€œParents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,â€ Perdue said.  â€œI donâ€™t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.â€
Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line of prevention;
- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
> - If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.
> - Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.
> - Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
> - Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
> - If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.
> - Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.

Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.
â€œWhen a home is foreclosed â€” itâ€™s bad for our families, itâ€™s bad for our communities, itâ€™s bad for our businesses and itâ€™s bad for North Carolina,â€ said Perdue.  â€œThis bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.â€
Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.
SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.
Consumer tips on home loans, debt collectors and many other topics are available from the Attorney Generalâ€™s Consumer Protection Division at <http://www.ncdoj.gov/>www.ncdoj.gov.

> 9/11 - National Day of Service and Remembrance

Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance and the culmination of the â€œUnited We Serveâ€ campaign.  Governor Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet Secretaries, Governorâ€™s Office staff, state government employees and citizens across North Carolina have participated in this campaign to serve others.
Volunteering always is important, but this especially rings true in these tough economic times when so many need so much help.  
On Thursday, Gov. Perdue helped launch â€œBooks on Bases, Smiles on Faces,â€ a literacy program for military children by Blue Star Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).   She spoke to military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read â€œHome is Where the Army Sends Youâ€ by local author Melissa Davis.  She also helped distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high population of military children.
The Governor also announced that N.C. AmeriCorps members and N.C. National Guard armories have united in a service project to honor military families.  The theme was â€œLittle Heroes Family Connection.â€ AmeriCorps program members gathered across the state to collect items and assemble packages to help children create a message for deployed parents or family members.
â€œThrough this United We Serve project, North Carolinaâ€™s AmeriCorps members and National Guard have shown that it only takes a small effort to give something back to their communities,â€ Perdue said. â€œBy serving â€” we honor those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we build strong families and strong communities all over North Carolina.â€
Today, Governor Perdue planted collard greens and cabbages at the Executive Mansion as part of the â€œPlant a Row for the Hungryâ€ campaign.  Plant a Row (PAR) is a national campaign to encourage all gardeners to grow a little extra produce to donate to the hungry and homeless.  The Raleigh PAR campaign collects produce to donate to the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle.

Gov. Perdue Vetoes Bill That Would Limit Access to Public Records

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday vetoed House Bill 104, â€œAn Act To Clarify Legislative Confidentiality.â€
â€œTransparency and accountability are hallmarks of my administration.  If this legislation became law, documents that are currently public record would become private,â€ said Perdue.  â€œAdditionally, this bill treats certain state employees unequally.â€
The General Assembly passed the legislation on August 10 after making significant changes during the last days of legislative session.
Pursuant to the Constitution, the Governor must call a special session no later than September 20 unless a majority of each house signs a written document stating that there is no need for the session to be convened.

Gov. Perdue Calls for Focus on Prevention as Flu Season Arrives

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday called on North Carolina residents to re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of the school year and the arrival of flu season.
â€œParents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,â€ Perdue said.  â€œI donâ€™t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.â€
Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line of prevention;
- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
> - If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.
> - Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.
> - Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
> - Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
> - If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.
> - Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.

Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.
â€œWhen a home is foreclosed â€” itâ€™s bad for our families, itâ€™s bad for our communities, itâ€™s bad for our businesses and itâ€™s bad for North Carolina,â€ said Perdue.  â€œThis bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.â€
Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.
SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday called on North Carolina residents to re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of the school year and the arrival of flu season.

> â€œParents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,â€ Perdue said.  â€œI donâ€™t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.â€

> Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.

> â€œWhen a home is foreclosed â€” itâ€™s bad for our families, itâ€™s bad for our communities, itâ€™s bad for our businesses and itâ€™s bad for North Carolina,â€ said Perdue.  â€œThis bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.â€

> Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.

> SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.

> Consumer tips on home loans, debt collectors and many other topics are available from the Attorney Generalâ€™s Consumer Protection Division at <http://www.ncdoj.gov>www.ncdoj.gov.

> Furniture Maker Brings New Plant, 128 Jobs to Alexander County

Caye Home Furnishings, an international manufacturer of custom home furniture, will open a new plant in Taylorsville.  The company plans to invest $1.4 million and create 128 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

> â€œNorth Carolina, known worldwide for producing fine furniture, continues to be a leading player in this vital manufacturing sector,â€ Perdue said.  â€œOur stateâ€™s skilled workforce and superb quality of life continue to attract growing companies like Caye Home Furnishings.â€

> Caye Home Furnishings LLC, headquartered in Mississippi, manufactures living room furniture and case goods including products marketed under the Stratford and Stratolounger name brands.  The company has five manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, Florida, two in China and one in Star, N.C., which opened in August 2008 and employs 52 workers.  The new Taylorsville plant will assemble furniture products to serve that growing market.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $30,142, not including benefits, which is higher than Alexander Countyâ€™s average annual wage of $27,300.

The Honorable Governor Purdue.

Your decision to follow in political rhetoric of the current administration to declare Sept. 11th as a day of community volunteerism is truly disturbing.  September 11th in no way should be made  political or a means of advancing community activism from a community organizer.  We were attacked, thousands
lost their lives. This government has forgotten that. Government, both state and local politicians have forgotten who they represent. I feel they have forsaken those that pay for all the services that they provide. Our last legislative session and you proved that politicians truly believe taxes are the answer. Citizens that work to provide for their families must also provide for the whims of power grabbers and politicians.  The most abundant wells eventually go dry.

Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.
SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.
Consumer tips on home loans, debt collectors and many other topics are available from the Attorney Generalâ€™s Consumer Protection Division at <http://www.ncdoj.gov/>www.ncdoj.gov.

Furniture Maker Brings New Plant, 128 Jobs to Alexander County

Caye Home Furnishings, an international manufacturer of custom home furniture, will open a new plant in Taylorsville.  The company plans to invest $1.4 million and create 128 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
â€œNorth Carolina, known worldwide for producing fine furniture, continues to be a leading player in this vital manufacturing sector,â€ Perdue said.  â€œOur stateâ€™s skilled workforce and superb quality of life continue to attract growing companies like Caye Home Furnishings.â€
Caye Home Furnishings LLC, headquartered in Mississippi, manufactures living room furniture and case goods including products marketed under the Stratford and Stratolounger name brands.  The company has five manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, Florida, two in China and one in Star, N.C., which opened in August 2008 and employs 52 workers.  The new Taylorsville plant will assemble furniture products to serve that growing market.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $30,142, not including benefits, which is higher than Alexander Countyâ€™s average annual wage of $27,300.

Gov. Perdue Announces the Blue Ridge Parkway to be Honored in U.S. Mint Program

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday announced that the Blue Ridge Parkway will be honored in the new U.S. Mint America the Beautiful Quarters program.  Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner approved the list of sites recommended by the U.S. Mint on Aug. 25, 2009, after consultation with Governor Perdue and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar.

> â€œCountless visitors from around the world have lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway â€“ one of Americaâ€™s great treasures,â€ said Perdue. â€œNow the lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway and its majestic legacy will be captured on these special coins.â€
The United States Mintâ€™s America the Beautiful Quarters Program is a 12-year initiative authorized by the Americaâ€™s Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008.  The act directs the United States Mint to strike and issue 56 circulating quarters with tails side designs emblematic of a national park or other national site in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories â€” Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands.
The quarters will be issued sequentially each year, in the order in which the featured site was first established as a national park or site.  The coinsâ€™ heads side will feature the familiar â€œrestoredâ€ 1932 portrait of George Washington, including subtle details and the beauty of the original model.

Ms Perdue, A Day of Remembrance, NOT, a day of service. Please stop hooking your anchor to Obama.

I worked at College Park MD, the day terrorists decided to turn the United States into a war zone. My wife was working for the MITRE Corporation in McLean VA. My oldest son worked in Crystal City, 1 1/2 miles from the Pentagon, we also had a 10th story apartment in Crystal City, one block from the Pentagon. I cannot forget the gut wrenching nausea and panic we felt while talking to my son as he jogged 2-3 miles home following the explosion of the aircraft hitting the Pentagon because the city was completely shut down and vehicle traffic was not allowed in or out. He and his fellow workers watched the aftermath of the carnage from a conference room, which happened to over look the Pentagon. I'll not ever forget the 48 hours of wailing sirens and the horrible stench of the burning building, bodies, and jet fuel. Many of us will never be the same, or look at this world through your rose colored glasses of service. All we need to do on the anniversary of this despicable tragedy is fly an American Flag, say many prayers for those not only killed that day, their loved ones left behind, and those who continue to support our Military so that we can live with a continued peace of mind knowing that if we keep the war away from us another 3,000 people won't be killed by some whacked out zealots. The "Day of Service", suggested by a President that was nowhere near the tragedy or remotely affected by it, is a travesty.

You, as an American,  need to do the same thing.... fly a flag, say a prayer, and thank a Military member for their service. A day of service "for the State", what an insult!! You are really treading on thin ice and I will personally see that you are voted out in the next election, if not sooner. You held off your budget while counties figured theirs. Then you "saved money" by dumping State programs on the counties. Wind and Hail costs are bankrupting the average homeowners, while insurance companies and your pool is growing. Your moving the School lottery money to the general fund to cover other costs is illegal and despicable, while you make false moves to boost our education systems. When, by the way, are you going to address the $15 billion, of future retirement for all those "poor" teachers and State employees that cried the blues over a 1/2 % pay decrease. When, when Ms Perdue? You, like the President, talk a good game; however, you lack truth, substance, and reality. Where did the money go during the good years? You don't know? Gee, sorry I asked. Silly me.

|      Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance |
|      and the culmination of the â€œUnited We Serveâ€ campaign.Â  Governor    |
|      Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet [IMAGE]Secretaries,          |
|      Governorâ€™s Office staff, state government employees and citizens    |

|      VolunteeringÂ always is important, butÂ this especiallyÂ rings true in |
|      these tough economic times when so many need so much help.          |
|                                                                          |
|      On Thursday, Gov.Perdue helped launch â€œBooks on Bases, Smiles on    |
|      Faces,â€ a literacy program for military children by Blue Star       |
|      Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).Â Â  She spoke to|
|      military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read â€œHome is Where  |
|      the Army Sends Youâ€ by local author Melissa Davis.Â  She also helped |
|      distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high       |
|      population of military children.                                    |
|                                                                          |
|      [IMAGE]The Governor also announced thatÂ N.C.AmeriCorps members      |
|      andÂ N.C.National Guard armories have united in a service project to |
|      honor military families.Â  The theme was â€œLittle Heroes Family       |
|      Connection.â€ AmeriCorps program members gathered across the state to|
|      collect items and assemble packages to help children create a       |
|      message for deployed parents or family members.                     |
|                                                                          |
|      â€œThrough this United We Serve project, North Carolinaâ€™s AmeriCorps  |
|      members and National Guard have shown that it only takes a small    |
|      effort to give something back to their communities,â€ Perdue said.   |
|      â€œBy serving â€” we honor those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we   |
|      [IMAGE]build strong families and strong communities all over North  |
|      Carolina.â€                                                          |

|      Today, Governor Perdue planted collardgreensÂ and cabbages at the    |
|      Executive Mansion as part of the â€œPlant a Row for the Hungryâ€       |
|      campaign.Â  Plant a Row (PAR) is a national campaign to encourage all|
|      gardeners to grow a little extra produce to donate to the hungry and|
|      homeless.Â  The Raleigh PAR campaign collects produce to donate to   |
|      the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle.                                       |

|      Gov. Bev PerdueÂ on ThursdayÂ vetoed House Bill 104, â€œAn Act To       |
|      Clarify Legislative Confidentiality.â€                               |
|                                                                          |
|      â€œTransparency and accountability are hallmarks of my                |
|      administration.Â  If this legislation became law, documents that are |
|      currently public record would become private,â€ said Perdue.         |
|      â€œAdditionally, this bill treats certain state employees unequally.â€ |
|                                                                          |
|      The General Assembly passed the legislation on August 10 after      |
|      making significant changes during the last days of legislative      |
|      session.                                                            |

|      Pursuant to the Constitution, the Governor must call a special      |
|      session no later than September 20 unless a majority of each house  |
|      signs a written document stating that there is no need for the      |
|      session to be convened.                                             |
|                                                                          |

|      Gov. Bev PerdueÂ on TuesdayÂ called on North Carolina residents to    |
|      re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the|
|      number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of|
|      the school year and the arrival of flu season.                      |
|                                                                          |
|      [IMAGE]â€œParents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal|
|      flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing   |
|      good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,â€ Perdue said.Â  â€œI donâ€™t|
|      want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North    |
|      Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.â€                            |
|                                                                          |
|      Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line  |
|      of prevention;                                                      |
|                                                                          |
|      - Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. |
|      Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.                     |
|      - If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper       |
|      sleeve, not your hands.                                             |
|      - Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you   |
|      cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.    |
|      - Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.   |
|      - Try to avoid close contact with sick people.                      |
|      - If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and  |
|      limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.            |
|      - Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it     |
|      becomes available.                                                  |

|      Gov. Bev PerdueÂ on WednesdayÂ signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer   |
|      Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners  |
|      facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from|
|      unfair debt collectors.                                             |

|      bad for our communities, itâ€™s bad for our businesses and itâ€™s bad   |
|      for North Carolina,â€ said Perdue.Â  â€œThis bill makes it easier for   |

|      Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone|
|      into foreclosure so far in 2009.Â  According to the Center for       |
|      Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners|
|      will see their property values decline over the next three years    |
|      because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.Â  Foreclosures hurt   |
|      lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan   |
|      value.                                                              |

|      SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure     |
|      hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and|
|      to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and   |
|      lenders more time to negotiate a solution.                          |

At times, words fail me.  

I guess the President DID say we are not a Christian nation.......

The source sending me this information adds:

On September 25th there will be a national prayer
gathering of Muslims on the west front of the U.S. Capitol Building.  

They are expecting at least 50,000 to attend from mosques all across
America. They will gather to pray from 4:00 AM until 7:00 PM. The gathering
will take place by the site where U.S. Presidents have been inaugurated
since 1981.  

The organizers say that it was Obama's inauguration speech in
January and his speech broadcast from Egypt in June that gave them the idea
for this prayer gathering on Capitol Hill. "

9/11 - National Day of Service and Remembrance

Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance and the culmination of the “United We Serve” campaign.  Governor Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet <http://gfx1.hotmail.com/mail/w3/ltr/i_safe.gif>Secretaries, Governor’s Office staff, state government employees and citizens across North Carolina have participated in this campaign to serve others.
Volunteering always is important, but this especially rings true in these tough economic times when so many need so much help.  
On Thursday, Gov. Perdue helped launch “Books on Bases, Smiles on Faces,” a literacy program for military children by Blue Star Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).   She spoke to military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read “Home is Where the Army Sends You” by local author Melissa Davis.  She also helped distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high population of military children.
<http://gfx1.hotmail.com/mail/w3/ltr/i_safe.gif>The Governor also announced that N.C. AmeriCorps members and N.C. National Guard armories have united in a service project to honor military families.  The theme was “Little Heroes Family Connection.” AmeriCorps program members gathered across the state to collect items and assemble packages to help children create a message for deployed parents or family members.
“Through this United We Serve project, North Carolina’s AmeriCorps members and National Guard have shown that it only takes a small effort to give something back to their communities,” Perdue said. “By serving — we honor those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we <http://gfx1.hotmail.com/mail/w3/ltr/i_safe.gif>build strong families and strong communities all over North Carolina.”
Today, Governor Perdue planted collard greens and cabbages at the Executive Mansion as part of the “Plant a Row for the Hungry” campaign.  Plant a Row (PAR) is a national campaign to encourage all gardeners to grow a little extra produce to donate to the hungry and homeless.  The Raleigh PAR campaign collects produce to donate to the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle.
Gov. Perdue Vetoes Bill That Would Limit Access to Public Records

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday vetoed House Bill 104, “An Act To Clarify Legislative Confidentiality.”
“Transparency and accountability are hallmarks of my administration.  If this legislation became law, documents that are currently public record would become private,” said Perdue.  “Additionally, this bill treats certain state employees unequally.”
The General Assembly passed the legislation on August 10 after making significant changes during the last days of legislative session.
Pursuant to the Constitution, the Governor must call a special session no later than September 20 unless a majority of each house signs a written document stating that there is no need for the session to be convened.
Gov. Perdue Calls for Focus on Prevention as Flu Season Arrives

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday called on North Carolina residents to re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of the school year and the arrival of flu season.
<http://gfx1.hotmail.com/mail/w3/ltr/i_safe.gif>“Parents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,” Perdue said.  “I don’t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.”
Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line of prevention;
- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
- If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
- Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
- If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.
- Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.

Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.
<http://gfx1.hotmail.com/mail/w3/ltr/i_safe.gif>“When a home is foreclosed — it’s bad for our families, it’s bad for our communities, it’s bad for our businesses and it’s bad for North Carolina,” said Perdue.  “This bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.”
Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.
SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.
Consumer tips on home loans, debt collectors and many other topics are available from the Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division at www.ncdoj.gov.
Furniture Maker Brings New Plant, 128 Jobs to Alexander County

Caye Home Furnishings, an international manufacturer of custom home furniture, will open a new plant in Taylorsville.  The company plans to invest $1.4 million and create 128 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
<http://gfx1.hotmail.com/mail/w3/ltr/i_safe.gif>“North Carolina, known worldwide for producing fine furniture, continues to be a leading player in this vital manufacturing sector,” Perdue said.  “Our state’s skilled workforce and superb quality of life continue to attract growing companies like Caye Home Furnishings.”
Caye Home Furnishings LLC, headquartered in Mississippi, manufactures living room furniture and case goods including products marketed under the Stratford and Stratolounger name brands.  The company has five manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, Florida, two in China and one in Star, N.C., which opened in August 2008 and employs 52 workers.  The new Taylorsville plant will assemble furniture products to serve that growing market.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $30,142, not including benefits, which is higher than Alexander County’s average annual wage of $27,300.

Gov. Perdue Announces 3,514 Arrests During 15th Anniversary "Booze It & Lose It" Campaign

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that state and local law enforcement officers cited 3,514 motorists for driving while impaired during the Labor Day “Booze It & Lose It” campaign, which ran Aug. 21-Sept 7.  A total of 105,370 traffic and criminal citations were issued statewide.
“Law enforcement officers statewide are the key reason this initiative has been so successful over the past 15 years and I commend their continued dedication,” Perdue said.  “Their efforts during this campaign allowed for more families to enjoy the end of summer.”
During the Governor’s Highway Safety Program campaign, officers statewide conducted more than 10,500 sobriety checkpoints and dedicated patrols.  Officers also issued 10,416 safety belt and 1,533 child passenger safety violations, 30,830 speeding violations and 1,819 drug charges. In addition, they apprehended 829 fugitives from justice and recovered 120 stolen vehicles.

Governor's Office Launches Twitter Page

The Office of Governor Bev Perdue launched a Twitter page to help citizens find the latest news and information from inside the Governor’s Office and administration.
<http://gfx1.hotmail.com/mail/w3/ltr/i_safe.gif>“With only 140 characters, a little bit of twitter can go a long way toward my goal of a transparent, accountable and interactive state gov’t,” tweeted Perdue.
As part of Gov. Perdue’s emphasis on transparency, accountability and interactivity with the people of North Carolina, she has increased the use of new media. In addition to Twitter, citizens also can follow the Governor’s Office on YouTube,  Facebook and Flickr.
TurboCare Announces $30M Expansion in Rural Hall

TurboCare Inc., a subsidiary of Siemens Energy that provides turbomachinery parts and services to companies around the world, will expand its Forsyth County facility, creating 110 jobs and investing $30 million during the next three years.  The announcement was made <http://gfx1.hotmail.com/mail/w3/ltr/i_safe.gif>possible in part by a $220,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
“TurboCare’s expansion is a win for Rural Hall and for North Carolina,” Perdue said. “That so many international companies doing business in North Carolina choose to expand here when they have options around the country and around the world shows that our commitments to education, training and a business-friendly environment continue to prove successful.”
TurboCare offers service solutions in the industrial and power generation markets in more than 100 countries. It provides a complete range of component repair, equipment refurbishment, system retrofits, engineering and parts replacement services with 2,500 workers worldwide.

Gov. Perdue Announces the Blue Ridge Parkway to be Honored in U.S. Mint Program

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday announced that the Blue Ridge Parkway will be honored in the new U.S. Mint America the Beautiful Quarters program.  Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner approved the list of sites recommended by the U.S. Mint on Aug. 25, 2009, after consultation with Governor Perdue and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar.

“Countless visitors from around the world have lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway – one of America’s great treasures,” said Perdue. “Now the lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway and its majestic legacy will be captured on these special coins.”
The United States Mint’s America the Beautiful Quarters Program is a 12-year initiative authorized by the America’s Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008.  The act directs the United States Mint to strike and issue 56 circulating quarters with tails side designs emblematic of a national park or other national site in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories — Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands.
The quarters will be issued sequentially each year, in the order in which the featured site was first established as a national park or site.  The coins’ heads side will feature the familiar “restored” 1932 portrait of George Washington, including subtle details and the beauty of the original model.
To view the complete National Site Registry, which lists all 56 sites to be honored under the U.S. Mint’s America the Beautiful Quarters Program in chronological order by year, please visit  www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/NSQuartersProgram/?action=siteRegister.

	The Director's Corner

<http://origin.ih.constantcontact.com/fs080/1101937742643/img/98.jpg?a=1102696909204> For more than a decade, health professions pipeline work has been my passion. During my tenure with NC-HCAP, I have enjoyed working with students committed to becoming health care professionals and colleagues committed to helping them achieve their goals. The added bonus is that I have been able to so right here at UNC, my alma mater.

After 14 years at UNC, I leave to begin serving as the Assistant Vice President of Academic Affairs at Langston University. Although I am excited about this new venture, I will truly miss this great institution, an outstanding organization, wonderful colleagues and fantastic students.

I want to thank all of you for your unwavering support. We have been able to do what we do because of your belief in our mission and your desire to see our state grow a more diversified health care work force.  It has been my pleasure to serve you, the university and the state at large. Homecoming will mean even more to me now.

Patrena N. Benton, Ph.D.
Director


<http://origin.ih.constantcontact.com/fs080/1101937742643/img/109.jpg?a=1102696909204>From the Interim Director:

I am excited to serve as Interim Director for NC-HCAP and hope to follow in the footsteps of administrators who have provided outstanding leadership over the years.

On behalf of the NC-HCAP team, we thank you -- students, alumni, colleagues and friends -- for allowing us to be a part of your lives. We look forward to a continued relationship.

9/11 - National Day of Service and Remembrance

Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance and the culmination of the â€œUnited We Serveâ€ campaign.  Governor Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet Secretaries, Governorâ€™s Office staff, state government employees and citizens across North Carolina have participated in this campaign to serve others.
Volunteering always is important, but this especially rings true in these tough economic times when so many need so much help.  
On Thursday, Gov. Perdue helped launch â€œBooks on Bases, Smiles on Faces,â€ a literacy program for military children by Blue Star Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).   She spoke to military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read â€œHome is Where the Army Sends Youâ€ by local author Melissa Davis.  She also helped distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high population of military children.
The Governor also announced that N.C. AmeriCorps members and N.C. National Guard armories have united in a service project to honor military families.  The theme was â€œLittle Heroes Family Connection.â€ AmeriCorps program members gathered across the state to collect items and assemble packages to help children create a message for deployed parents or family members.
â€œThrough this United We Serve project, North Carolinaâ€™s AmeriCorps members and National Guard have shown that it only takes a small effort to give something back to their communities,â€ Perdue said. â€œBy serving â€” we honor those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we build strong families and strong communities all over North Carolina.â€
Today, Governor Perdue planted collard greens and cabbages at the Executive Mansion as part of the â€œPlant a Row for the Hungryâ€ campaign.  Plant a Row (PAR) is a national campaign to encourage all gardeners to grow a little extra produce to donate to the hungry and homeless.  The Raleigh PAR campaign collects produce to donate to the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle.

Gov. Perdue Vetoes Bill That Would Limit Access to Public Records

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday vetoed House Bill 104, â€œAn Act To Clarify Legislative Confidentiality.â€
â€œTransparency and accountability are hallmarks of my administration.  If this legislation became law, documents that are currently public record would become private,â€ said Perdue.  â€œAdditionally, this bill treats certain state employees unequally.â€
The General Assembly passed the legislation on August 10 after making significant changes during the last days of legislative session.
Pursuant to the Constitution, the Governor must call a special session no later than September 20 unless a majority of each house signs a written document stating that there is no need for the session to be convened.

Gov. Perdue Calls for Focus on Prevention as Flu Season Arrives

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday called on North Carolina residents to re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of the school year and the arrival of flu season.
â€œParents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,â€ Perdue said.  â€œI donâ€™t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.â€
Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line of prevention;
- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
- If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
- Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
- If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.
- Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.

Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.
â€œWhen a home is foreclosed â€” itâ€™s bad for our families, itâ€™s bad for our communities, itâ€™s bad for our businesses and itâ€™s bad for North Carolina,â€ said Perdue.  â€œThis bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.â€
Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.
SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.
Consumer tips on home loans, debt collectors and many other topics are available from the Attorney Generalâ€™s Consumer Protection Division at <http://www.ncdoj.gov/>www.ncdoj.gov.

Subject: 30th Brigade Soldier Seeks Governors Help

Comment: Thank you for taking the time to read this. My name is Sergeant Steven Ferguson. I am currently deployed with the 30th Brigade in Southern Baghdad, Iraq. I am in the 230th Brigade Support Battalion, but currently working in the Convoy Security Company, also in the 230th. During the mobilization process to come to Iraq, my Brigade went to the National Training Center, just outside Barstow, CA. After arriving there, I received the word from my mother, that my wife, of 9 months, was in labor pains and was heading to UNC hospital. I booked and paid for a flight on March 12, 2009. My commander instructed me that the Army had a paternity regulation, that allowed Active Army soldiers 10 non-chargable days of leave to be with their spouse. Under that regulation, I received 10 days of leave, and luckily made it back to NC to see my first daughter be born on March 13th of this year. I would also like to mention, that I am a soldier that is under the Stop-Loss policy. I completed my military contract on Dec 19th, 2008. I was ordered to deploy however, and have served 8 months of Active service over my military contract. Once arriving in Iraq in early May 2009, I was told that I would not get my 14 days of leave to go home, because I had taken 10 days in March for the birth of my daughter. My First Sergeant has tried multiple times to get an answer on why this is, but has no success as of today. He went as far as to file an IG complaint for this very reason, only to be told to stand down. I have come to learn that the IG component on my location, is also under investigation from Division, because of the denial of complaints for leave. This has led me to you, and I consider this my last option. I have served proudly in Iraq once prior to this deployment. I have never seen such poor leadership in command in my entire 7 year military experience. The Farewell Ceremony was only the beginning for us. Other soldiers that received Emergency leave just as I did, such as my current Battalion Sergeant Major, have been told they will allow them to take their leave. I find this very unfair and have no outlet to turn to for help but to you. I informed my 1SG that would email and contact you, and he agreed with me 100%. I am an American soldier, and can honestly deal with unfairness in this unit, as I have before. However, this is affecting my family as well as myself. I would appreciate any response you may give, and hope you will help in any way. Thank you for your time. SGT Steven Ferguson

> 9/11 - National Day of Service and Remembrance

Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance and the culmination of the “United We Serve” campaign.  Governor Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet Secretaries, Governor’s Office staff, state government employees and citizens across North Carolina have participated in this campaign to serve others.

> Volunteering always is important, but this especially rings true in these tough economic times when so many need so much help.  

> On Thursday, Gov. Perdue helped launch “Books on Bases, Smiles on Faces,” a literacy program for military children by Blue Star Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).   She spoke to military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read “Home is Where the Army Sends You” by local author Melissa Davis.  She also helped distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high population of military children.

> The Governor also announced that N.C. AmeriCorps members and N.C. National Guard armories have united in a service project to honor military families.  The theme was “Little Heroes Family Connection.” AmeriCorps program members gathered across the state to collect items and assemble packages to help children create a message for deployed parents or family members.

Dear Mr. Hinson,



Governor Perdue’s office has requested that I respond to your recent correspondence regarding your North Carolina driving record. 



North Carolina General Statutes require the Division to post motor vehicle related convictions to one’s driving record upon receipt from the court.  The laws also mandate the action that is taken against one’s driving privileges.



You should petition the Courts in the Counties in which you were charged or convicted for information related to the expunction of any offenses you have received.



If I can assist you in other matters of mutual interest, feel free to let me know.

Subject: concerned

Comment: To Whom It May Concern: My name is Jason Hinson. I am an Operation Iraqi freedom Veteran. From the ages of 16 to 23 I made some very poor choices. Not only did I make those poor choices, but now those choices I made are affecting my life. At the time, as a young and very immature teen, I did not think of my future, I only thought of the moment. I continued along a path that could very easily have caused me to go to jail, or kill someone. On or around 05 April 2003 I once again made another bad choice. I got pulled over and got charged with DWI. The very next day I was down on my self. That day happened to be Sunday. So as I tried to do normally, I went to church. That Sunday was different than any other. It was a day for change, a day of forgiveness, a day for Salvation. I asked Jesus to come in my heart on that day, not because I felt bad for getting caught doing what I continued to do, but because I was SICK of being that person. Not that I was a criminal, but I was on my way to no where. God saved me that day. That means he forgave me and changed me from who I was to who I am now. Months later I decided to join the North Carolina Army National Guard. I knew the price; I knew that I could end up going to Iraq. But I did it any way, because I wanted to better myself, and make up for the mistakes I have made. I am proud of my 6 years in the military, and don’t regret serving my country. It has now been 6 years since my DWI. I have been waiting this long to get sponsored from a Law Enforcement Agency so I can take BLET. And now, I am having a problem because I have more than 4 misdemeanors, all are alcohol related, and it looks bad. I am no criminal, I made some bad choices, and got caught. I don’t know the beliefs of the person(s) reading this letter. But when I asked God to forgive me, he did. And those mistakes to him are now in the past, never to be brought back on me again. Why can’t the world be that way? No one is perfect. We shouldn’t let the mistakes we make, or others make, hold us back from the goals we have in our lives. I hope this reaches some one who understands where I am coming from, and looks beyond who I was, and now looks to who I am. My dream of being a Law Enforcement Officer, should not be denied because of misdemeanors such as position of alcohol underage. I would understand if it was a felony or another more serious crime. Please help me to achieve my goal. Sincerely, Jason M. Hinson Jasonhinson51@yahoo.com (704)292-8305

 California Courts Closing Its Doors



Today is September 14. In just two days all of the courts in the State of California will be closing. Our California judicial system is in total shambles, while the judges are prospering. They can now sit along their pool side with lemonade while they collect not only their full salary, but an additional $46,000.



During the last two decades of the California courts an appellate court has found that the Los Angeles County judges have been taking $46,000 in annual County bribes. This payoff of the judges by the County of Los Angeles has influenced their decisions whenever the County of Los Angeles has been a party to an action. In fact, Attorney Fredrick Bennett, who was assigned to all cases involving judges, has boasted that in all his years he has never lost a case wherein a judge was called into account. I, Ron Branson, testify that when I appeared in federal court as a plaintiff against a Los Angeles judge, Mr. Bennett would sport with the judge in my presence prior to the case proceeding. His conversation, my not remembering the names, went as follows; “How is your wife Helen? How is your son, Johnnie and your daughter Mary?” This was his manner of letting me know that he has an intimate relationship with the federal judge as though having picnicked with the family last Saturday. In effect, he was laughing at me over the very idea that I would seek to hold a Los Angeles  judge accountable.



Economically, the chickens are coming home to roost, and now the courts are facing financial turmoil and having to close. For those of you not familiar with the judicial system here in California, the author of the below article is California Chief Justice Ronald George. I was called by the Los Angeles Times, and on the other end was Reporter Jessica Garrison. She asked me, “Do you know who Ronald George is?” I said yes, he is the Chief Justice of California. She said, “That’s correct. I just got off the phone with Ronald George and he says he knows you.” I said to her, I’m very impressed, but he has nothing good to say about me. She said, “That is correct.” I then told her that Ronald George has said in the media that I am out to destroy this “wonderful judicial system” we have here in California.



She asked me if I would meet with her for an interview. I told her yes, and I met her at Sitton’s Restaurant. She was quite a serious person, and during that interview I decided to enter a little humor. I said to her, “I’m going to call Ronald George and arrange for lunch with him.” She asked, “Why would you do that?” I to her  “You said that Ronald George knows me, so I thought we should get together and discuss getting JAIL4Judges passed here in California.” She did not crack a smile.



Anyway, below you will see Ronald George mourning the closures of his courts throughout California. He has entitled it, “Justice Takes a Day Off.” If it is any consolation to him, I am here announcing J.A.I.L.’s goal to post the Judicial Accountability Initiative Law on our California Secretary of State’s website, and the endeavor to place Judicial Accountability on the California ballot in California for November, 2010. Ronald George’s help in this endeavor will be appreciated. We know this news will spread across this nation very fast.



Enjoy as you read the words of my dear ole’ friend, Chief Justice Ronald George. He was kind enough to write about me in his State of the Judiciary message for 2007, so if you care to write him, tell him Ron Branson sent ya.

In California, justice takes a day off

The state's chief justice says shutting down the courts one day a month will be a burden -- and a test of our ability to deal with fiscal crisis.

·Related



By Ronald M. George

September 14, 2009



Starting Sept. 16, the largest court system in the nation will be closing the doors of courthouses across the state one day each month. On Wednesday, an estimated 3 million cases will be delayed, 150 jury trials interrupted and 250 child custody cases unheard. Jails will be more crowded as arraignment and release dates are postponed; attorneys and their clients will be inconvenienced, as will jurors; and the public will experience longer lines, more delays and more crowded courtrooms.

Wednesday is the first of 10 monthly statewide closure days (uniformly the third Wednesday of each month) authorized by the Judicial Council, the constitutionally created body that administers California's court system. As in many other states, the council was created in the 1920s, an outgrowth of the Progressive movement, which sought to make government more efficient, more effective and more accountable. The mission of the council today remains largely unchanged: to ensure the consistent, impartial and accessible administration of justice in the state.

Why then is the council, a body created to protect and increase access to justice in California, allowing our courts to close for even one day a month?

California's economic crisis has affected government at all levels and in nearly every area of service, as well as every aspect of private life and business. For seven months, Californians have endured the effects of mandatory furloughs for many state workers, first two days a month and now three. But courts are not state agencies. And courthouses -- known earlier in our history as "temples of justice" -- are not just office buildings; they are the repository of our fundamental commitment to justice for all. The unintended yet inevitable symbolism of "Closed" signs on institutions that embody our democratic ideals is yet another tragic indicator of the severity of California's economic crisis.

The Judicial Council, with express authorization from the Legislature and the governor, made the difficult decision to close courts one day a month to avoid even more damaging consequences of reductions in the judicial branch's budget. This course of action was taken with great reluctance at an emergency public meeting in July, after substantial input from local courts and after months of examining alternatives. In the end, court closures proved to be the only rational option available to address budget realities while protecting skilled employees from massive layoffs, maintaining a consistent level of court services for litigants and their lawyers, and preserving equal access to justice. Indeed, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County had already concluded that closures were inevitable and in July became the first court in the state to implement monthly closures.

At the emergency meeting, I pledged to reduce my own salary to share in the sacrifice we are asking of the majority of the 21,000 men and women who work in the California judicial branch. I also encouraged my judicial colleagues across the state -- more than 1,600 trial judges and an additional 111 appellate justices -- to join me in voluntarily waiving their salaries for one day a month or donating a portion of their salaries to support court operations. I am gratified to report that a very high percentage of the judges in the state have pledged to either participate in the waiver or to make private donations to their respective courts. As The Times recently reported, that figure is exceptionally high in Los Angeles, where 423 of the 430 judges are participating in voluntary pay reductions.

At this critical juncture in our state's history, even as the judicial branch is forced to close courts one day a month, the state court system itself remains stronger and better able to deliver on the promise of equal justice under law because of the many changes we have made in the last several years. In the years I have served as California's chief justice and chairman of the Judicial Council, the judicial branch has undergone the most significant structural reforms in our state's history.

The court reforms of recent years rival those of the Progressive era and will exceed them in the benefits they provide to the public. Legislation in 1997 that allowed for statewide funding of the trial courts addressed historic inequities in the quality of justice dispensed among California's 58 counties. In 1998, California voters approved an amendment to the state Constitution to permit the unification of the 220 Superior and Municipal courts into 58 trial courts -- one in each county. Unification has allowed greater flexibility in the use of judicial and staff resources, eliminated duplicative services and led to the creation of additional services for the public, such as collaborative justice courts, domestic violence courts, drug courts and complex litigation courts. Finally, the Trial Court Facilities Act of 2002 called for the transfer of responsibility for court facilities from the counties to the state. This allowed the judicial branch for the first time to assume responsibility for the buildings in which judges and court staff work and the public is served, and to do so economically and effectively. To date, 503 (more than 90%) of our court structures have been transferred to the state's ownership under judicial branch management.

These historic changes and the growing responsibilities of the council have been a means to an end. They have strengthened the judiciary as a coequal and independent branch of government and secured the system of checks and balances essential to a robust democracy. They have addressed budget inequities among trial courts around the state. They have improved our branch's accountability to our sister branches of government for the financial appropriations provided to the courts. And ultimately they have enhanced equal access to justice and provided a greater degree of accountability.

One irony of the current crisis is that it restricts court services at a time when the need for them is increasing. The economic downturn has produced a sharp spike in civil filings, especially in the areas of contract and unlawful detainer, which includes evictions. This increase has more than offset a small decline in criminal filings. What this means to judges and court staff is that we are asking them to do more with less. What this means for all Californians is that we must provide adequate resources for courts to resolve disputes in an orderly manner, or suffer the consequences of being unable to meet the public's needs.

When I served as a trial judge in Los Angeles during the 1970s and '80s, California was still in its age of abundance. Today we are in a far more challenging time. The fiscal crisis in our state will have profound effects on many aspects of public service, including the courts, in the next fiscal year and for several years to come. I am committed to protecting the public from the full impact of further reductions in court services, and from any decline in the high quality of justice that so many have worked so long to achieve.

My hope is that as we are tested by this crisis, all of us -- state government officers, justices and judges, court employees and Californians everywhere -- will join together in meeting these challenges. How we proceed will tell us a great deal about the prospects for our state in the years ahead.

Ronald M. George is chief justice of California and chairman of the state Judicial Council.

> Dear Friend,

> As children go back to school this month, a new year of classes has begun. For many children this means advancing to a higher level grade, getting new clothes and new school supplies. Children living in poverty often do not have this luxury and need your help to stay in school. Money is an important factor which provides the means to an education for these children. When a child's family does not have enough money to meet their basic needs, the little money they have is often spent on food and shelter, rather than school. Sometimes, these children must work jobs or consider early matrimony instead of going to school. Older children may drop out of school to work rather than pursuing college. 
> 
> Did you know that only 38% of Afghan children complete primary education?(Atlas of Millenium Development Goals, 2008) In Indonesia, there are nearly three million children in the labor force, many of them in dangerous occupations. (UNICEF, 2008)
>  
> This year, while you are shopping for your own kids for school or college, please consider sponsoring a less fortunate child to help them with the cost of school supplies. Your generosity will enable a child to continue his or her education. Every child deserves an opportunity for a bright future.

> A Field Trip to Summer Camp
> 
> Recently, twenty-five college students in Child Foundation's sponsorship program had the opportunity to take a four day recreational field trip to a summer camp in the Chaloos region of Iran near the Caspian Sea. This trip was made possible by the generosity of Child Foundation sponsors and donors, along with Kamraani Institute, who offered the use of their summer camp for the trip. For some of the participating students, this was the first time they had visited the Caspian Sea.
> 
> After the students arrived at the camp, they enjoyed making potluck dinners at poolside, building a fire and listening to music. At the end of the night, the group surprised one of the students with a decorated graduation cake they had made for her. All the students enjoyed this special trip and took a lot of memorable pictures.

> 9/11 - National Day of Service and Remembrance

Today, September 11, is the National Day of Service and Remembrance and the culmination of the “United We Serve” campaign.  Governor Perdue, First Gentleman Eaves, Cabinet Secretaries, Governor’s Office staff, state government employees and citizens across North Carolina have participated in this campaign to serve others.

> Volunteering always is important, but this especially rings true in these tough economic times when so many need so much help.  

> On Thursday, Gov. Perdue helped launch “Books on Bases, Smiles on Faces,” a literacy program for military children by Blue Star Families and Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S).   She spoke to military children at W.T. Brown Elementary and read “Home is Where the Army Sends You” by local author Melissa Davis.  She also helped distribute more than 4,000 books to local schools with a high population of military children.

> The Governor also announced that N.C. AmeriCorps members and N.C. National Guard armories have united in a service project to honor military families.  The theme was “Little Heroes Family Connection.” AmeriCorps program members gathered across the state to collect items and assemble packages to help children create a message for deployed parents or family members.

> “Through this United We Serve project, North Carolina’s AmeriCorps members and National Guard have shown that it only takes a small effort to give something back to their communities,” Perdue said. “By serving — we honor those who lost their lives on 9/11, and we build strong families and strong communities all over North Carolina.”

> Today, Governor Perdue planted collard greens and cabbages at the Executive Mansion as part of the “Plant a Row for the Hungry” campaign.  Plant a Row (PAR) is a national campaign to encourage all gardeners to grow a little extra produce to donate to the hungry and homeless.  The Raleigh PAR campaign collects produce to donate to the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle.

> Gov. Perdue Vetoes Bill That Would Limit Access to Public Records

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday vetoed House Bill 104, “An Act To Clarify Legislative Confidentiality.”

> “Transparency and accountability are hallmarks of my administration.  If this legislation became law, documents that are currently public record would become private,” said Perdue.  “Additionally, this bill treats certain state employees unequally.”

> The General Assembly passed the legislation on August 10 after making significant changes during the last days of legislative session.

> Pursuant to the Constitution, the Governor must call a special session no later than September 20 unless a majority of each house signs a written document stating that there is no need for the session to be convened.

> Gov. Perdue Calls for Focus on Prevention as Flu Season Arrives

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday called on North Carolina residents to re-dedicate themselves to following good prevention practices as the number of influenza cases are expected to rise with the beginning of the school year and the arrival of flu season.

> “Parents, students and teachers can help prevent the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu from spreading by getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene and keeping themselves healthy,” Perdue said.  “I don’t want folks to be scared about the flu, but I do want every North Carolinian to be vigilant and prepared.”

> Everyone should follow standard health precautions as a first line of prevention;

> - Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
> - If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.
> - Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.
> - Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.
> - Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
> - If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from making them sick.
> - Get the seasonal flu vaccine now and the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.

> For more information about influenza in North Carolina, please visit <http://www.flu.nc.gov>www.flu.nc.gov. 

> Governor Signs Bill to Protect Consumers from Home Foreclosures

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed Senate Bill 974, The Consumer Economic Protection Act Of 2009 (CEPA), which will help homeowners facing foreclosure, preserve communities, and protect consumers from unfair debt collectors.

> “When a home is foreclosed — it’s bad for our families, it’s bad for our communities, it’s bad for our businesses and it’s bad for North Carolina,” said Perdue.  “This bill makes it easier for homeowners to work out a deal with their lenders and avoid foreclosure.”

> Court records show that nearly 40,000 North Carolina homes have gone into foreclosure so far in 2009.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, more than 2.2 million North Carolina homeowners will see their property values decline over the next three years because of foreclosures in their neighborhood.  Foreclosures hurt lenders as well, costing them an estimated 40 percent of the loan value.

> SB 974 empowers the Clerk of Court presiding over a foreclosure hearing to ask what steps have been taken to prevent foreclosure and to continue the hearing for up to 60 days to allow homeowners and lenders more time to negotiate a solution.

> Consumer tips on home loans, debt collectors and many other topics are available from the Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division at <http://www.ncdoj.gov>www.ncdoj.gov.

> Furniture Maker Brings New Plant, 128 Jobs to Alexander County

Caye Home Furnishings, an international manufacturer of custom home furniture, will open a new plant in Taylorsville.  The company plans to invest $1.4 million and create 128 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

> “North Carolina, known worldwide for producing fine furniture, continues to be a leading player in this vital manufacturing sector,” Perdue said.  “Our state’s skilled workforce and superb quality of life continue to attract growing companies like Caye Home Furnishings.”

> Caye Home Furnishings LLC, headquartered in Mississippi, manufactures living room furniture and case goods including products marketed under the Stratford and Stratolounger name brands.  The company has five manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, Florida, two in China and one in Star, N.C., which opened in August 2008 and employs 52 workers.  The new Taylorsville plant will assemble furniture products to serve that growing market.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $30,142, not including benefits, which is higher than Alexander County’s average annual wage of $27,300.

> Gov. Perdue Announces 3,514 Arrests During 15th Anniversary "Booze It & Lose It" Campaign

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that state and local law enforcement officers cited 3,514 motorists for driving while impaired during the Labor Day “Booze It & Lose It” campaign, which ran Aug. 21-Sept 7.  A total of 105,370 traffic and criminal citations were issued statewide.

> “Law enforcement officers statewide are the key reason this initiative has been so successful over the past 15 years and I commend their continued dedication,” Perdue said.  “Their efforts during this campaign allowed for more families to enjoy the end of summer.”

> During the Governor’s Highway Safety Program campaign, officers statewide conducted more than 10,500 sobriety checkpoints and dedicated patrols.  Officers also issued 10,416 safety belt and 1,533 child passenger safety violations, 30,830 speeding violations and 1,819 drug charges. In addition, they apprehended 829 fugitives from justice and recovered 120 stolen vehicles.

> <https://twitter.com/ncgovoffice>> “With only 140 characters, a little bit of twitter can go a long way toward my goal of a transparent, accountable and interactive state gov’t,” tweeted Perdue.

> As part of Gov. Perdue’s emphasis on transparency, accountability and interactivity with the people of North Carolina, she has increased the use of new media.

> TurboCare Announces $30M Expansion in Rural Hall

TurboCare Inc., a subsidiary of Siemens Energy that provides turbomachinery parts and services to companies around the world, will expand its Forsyth County facility, creating 110 jobs and investing $30 million during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $220,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

> “TurboCare’s expansion is a win for Rural Hall and for North Carolina,” Perdue said. “That so many international companies doing business in North Carolina choose to expand here when they have options around the country and around the world shows that our commitments to education, training and a business-friendly environment continue to prove successful.”

> TurboCare offers service solutions in the industrial and power generation markets in more than 100 countries. It provides a complete range of component repair, equipment refurbishment, system retrofits, engineering and parts replacement services with 2,500 workers worldwide. That includes 176 current employees in Rural Hall.

> Salaries for the 110 new workers will vary by job function, but the overall average wage will be $45,855 a year, not including benefits. That is higher than the Forsyth County average annual wage of $39,936 without benefits.

> For more information about TurboCare, including job opportunities, please visit <http://www.turbocare.com>www.turbocare.com.

> Gov. Perdue Announces the Blue Ridge Parkway to be Honored in U.S. Mint Program

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday announced that the Blue Ridge Parkway will be honored in the new U.S. Mint America the Beautiful Quarters program.  Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner approved the list of sites recommended by the U.S. Mint on Aug. 25, 2009, after consultation with Governor Perdue and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar.
>  
> “Countless visitors from around the world have lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway – one of America’s great treasures,” said Perdue. “Now the lasting impressions of the Blue Ridge Parkway and its majestic legacy will be captured on these special coins.”

> The United States Mint’s America the Beautiful Quarters Program is a 12-year initiative authorized by the America’s Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008.  The act directs the United States Mint to strike and issue 56 circulating quarters with tails side designs emblematic of a national park or other national site in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories — Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands.

> The quarters will be issued sequentially each year, in the order in which the featured site was first established as a national park or site.  The coins’ heads side will feature the familiar “restored” 1932 portrait of George Washington, including subtle details and the beauty of the original model.

> To view the complete National Site Registry, which lists all 56 sites to be honored under the U.S. Mint’s America the Beautiful Quarters Program in chronological order by year, please visit <http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/NSQuartersProgram/?action=siteRegister>www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/NSQuartersProgram/?action=siteRegister.
