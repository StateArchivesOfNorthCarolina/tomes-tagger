Dear Governor,††
I as a business owner understand what you are going thru and it is not pretty.†† There† is a way to employee your people almost instantly and save billions on energy waste for the future.† I know this because we do it here everyday.† This is what you need to consider.† Please think about this, you can start a program for energy conservation by producing solar sun screen products for your state.† We will be happy to show you how and help you kick it off.† Solar sun screens are mounted on the exterior of windows of homes and blocks †80% -† 90%† of the suns heat by reflection and absorption thereby reducing 25-50% of the energy cost to cool and heat your homes in your state.† Now the good news is that it will employee tens of thousands of people to measure, make, install this product creating plenty of jobs. You do not need a collage degree to make this product. For example an unemployed school†teacher or banker could do this.† Please if i can help you and your people please give me a call @† Sunscape Shading Products llc.† My name is Bill sanders my phone†# is 928-681-2001††my cell 928-727-7559 †Thanks and i†hope for the best for the future of you and your people.

> State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession,†which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

> In that time, our stateís unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent ó 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolinaís families have been hurt by the recession, so has our stateís budget.

> The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolinaís history.

> Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolinaís government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

> This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our stateís mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

> Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

> Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolinaís long-term economic growth.

> Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

> As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

> We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect†core education, public safety and health care services,†or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

> Public education always†has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolinaís economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

> As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

> Iíve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect†public education.† Now I need your help.† The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.† But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our childrenís education.

> The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.

> †

Mrs. Perdue:
As an American, as an Carolinian, I have had my life taken, I have had my voice taken, I am terrorized 24/7, and yet I am told by this game that you are well aware, you are aware of this town making me their personal prisoner and you do nothing.† You are in violation of the US Constitution by not giving me support, I want my own support team, I want to fight back, I want control of my life. I have begged, pleaded, I have done all to regain control of my life. I want my life back, I want those that did this to me brought to justice, I want to know who did this to me, who made me a prisoner, I want to know who has been poisoning me, who has raped me, who and if they truly put me in prison and who did that to me. I want support in person, in person. not by this game, I am exhausted.† †
I am tried every day at work, I am ridiculed, i am picked apart, for they are trying to sabotage my only means of providing for me and my kids, I am told that Asheville and McDowell Doctors have some type of video† device who sits and watches me at work and they tell the staff and patients what=2 0to say to me, they critique my work, they sit and pick me apart and they terrorize me, I want to know if this is so. I am going to fax you a letter that I sent to the President and I want a meeting with someone and I want to fight for my life. I am tired of being abused, i am tired of hearing that I am criminal, I am tired of hearing that they made me a prisoner and that I am doing time, i can't go out to eat, I cant go to a store without being abused, there were prisoners at a restaurant the other day who made commits to me about being in prison, and I had no idea what they were talking about , they treat me like trash every where I go. I go to the store and they lie about ,e every where I go, they accuse me of stealing and I have never stolen, never, just yesterday I stopped and got gas and this young girl just threw my receipt at me, and I handed hers back to her and I told her that Here I wont throw your back at you. the staff at work treats me like trash, they role play and the other day they told the women of the hospital to stand at the doors, the windows as I walked out and they told me later that they were pretending to be women in prison and that i was going back to prison and yet I have never done anything. I want my own support team now, I am so tired of being treated this way, that society has the audacity to treat anyone this way. i want my own support team, I want my voice heard, i don‚Äôt' want20to go through another day, society is trying to destroy me to cover up their corruption I want to be somewhere safe, my kids safe. They are doing all to destroy me, I can't get a job without whomever this is that is trying to destroy me, I can't get a job or be in control of my life, I was told by this game that some of these Doctors that raped me, sued in my defense and kept the money are going around and showing my picture and they are posting my pictures up with my hair styles and claiming that I am a thief, they are telling people that I am a thief that I steal, that I failed nursing, that I am a fraud that I do drugs. I want to know who they are for I want to prosecute them and put them away, they stole my life, they stole from me pretending to care about me to sue in my honor to only destroy me and keep what should have been mine. I have written a novel, for kids about spiritual warfare and they stole it, I have written a self help book and they stole it, my children‚Äôs books, my songs, my poetry, my submissions to the president, to the pentagon, airlines, my inventions... my surgeries and scientific breakthroughs,.. I want control of my life, they went behind my back and did this to me and I have had no say so, I am treated like trash at work and in public I want my own defense team today, not tomorrow not next week they have done this to me for 13 hellish years and guess what all have partook in it, the offices, the judges=2 0, official electives and I have done nothing at all. I was told that the Mayor if this town has a prison for me and he is part of this and yet I am being threatened and I have done nothing at all, † † † † †
Why does this Nation allow such cruelty, why do you allow them to abuse me, torture me, why do you allow them to do all to destroy me and steal my work, why does my nation allow this? I have to drive back to Virginia today to go to work and to be abused, to be mistreated by employers, by staff, by those that do this to me, to be abused by society and I want this stopped.
They claim that I failed nursing, well I can assure you I did not, I have worked as† nurse for 13 years and during this time I have been abused by them all, I have been drugged, poisoned, raped, sold, made a mockery of and not one time has anyone stood up and given me support, not one time, they sue in my honor only to spend the money they do this every where I work, and they claim that they have the grades, or test, you know as well as I do that the test is not admissible, that they have been fraudulent in every aspect of my life, then you will listen to them over that and you allow them to abuse me while I work and not only that they made me a prisoner all of this ti me an controlled my life and I had no idea, it was all done behind my back and I do not know who they are, that they do this to me, even to this day and I do not know who they are, that they claim that I am a prisoner and yet I have no idea why? I had to learn of my imprisonment by this game of theirs, and talk about devastating me, whom is anointed of God, me who has never done anything but cuss in the privacy of my car after learning of this and that my rapist and those did this to me have jobs, that they are my abusers and no one cares.† That they want me arrested and claim that I failed nursing, after 13 hellish years, well I am have also been told that while I was being watched all of these years as their prisoner, that professors were hired to test me and when I got out of their so called imprisonment they were going to award me my degree or doctrine in Medicine, education, Law‚Ä¶ and now they want to claim that I failed that after all of these years of being abused they want to arrest me and put me in prison again. Not give me what I have done or compensated for what has happened to me or my work, no but to drag me down f or they are abusers, they want and relish in making my life hell, I want my own defense team, I want my voice heard, I want my life back. †Why after 13 years, why, when I provided scientific breakthrough in many areas, why now, why me, and not give me de grees that I have earned and proven myself over and over, they are so consumed in destroying me that they drug me , they put drugs in my good at work, to try to mess me up, they plot to destroy me all the time, the do all to destroy me. Not only that why not all of those that cheat their way through school, which is almost every student, why not those that paid for theirs, why not those that screwed their grade, why not those‚Ä¶ why destroy me instead of me being able to succeed in this Nation? ††
Where is the real Americans, where is the real law? Where are you and why would anyone condone such abuse?

Email: lori.durham@hotmail.com

Subject: Question about gathering info

Comment: Hello, my name is Lori and I live on the Crystal Coast with my finace and his daughter. We love it here and Kevin is a commercial fisherman. He has been in the fishing industry in one capacity or another since he was 12 years old. I guess you know that when it gets in their blood that cannot do anything else. The bad thing is that the fishing industry is slowly disappearing here and it is very sad. To go to the harbor and see the boats just sitting instead of heading out. Not good. Kevin has had an idea for growing and harvesting oysters for sometime and we had wanted to try it but with the economy and a couple of bad years for us as well, we have just not been able to. We truly think it could change the oyster industry at least for the locals here. Since the economy has taken a decline you can ride by the North River in Carteret County at almost anytime and see someone oystering or claming (depending the time of year). My question is - do you know of anywhere I can look for a grant or a program that could help us get started? I have looked everywhere. Thank You so much Lori Durham

Subject: Fighting 4 Stacey

Comment: Dear Madam Govenor, Are you aware that a 27 year old young lady namely Stacey Lynn Nelson is being held hostage by the Wake County Social Services: Adult Child Protective Services due to a false alligation by her cousin Sean Bordonaro accusing her mother of poisoning her down her central line with Windex. Also, according to Sean Bordonaro Stacey's mom was poisoning her grandson Seth with the same substance which Mrs. Nelson does not use.....Blood cultures were never taken nor any tests of the baby's bottle...but everyone took Sean Bordonaro's word even after he was rolling on the ground laughing Ha! Ha! April Fool's!.....$82,000.00 later and still no Stacey home but held hostage now at UNC Hospital for the past month going on two as court date is scheduled for 7/13/09 but may possibly mediate on 7/6/09...Please madam govenor help this great family before they loose their daughter in death.....Presently Stacey is on a temporary central line in the right femoral artery and doctors are desparately trying to get her to sign a document in order to remove the line for good and not replace it but instead force feed through her G-J tubes...both tubes are to straight drains and it is well documented that her motility is very slow and her stomach does not have the absorption/reabsorption most people have consequently her stomach goes in reverse causing her to vomit stool from time to time. Stacey has chronic pacreatitis and RSD (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy) on her right side and requires iv medications as she cannot take by mouth pills due to vomiting....To date Stacey has lost a great deal of weight and is now wearing child size 12....Because the order for TPN was called in late today Stacey will get D-10..Already her coloring is yellowish indicating jaundice...she has coded a few times and we certainly don't want this to happen again....Stacey belongs in her own apartment in her parents home which they moved into last summer...... Stacey's dad is presntly looking into buying burial plots and not sure whether to bury her in NC or Vt.where her grandparents are buried. Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Sincerely, Mary Jo E. Morse morsemaryjo@yahoo.com

Gov. Perdue Calls on General Assembly to Protect Public Education in the State Budget

The state is currently facing a record budget shortfall of $4.7 billion.† Legislators are working hard to close the enormous gap, but there have been brutal cuts proposed to public education.† Cuts proposed so far to education are troubling: increases in class size and elimination of more than 6,000 thousand teachers and thousands more teaching assistants.

Gov. Perdue this week continued to call on the General Assembly to make smart,†tough cuts in the budget and to raise the revenue necessary to protect our classrooms.† She held rallies in Wilmington and Greenville on Monday and released a video message on Tuesday.

Gov. Perdue Launches "United We Serve" Campaign

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that the Governorís Office and the stateís departments and agencies will participate in United We Serve, a national effort launched by President Obama to engage more Americans in serving their communities this summer.

ìThese 11 weeks are a time for North Carolinians to take the lead in organizing service projects and forging partnerships with local organizations to get their communities back on track,î Perdue said. ìWhether you are working in a soup kitchen, reading to a child or helping out a friend in need, everyoneís small efforts can create some big results.î

The campaign kicks off June 22 and runs through September 11, which will be marked for the first time as a national day of service and remembrance.† The initiative focuses on four key areas: education, health, community renewal, and energy and the environment.† It is being led by the Corporation for National and Community Service, a federal agency that improves lives and strengthens communities through volunteering and service.

The governor will focus on mentoring during the summer of service campaign.† Cabinet secretaries will volunteer with different nonprofits and advocacy groups throughout the summer as well.† The governor also encourages state employees to use their allotted 24 community service hours in support of the initiative and to help get North Carolina back on track.

The Obama administration created <http://www.serve.gov/>www.serve.gov, a Web site that allows visitors to find local volunteer opportunities†by typing in their zip code and†allows organizations to recruit volunteers by posting their projects.

Federal Energy Department OKs NC Plan to Use Recovery Fund to Create Green Jobs, Save Energy

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that the U.S. Energy Department has approved North Carolinaís $75.9 million Energy Plan to improve energy efficiency, promote greater use of renewable energy resources and create more green jobs.† The program will be funded through the stateís share of federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act†(ARRA) funds.

<https://mail.msa-corp.com/exchange/mfowler/Drafts/RE:%20%5BOffice%20of%20Governor%20Bev%20Perdue%5D%20Governor%20Continues%20Her%20Fight%20toProtect%20Public%20Education.EML/1_multipart/Newsletter%20Logo.jpg>ìWith this approval, North Carolina is prepared to quickly move ahead to create jobs and position our state to become a national leader in green energy,î said Gov. Perdue.† ìI have directed the State Energy Office and other agencies to move as fast as possible to put these funds to work creating jobs and building North Carolinaís green economy.î

Through†ARRA funding to the State Energy Program, North Carolina is significantly increasing its investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy, building its sustainable energy economy and workforce and promoting innovation and development of new energy technologies and resources.

The federal Energy Department has given the state the go-ahead to start the program and spend $30.4 million.† The state will receive the remaining funds as it shows it has successfully implemented the plan.

North Carolina is focusing on six areas for federal Recovery Act State Energy Program:

- Supporting small businesses and industry through energy savings,†
- Growing North Carolinaís green workforce through JobsNow,†
- Developing an Energy Investment Revolving Loan Fund,†
- Improving government energy efficiency,†
- Promoting residential energy efficiency and renewable energy, and†
- Fostering renewable energy technology and resource innovation.

ìWe will increase our energy efficiency, use new and emerging technologies; and develop creative partnerships with the private and nonprofit sectors,î Gov. Perdue said.

Take Your Dog To Work Day

Today, June 26, is "Take Your Dog To Work Day."† The day was created to†celebrate the great companions dogs make and to encourage pet adoptions.† Gov. Perdue was happy to participate.

31 Highway Contracts Awarded, Including 11 Recovery Projects

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that 31 contracts totaling $73 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including 11 projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

The 20 other projects awarded are located in Anson, Buncombe, Cabarrus, Catawba, Cumberland, Granville, Henderson, Iredell, Lincoln, Madison, Mecklenburg, Mitchell, New Hanover, Polk, Sampson, Stanly, Transylvania, Warren and Yancey counties.

<https://mail.msa-corp.com/exchange/mfowler/Drafts/RE:%20%5BOffice%20of%20Governor%20Bev%20Perdue%5D%20Governor%20Continues%20Her%20Fight%20toProtect%20Public%20Education.EML/1_multipart/Newsletter%20Logo.jpg>ìNorth Carolinaís manufacturing sector remains strong and diverse,î Gov. Perdue said.† ìOur state is attractive to growing companies because of our highly skilled workforce, business-friendly climate and tremendous quality of life.î

Subject: Inhumane treatment of prison inmates

Comment: On behalf of my family and friends, we are concerned that inmates that come to Chapel Hill Hospital are treated inhumanely. We do not believe that it is necessary to handcuff their hands, feet and waists. We are aware that security measures must be taken, but we believe and contend that it should be in a more dignified manner. These are still human beings who have been diagnosed with a terrible illness. Thank you.

Subject: Mr Leonard R. Sanders

Comment: My father worked for the Fayetteville City Parks & Recreation Dept. For over 50 years, as Cape Fear Court Recreation Center Director. His family home, at 212 Short St., Fayetteville N.C., will be purchased in the HOPE VI Redevelopment Project. We have just learned that a city park is planned for the very site of his home. Mr. Sanders played a very important role in not only the Wilmington Road area's history, but Fayetteville's history as well. His contributions aren't easily measured. They benefits of his tireless work were only realized over the passage of many decades of community and political service. It is very difficult to measure the role he played in influencing the path of countless youth that came under his influence. Although the Wilmington Road Area is mainly remembered for its poverty and crime, there were many who survived their experience there and flourished. Some who he touched through the baseball, softball, punt pass and kick, drill teams, bicycle contest, square dances, the kindergarten, adult social functions, movies that we watched outside on a grassy hill and countless other events that if the only accomplishment was to divert a young mind from a negative to a positive speeches volume when multiplied by thousands of individuals over many many years. What of the doctors, lawyers, military officers and those who made it to the ranks of outstanding major college athletes and some to the NFL and NBA. My father is survived by 3 sons and a daughter, plus thousands of others that still reflect on the contribution that he made to that part of the city. We all were happy to find that a park, of all things is planned for the site of our family home. In his memory, we think that a historical commemorative sign should be placed at the site of his home. We would appreciate any assistance that you and your office can provide.

He has been in a very intense rehab for months and is very focused on changing his life and is showing great improvement.He has been in many rehabs over the years,but this one seems to be the best one. Now he is faced with not being able to find work because he is a felon. Is there anything available for someone who truly wants to work but the past seems to stop him? We would all appreciate any help in directing him. I do know there are programs in other states who are starting programs just for these reasons.

Subject: Divorce/Separation - abandonment

Comment: On February 11th my husband abandoned the home and said he was filing for divorce. He stated he was jerking all the money from the bank and would leave me penniless so I had no recourse but to pursue post separation support. After 2 grueling days in court, I received half the support needed and was shocked that I had to pay my attorney's fees, on top of the stress and already suffered from the shock of abandonment. What recourse do I have on this. Men are abandoning and screwing the women of NC royally and the justice system is not backing us up making them take financial repercussions for their actions. I cannot afford these attorney's fees. It is a discrace against women's rights and an injustice that a woman is court ordered to pay for a man to abandon her as the post separation support is a no fault process and is adultery could not be mentioned at this time. There should be a law passed that abandonment automatically constitues the other party to assume a repercussions and attorney's fees.

Comment: Mrs Perdue, My name is Malissa Warters I am writing because on April 9,2008 my husband was sentenced to 6-8 years in prison for armed robbery. I understand that he has to pay for his crime but the economy at the time and his line of work were totally against our family. Now James my husband has sat in prison while I have had to bounce from house to house because I am uneducated beyond High School and I have two toddlers with me. I have heard the regret and pain in his voice for doing such a ridiculous thing. I have never heard my husband be so mature as he is now. I am BEGGING you to please look over his file and PLEASE consider a pardon. It's really hard out here without two parents. He should have thought about what he was losing when he did the crime. But, he did not. I truly believe with every ounce of knowledge that I have that this man has changed and is sorry and just wants to work hard and be his family. Please write back Mrs Berdue. Sincerely, Malissa J. Warters

Subject: My husband‚Äôs release

Comment: Ms. Perdue; My name is Jeannine Lorenz. I need your help. My husband has been sentenced under the structured sentencing program for 6 years 9 months for embezzlement. He has served 2 years presently. In that time my 2 small girls and I have had to file for bankruptcy, loose our healthcare and go on food stamps. I am a freelance graphic designer who has up until now been able to maintain our way of life. Then the depression hits and wipes out most of my clients and the very little that I had in an IRA. All that is gone now and, I am almost 3 months behind in my mortgage and all the other bills are going to become late as well. We are good people. My husband admitted his mistake, turned himself in and was told that he would just have to pay restitution. This was all misinformation and a huge lack of caring on the part of his DA. We could not afford our own lawyer at the time and so he took council from the state, and here we are. Ms. Perdue, I beg you to let him out and commute his sentence. He would be able to find a job, we have friends that have offered to help him out. I can‚Äôt go through much more. I am really at the end of my rope. We just need someone to realize that if he doesn‚Äôt get out before the end of his sentence that we won‚Äôt be here. I can‚Äôt keep up the pace. I have no more sources to go to for help. Please help my 9 year old and 6 year old get their father back. I beg of you please. His NCDOC # is 1028213 Thank you Jeannine Lorenz 336-687-2937

Subject: Property Management

Comment: Hello We're having trouble getting our rent deposit back from Concord Management, Greensboro, NC. 336-273-0598. The contact is Lance. Our son and four other UNCG college students rented a house last year at 4 Adcock St, Greensboro. They terminated the lease at the end of April. We cleaned the house and received the all-clear, no problems from Lance. Our son and two others moved out. One decided to stay and other students are said to be moving/moved in. Lance told Karen, my wife, and Vicky, Ryan's mother, and the boys that he would send the deposit w/in 30 days, per law. We have not yet received the monies. Yesterday I called him and got the run around. He told us to get the monies from the people moving in. He also expressed that he didn't want to give us the refund because he was worried that the new renters would not pay and he would have to evict them. Neither of these are my problems. He should refund our deposit. Lance's behavior and comments promote a shady operation. He needs to be investigated and audited for co-miggling of funds and miss-management of escrow account. If he knows the law, as he states, then he should have refunded the deposit long ago. If you could call him to facilitate our refund, that would be great.

Subject: Please Help Save My Business

Comment: Governor Bev Purdue: I am writing to plead for your help with regard to the budget's "click-through" sales tax in SB 202 Section 27C.2. My small business (http://teenormous.com) makes over 90% of its revenue by referring t-shirt shoppers to online retailers. All of this revenue is at risk if this bill passes. I agree that NC should collect the sales tax it deserves, but this approach is putting many small local businesses including my own at risk of going out of business overnight. Many companies have already closed their affiliate programs and many more will follow resulting in no additional sales tax revenue. Many small businesses will fail resulting in less NC income tax revenue. The end result is many companies will continue to avoid this tax while an entire industry could vanish in North Carolina. Please help to remove these sections from the budget bill and pursue a sales tax collection that is fair and does not unfairly penalize small businesses in North Carolina. Sincerely, -- Tom Davies Cary, NC 27513-3822

I have received a few emails about the shortfalls. I do not know why I
have always heard from some of the people from the state North Carolina I
was born in, but maybe just because I know people from there.

I am currently offering a book for sale that could be an opportunity for
earning money and is also an elementary primer as educationally basic as
an Aesop fable from the Americas could be. My newly published short story
is an artistically tasteful peaceful story of endorsement of good
legendary family trees that should be the same the world over.

Please let me know if there is a more appropriate office to contact or if
you need more information.

Sincerely,
Sara Morris Swetcharnik

ADDRESSES (as some of the old email addresses we have no longer function):

Artist and Author: Sara Morris Swetcharnik is available for scheduling
readings including reading from her newly published
"My Patriotic Primer, Lesson I: Patriotic Permissions".
This well written narrative short story about her childhood reading of the
historic legend of George Washington, the cherry tree and the elementary
patriotism that it engendered is an ideal wholesome event book. It only
takes three minutes to read and usually makes even persons with no sense
of humor smile.

This short story formatted like an old school primer is available for sale
for $30 (or $20 each for ten or more).

The Swetcharnik Art Studio (also near Mt. Airy, MD) welcomes scheduling

Email: brewington.l.reid@us.army.mil

Subject: Active Duty Service Member In Need Of Assistance. I have exhausted all resources. Please Help

Comment: To whom it may concern, My name is PFC Brewington Lyle Reid Jr. I am an active duty service member with the United States Army. I enlisted in November 2007 with the North Carolina Army National Guard under the Active First Program. I am now stationed at Fort Huachuca in Arizona. I am under the 11th Signal Brigade and I am in Charlie Company 86th Signal Battalion. I am writing because I have been experiencing a lot of issues in regards to my contract, finances and working thru my chain of command in regards to volunteering for an early deployment to assist in helping with my financial hardship. Contract My issues with my contract have not been resolved and I have not been getting any answers in regards to my issues. I have brought my issues to my chain of command, retention, finance and I have also made contact with an outside Army Career Counselor. All of these efforts have still brought no resolution and I have hit a complete brick wall. Contract Issue # 1 (GI Bill and Student Loan Repayment Program): Under my initial enlistment in 2007 with NC Army National Guard with the Active First Program Option I was offered the GI Bill and the Student Loan Repayment. However, when I took my option to go to leave the National Guard and go to the Regular Army which was a stipulation of my enlistment, but the issue is I have not been awarded neither and both are in my contract as to what I am to receive for my enlistment. I was also told that I cannot get both even though both are in my contract. I told them if I had to choose between the two programs I will take the Student Loan Repayment Program because that is very important to me so my credit is not affected. I am also currently enrolled in college course so I am able to obtain my degree while enlisted, but my Student Loans are very important and I need those taken care of because due to my financial hardship I cannot afford the loan payments. However, I still have not been afforded my Student Loan Repayment Program or any answers to when it will start or why I haven‚Äôt received it. Contract Issue # 2 (Enlistment Bonus) The terms of payment for my enlistment bonus are not being honored. Under the Active First Program I signed for a $40,000.00 bonus. My contract states that $10,000.00 of the bonus is to be paid when I first arrived to my duty station and I am to receive installments of $10,000 on the anniversary of my enlistment date. I signed my active duty contract 22 July 2008, and that would make my year anniversary date 22 July 2009. I have received my first installment, but I am having an issue with the payment of my second installment which is due 22 July 2009. Due to my financial hardship I contacted Finance to ensure I would be receiving my bonus on time, but I was told that I will not be receiving my second installment 22 July 2010. That doesn‚Äôt follow the terms of my contract and is simply a breech of contract. I want my contractual obligations honored because that is what I enlisted for and I have been fulfilling all of my obligations to the United States Army. Volunteer for early deployment (WAIS Tasking) Due to my financial hardship I have been seeking financial relief, so I have expressed an interest in volunteering for a WAIS Tasking which will afford me the opportunity for an early deployment to either Iraq or Afghanistan. I have even offered to relinquish my dwell for after the WAIS Tasking and deploy with 86th Signal Battalion on their scheduled deployment. I was informed by a Non Commissioned Officer that handles the WAIS Tasking that a request for a tasking slot for me can be sent up for me to deploy early, but it can‚Äôt be done unless my battalion approves me to go. I brought the issue up to my chain of command and my request for approval was denied with total disregard to my financial hardship. I was told that I will not be granted approval due to ESB classes that I was scheduled to attend. However, on the start date of my ESB classes I was told that I was dropped from the ESB classes and would not be attending. So since I was removed from the ESB classes I brought up the fact again that I wanted to volunteer for a WAIS Tasking to Iraq or Afghanistan because I am in a financial hardship. This time my requests have been ignored. The NCO that does the WAIS Tasking has informed me again that they are more than willing to get me a tasking, but are unable to move forward without my battalion‚Äôs approval. This task can be accomplished but my chain of command is refusing to even acknowledge my hardship and my dedication to the United States Army. I have exhausted all of my resources on getting all of these issues resolved. You as my Senator are my last resort to resolving these issues, and I am reaching out to you as a soldier in need. All I am asking is that my contract be honored in regards to my Student Loan Repayment Program, my bonus schedule be honored as written in my contract and I get assistance in gaining a WAIS Tasking slot so that I may deploy early and better my financial situation. I have gone thru my chain of command with these issues and haven‚Äôt seen any resolution, so I am asking for your help. Please. Thank you in advance, PFC Brewington Lyle Reid Jr. C Co. 86th Signal Battalion Fort Huachuca, AZ (520) 533-8246

Subject: citiMortgage

Comment: Govenor Perdue you are my last hope of finding justice. You see I bought my home in 2003 and have been blessed with work so I have been able to make all my payments on time. But in December of 2008 Citimortgage informed me that I had not paid them in the month of July 2008. I informed them that I always make my payments vis western Union and I have my receipts to show that I did ndeed pay that month and have never missed a month. They asked me to send them copies of the receipts which I did, first by mail then by fax. They continued to send me mail threatening foreclosure. I then contacted Western Union and they sent me their record of the transaction which also shows that the money was accepted by their account No. So I sent this evidence to the collection department of Citi with a cover letter asking them to please correct the mistake and reinstate my good credit. They responded with a letter saying that if I did not pay the month they say is in default together with this month's payment plus all the late fees by July 3 they will take accion against me. Govenor Perdue, I cannot afford a lawyer and I have been trying in vain to contact legal Aide for the past three weeks but they just do not answer the phone. they put me on hold for about half an hour then they say to call back later. I did contact the CCCS of Forsyth Co. and they faxed a referral for me to legal aide, but today is the second of July and still I have not heard from legal aide. So I am asking you to please help my family not to lose our home through this affair. Thank you for your attention Antony Gonzalez. 336-794-7623 (home, evenings) 336-830-5264 (cel.) tonysp58@aol.com

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession,†which many of you have already experienced first-hand.
In that time, our stateís unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent ó 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolinaís families have been hurt by the recession, so has our stateís budget.
The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolinaís history.
Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolinaís government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.
This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our stateís mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.
Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.
Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolinaís long-term economic growth.
Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.
As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.
We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect†core education, public safety and health care services,†or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.
Public education always†has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolinaís economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.
As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.
Iíve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect†public education.† Now I need your help.† The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.† But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our childrenís education.
The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.

††††††††††Sincerely,

Subject: Dell Financial Services

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: It is with great regret that I must write this letter. Back in December of 2008, I ordered some ink cartridges from Dell - spoke with customer rep about what I needed (had previously purchased my cartridges online - should have kept to that script). Well, Dell kept sending the wrong cartridges and I kept sending them back (have all my emails including Dell's receipt of returned product(s)). The situation has escalated. They are now billing me close to $300 (including interest and late payments) for merchandise I have yet to receive, and no longer want. They also messed up my credit with all three credit agencies which did not allow me to re-finance my home in June of 2009. I have tried calling (staying on the phone for up to 2-4 hours) only to be put on hold, transferred from department to department, and finally disconnected on their end. I have sent numerous emails and nothing seems to work. I cannot seem to get this issue resolved. Please, will you help me? Sincerely Lisa N Cockerham 336.737.9038

Comment: To whom it may concern, please consider this request!!! My name is Lynae Thomas. I have been a small business owner here in Raleigh for the past 9 years - www.lynae.com. My boyfriend, Christopher Smith works Military Intelligence for the Air Force since 2000. He is stationed in NAHA, Japan. As you know, with the world as it is, life is more than difficult for him at this point. Stress levels are very high!! His goal after he retires from the Air Force ultimately is to become the House Speaker. He is truly a great man. His 27th birthday is 7/19/09. With the economy there is no way I can visit him for his birthday so I am praying for the next best birthday gift. The opportunity to meet Governor Perdue & have a picture taken with her. Also A signed birthday card from her and I. This would make his birthday complete & lift his spirits tremendously!! I honestly can't express enough how much this would mean to both Christopher and I. He is off to Hawaii 7/15/09 for another exercise. If this is a possibility I would love to send the picture and birthday card to him before he's off to Hawaii. Thank you for taking time to read this and hopefully consider it!! Sincerely, Lynae Thomas Style by Lynae (919) 601-4058 lynaethomas@hotmail.com

Subject: Child support

Comment: Good afternoon, I will try to be brief but my story is long. I currently have an open child support case within your state which has been active since 1995. The current arrears are $63,600.00. My ex husband fled to your state from my home state of New Jersey in December of 1995 to avoid paying this support. For 9 years he was successful. In March of 2004 he was located and ordered to pay a small amount and sent home. He has done this since that time.....pays a small amount to satisfy a court hearing, walks out and stops paying. Your courts will let 6 months or more go by before a court date is set and then state that he was not properly served. My oldest child has been emancipated since he joined the Navy in 2006. My second son is a full time student in college and still very much my dependent. My ex husband has not spoken to my boys since 1995 by his own choice. He left without saying good bye and has never looked back. He has been successful in becoming a dead beat dad and I feel that your courts have allowed him to continue this horrific choice he made. I have read your child support guidelines and it states that you do everything you can to enforce child support. He has his own business which he chooses to keep off the books and therefore (I am told) you can not adhere a wage garnishment. He is remarried and apparently keeps everything he owns in his wife's name. The advertise on line that they own a house a boat etc. I have tried to contact your courts several times only to be told that I must only contact my case worker in the state of NJ and that this is the only contact I may have. Why is this the case??? Isn't this case about me and my children? Why is my ex husband not in jail, without a license, no leans on his property etc, your web site states these are all the actions you take for unpaid child support. He meets each and every criteria for a federal crime as it is spelled out in the 1992 child support recovery act. Why is he allowed to get away with this? I have placed myself in great debt over the years supporting my sons to ensure they have everything they need. I have never asked for anything that wasn't court ordered. I would gladly have this case looked at so that the original amount ordered (when my boys were only 8 and 5) could be re evaluated to be more appropriate to the times. My ex husband hired a lawyer in 2006 when he learned (via my sons facebook account) that my oldest was in the Navy. He was demanding that my son be emancipated (which if he had maintained any sort of contact, he would have known had been done by me). He had money to waste on a lawyer when he felt he was being taken advantage of, but has never supported my sons in the first place. This is ridiculous to me. I am also writing to your legislature and congress in the hopes that someone, somewhere will hear my story and help. I thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

Subject: A plea for help for my children

Comment: In 2002 I had the best moment a man can have at any age. I had a son and his name is Robert Michael Murray Jr. In 2004 I had another best moment a man can have at any age. I had a daughter and her name is Caitlyn Brialle Murray. Over the past 8 years I had a horrible struggle and been witnessed to some horrific behavior. This behavior involved physical, mental, emotional and spiritual abuse with the interactions of drug and alcohol to magnify an already disgusting number of events. They say you never know a family until you are a family member. You see in 2002 I also married into the Gagliardo family and without knowing that for the next 8 years and more I would be witness to this horrific behavior and worse. The worse is my children have been exposed to it. Now to say I am perfect and handled every event correctly would be a lie. But to say I have loved my children from the moment they entered this world and sacrificed a lot to take care of them and provide for them and yes to protect them would be an understatement. But it does not end there. My son pulled cocaine bags at the age of 1 out of a couch that came from the Gagliardo household. I wanted to call the police but instead called my wife. She showed up an hour later with her father and brother to remove the couch and swear everyone to secrecy so their mother would not find out. No one was worried about my son. This continued on until August 2006 when drug dealers came to the Gagliardo household looking for the brother merely an hour after my children had been there. The Gagliardos took their son and ran from NY to Las Vegas NV without a concern for my family. So a couple days after the drug dealers were harassing everyone at the Gagliardo family run business I packed my wife and children and sent them to my parent in Charlotte NC. But did it end there? No it did not. There is so much to this story and I am not the best person to tell it. You see since 2003, Dr. Lori Arella, a NY State certified Family psychologist saw us for over 5 years in hopes of escaping a toxic and violent family dynamic of the Gagliardos. In high hopes that my children would stop being exposed to drugs. In high hopes they would stop being exposed to being dragged through parking lots due to violent arguments between their mother and their grandparents. In high hopes my daughter would be able to put on a winter jacket without breaking down in tears because Grandma says she is fat. In high hopes of so much more... In 2007 I file for legal separation in high hopes of being able to get a job and eventually get my children full time to prevent them from following in their mother's and uncles footsteps who started taking drugs at the early age of 9 and 11. But I lost my job... and with it I lost my children who were taken against a court document from Charlotte NC to LAs Vegas, Nevada. The only thing I knew was someone stopped answering the telephone when I called. Then the telephone was disconnected. Then I received a telephone call from my son's school looking for him. Then I got the email... The email stated here is our new home address and it was (wrong) but it was supposed to be the Gagliardo household in Las Vegas NV. The same house the family fled to in 2006 to escape the drug dealers. The same place where drugs were purchased, used and sold since 2006 by the brother using both personal funds stolen from the parents and company funds stolen and hidden from the parents company. Am I frustrated? Yes... The law has been broken. My children are in danger. and I have no job and I cannot get legal assistance to prevent an act to alienate me from my children. I welcome anyone to challenge me and drill me to get to the truth. I welcome the IRS to review my taxes. I welcome the DOL to review my employment status and income. I welcome the ACS/CPS to review me. The truth be told when you are done reviewing me I give my absolute permission and blessing for you to speak to our state certified marriage/family therapist to learn the truth. Because I have nothing to hide and I want to help my children. I want my children safe... There is so much more to this story and please do not let it end with more death, violence and abuse... A loving father... Robert M. Murray Sr....

Increased Opportunity for Historically Underutilized Businesses

The Office for Historically Underutilized Businesses (HUB)†launched its new Statewide Uniform Certification (SWUC) program on Wednesday.† SWUC was developed to streamline the certification process, reduce the redundancy in certifying minority and women-owned businesses and create a centralized HUB and minority/women business database.† The HUB Office will take the lead in certifying HUB and Minority/Women Business Enterprise (M/WBE) firms that previously had to apply for certification both through the state HUB Office and local M/WBE program offices.

ìThis initiative will expand opportunities for minority-, disabled- and women-owned businesses to participate in state and local government contracts,î said Gov. Bev Perdue, who recently issued Executive Order No. 13 to assist HUB firms. ìWe trust it will help the state achieve, and hopefully exceed, its aspirational goal of at least 10 percent of all state government contracts being awarded to HUB firms.î

SWUC is the result of N.C. General Statute 143-128.4, 143-48.4.† It was developed by the HUB Office in collaboration with local M/WBE program directors and with feedback from HUB firms, prime contractors and HUB resource advocates.† In addition to increasing efficiency and service to the HUB community, SWUC will establish a centralized database for state agencies, local municipalities and contractors looking to identify and utilize HUB vendors and sub-contractors.

Buncombe County Manufacturer to Add 32 Jobs

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that Baldor Electric Co., an international supplier of industrial electric motors, mechanical power transmission products, drives and generators, will expand its Weaverville operations.† The company plans to invest more than $4.8 million and create 32 jobs during the next three years.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $64,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

ìNorth Carolina remains attractive to thriving companies like this one,î Gov. Perdue said.† ìOur top-ranked business climate and knowledge-based workforce help keep our manufacturing sector strong and diverse, providing the good jobs our citizens have come to expect.î

Baldor Electric Co., headquartered in Arkansas, operates 26 manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Canada, England, Mexico and China, and provides products to more than 70 countries. Three of the companyís plants are in North Carolina, employing a combined workforce of nearly 700 people.

Baldor is consolidating its Sleevoil hydrodynamic bearing line in Indiana and moving those operations to its Weaverville plant, which currently employs 128 workers.† The 32 new jobs added over the next three years will pay an average wage of $42,209, not including benefits, which is higher than the Buncombe County average of $32,968.

This project follows two other recent One NC Fund announcements for Baldor facilities in Western North Carolina.† In June, Gov. Perdue announced 114 new jobs and an investment of $12.2 million in Cleveland County.† In May, the governor announced 25 new jobs and an investment of $3.1 million in McDowell County.

"Booze It & Lose It: Operation Firecracker"

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that state and local law enforcement officers will be out in full force over the Fourth of July holiday as part of the ìBooze It & Lose It: Operation Firecrackerî campaign. Checkpoints and stepped-up patrols will be conducted Monday, June 29, through Sunday, July 5, across the state in an effort to remove impaired drivers from the roads.

ìToo many people fail to understand that alcohol and driving donít mix. Impaired driving is no accident, nor is it a victimless crime,î Perdue said. ìLaw enforcement officers will crack down on impaired drivers, ensuring that everyone is celebrating the holiday responsibly.î

There were 377 alcohol-related crashes, 322 with injuries and 12 that resulted in fatalities, over the Independence Day week last year.

Officers charged more than 1,900 North Carolina motorists with driving while impaired during the 2008 ìBooze It & Lose It: Operation Firecrackerî campaign. More than 5,700 stepped-up patrols and checkpoints were held.

Subject: Restored rights of felons

Comment: I was convicted of a felony in 1987 in Yadkin county. I had my citezenship rights restored in 1989. Everything was restored except the right to own firearms. I have been a model citizen, I haven't even had a ticket in N.C. in 20 years. Is there anyway I can get my rights restored totally? I own my on house, I vote, and pay my taxes on 6 vehicles. I have been a law biding citizen all my life except for one mistake. Thank you for your time.

Governor Perdue,

Please look into the horrible things that are occurring at Stokes County Animal Shelter. The shelter is euthanizing animals in the most inhumane way. I fear that most of the public doesn't know what is occurring behind closed doors at this shelter. Stokes Animal Shelter is using a dump truck gas chamber to kill the animals. This is not right. Please take action. I do not appreciate my tax paying dollars going to use here. Our civilization has evolved. Stokes should have to evolve as well and not act in such barbaric ways. Myself, and other tax payers would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

Allison Wilkins
