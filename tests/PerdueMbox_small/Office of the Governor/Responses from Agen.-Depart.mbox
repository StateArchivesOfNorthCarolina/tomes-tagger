Thank you Ms. Lovelace. ¬†I also received an email address for Information Specialist and I understand per the North Carolina Industrial Commission that the Defense Counsel must be advised. ¬†Accordingly I ask Information Specialists here to please ¬†advise what should happen when a first report of injury (Form 19) is filed and how I can get a copy of the form 19 on the subject.
Sincerely,

According to your email, you received from us a copy of the information submitted electronically to the Industrial Commission‚Äîthe ‚ÄúIMAGING SYSTEM FORM 19 FOR ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED FORM 19s.‚Äù ¬†The electronic First Report of Injury (Form 19) is a series of numerical codes that is transmitted by a computer to the Industrial Commission database. ¬†After the electronic transmission is complete, the numerical codes are converted into text and the imaging system form is generated by our database and electronically placed into your file.¬† This is the only first report of injury information in your file.¬†¬†
¬†
The North Carolina Industrial Commission has information specialists who are trained to give unrepresented employees, employers and carriers basic information about the¬†North Carolina¬†workers‚Äô compensation system.¬† From your emails, it appears that you are concerned that you have not received everything you should have received from defendants.¬† You may call our information specialists at 1-800-688-8349.¬† They can give you further information about what should happen when a first report of injury (Form 19) is filed and may be able to answer some of your other concerns.

Dear Ms. Lovelace:
¬†
I understand that the Form 19 in my case was electronically filed. ¬†Why have I not received a copy of the Form 19 submission? ¬†My understanding is that I should receive a copy based on the following taken directly from¬†the North Carolina Industrial Commission (NCIC) website:
¬†
IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR EMPLOYER
Employer must furnish a copy of this form, as completed, to the employee or the employee‚Äôs representative when submitted
to the Insurance Carrier or Claims Administrator for transmission to the Commission. Every question must be answered. This
Form 19 must be transmitted to the Commission through your insurance carrier/claims administrator, and is required by law
to be filed within 5 days after knowledge of accident. Employer must also give employee a blank Form 18.
¬†
¬†
Is my understanding correct? ¬†And if so, when will I receive the copy. ¬†I have not heard anything from the defense counsel on the subject.

Good morning, Ms. Weedon.



Deputy Commissioner Brad Houser has been assigned to hear your case in February 2009, and your case is now under his jurisdiction.† You may want to consider copying Deputy Commissioner Houser and his Legal Assistant, Debra Bell on your correspondence going forward rather than Deputy Commissioner Philip Baddour and his Legal Assistant, Sue Baird.† Deputy Commissioner Baddour is no longer involved in your case.†



In addition, I have forwarded Deputy Commissioner Houser a hard copy of your emails that I have been party to.



I hope this information is helpful.† If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Crime and the Courts


Message:


I have e-mailed two other letters, but have composed a letter with more information and it follows. Thank you taking the time to read this and I appreciate anything you can do to help me and my son.

I am asking for help to correct a very wrong situation that has occurred and I am hoping that you could help me and my son. Please let me introduce myself. My name is Katherine Flynn. My son is Andrew Scott Kislek. The state of North Carolina has incorrectly issued a warrant for his arrest in North Carolina. I am not sure of the exact charge; my son says it was a felony charge to do with trafficking a license. Please let me explain what has happened. My son is innocent of these charges and we need someone in a position of authority to help us get the charges dropped!

I lived in North Carolina for 5 years. During this time I was married to Timothy Wesley Conway. Mr. Conway is now my ex-husband. When we were first married Mr. Conway was an employee of the North Carolina DMV. One day he brought home a motorcycle learnerís permit that had belonged to Terry LaBonte the race car driver. He had given Mr. LaBonte his regular motorcycle license and kept the learnerís permit. He put the license away and I thought no more about it. Mr. Conway was fired from the DMV in North Carolina while we were together. I am not sure of the reason, but I think it had to do with him speaking badly about superiors to customers. We then moved to Tucson, Arizona. We separated and after about 9 months Mr. Conway gave me back some of my possessions which included a chest of drawers where I found the Terry LaBonte license. The license stayed in the drawer a long time. A gentleman at work was talking about NASCAR one day and I mentioned the license. He sa id perhaps a collector of sports memorabilia might like to have it. I was working full-time as a secretary at the University of Arizona and supporting my son and myself as he worked hard to get through college. I thought about what my friend said about a collector wanting the license as it would be similar to having an autographed item that Mr. LaBonte had signed. I looked online and saw that Babe Ruthís family had sold his driverís license. There was another sports star that it mentioned had done similar but I cannot recall the name at the time. I also looked online to make sure that Mr. LaBontesí address was not the same; it appeared that he had moved to Winston-Salem. I did not want someone to have his actual physical address. There was NO social security number on the license. The license was long since expired. With all of the aforementioned information, I decided to post an ad on E-Bay. I composed the ad, which stated clearly that it was a one of kind piece of memorabilia. I was in no way trying to steal anyoneís identity! I scanned the photo of the license. The problem was that I had no E-Bay account, nor the knowledge of how to use it. My son, Andrew Kislek, happened to have an account as he had used E-Bay to sell his collection of ìMagic the Gatheringî cards and had purchased items on E-Bay. He stood by and showed me how to post the ad. I put the actual ad on E-Bay. I only asked him to check the e-mail as it was his account. There was some contact regarding the ad, but NO SALE.

The ad was only online a couple of weeks as best I can recall. The state of North Carolina contacted my son. He told them the situation; that we got the license in a piece of furniture that my ex-husband gave back to me. The investigator asked to have the license returned. I returned the license by mailing it to the address he gave to my son. Let me reiterate that my son never had any kind of possession of this license. I scanned the license for the ad and e-mailed him the copy so he could show me how to put it on the ad. I wrote the ad for E-Bay and, again, he showed me how to put it on there. My sonís only involvement was to allow me to use his account. This was explained to the investigator. I called the number my son gave me and left him a message stating the fact that I was responsible for the ad, the content and placing that ad. We have not heard from the investigator for a very long time. My son found out quite by accident that there was a warrant for his arr est in North Carolina. This is a grave mistake on the part of the state of North Carolina. He is innocent of these charges. If they should charge anyone, it should be me!!!! Could you please contact the DMV and the investigator tohelp get these charges dropped against my son. This will save the state a lot of money in prosecuting an innocent person!! We need help as I cannot afford an attorney. It seems fruitless and just plain wrong to bring charges against someone who is innocent and the person who should be charged has told the investigator that they are responsible. The investigator, I believe, is Dail Eason. He can be reached at 1-910-486-1331. You will need to ask for him personally. I have tried to contact him but was told he was out of the office until Monday. I am sure the state of North Carolina would not want to be responsible for charging an innocent person and I would hope Mr. Eason would be kind enough to drop the charges against my son immediately. I am re sponsible for what has happened and have reiterated that fact. Please help me. I am a respectable person that has had no problems with the law. However, I cannot afford an attorney to fight the charges for my son. It hurts me deeply that I donít have the money to do that! My salary is just about $20,000 a year after all deductions. I have managed to live on that and help my son through college. I have always tried to do the right thing and I am hoping this situation can be corrected immediately.

I can be reached at my home address; it is 8851 E 27th Street, Tucson, AZ 85710 My cell phone number is 520-307-2722. My work number at the University of Arizona is 520-626-6702. Please try my cell phone number until January 5th as the University is closed during this time. I have been employed at the University for 5 Ω years. Before that I was employed at Davidson County Mental in Thomasville, North Carolina for 4 Ω years. I enjoyed my time in North Carolina and I know there are good people there that will help me get this issue corrected.Thank you in advance for anything you can do to assist me in this matter.

Sincerely,

Katherine Flynn

Dear Ms. Weedon, I would ask that you please limit your e-mail copies to the parties involved in this case, it is inappropriate for you to continue to copy all of these folks that are not involved in the case at present, who may possibly become involved in the future.† This claims process should be as impartial as possible.† Additionally, as this case moves forward and we get into the details of the case, the only persons that should be copied on e-mails are the Deputy Commissioner (including his assistant, as permitted by the rules) and defense counsel.† If you choose to represent yourself in this matter, you are subject to the rules as any attorney would be.† Your case is presently scheduled for hearing on February 25th in front of Deputy Commissioner Brad Houser at the I.C.† I have decided to handle this case myself, you may contact me (919-716-6820) if you have any questions on your claim or on procedure in general.† With kind regards.† SPW

Dear Ms. Patrick-Wilson:
Thank you for your email today and for the notification that you will be handling the case. ¬†It is good to have this resolved. ¬†I agree that the process should be as impartial as possible but as much as possible also not put someone without counsel at a disadvantage. ¬†I have been attempting to get information, and my understanding from the court is that I ought to copy the defense counsel, and that I may ask anyone at the North Carolina Industrial Commission for assistance (per Anne Brannen, Deputy Trial Administrator North Carolina Industrial Commission, "As far as who to copy on email correspondence, that is a matter of choice.¬† I will tell you that Deputy Commissioner Philip Baddour no longer has jurisdiction of this case, so there is no added value in continuing to copy Deputy Commissioner Baddour or his Legal Assistant, Sue Baird.¬† Much is the same with Deputy Commissioner John Schafer who manages the Industrial Commission‚Äôs mediation efforts.¬† However, this is solely your decision.").
Today is the first I hear of my case being rescheduled for hearing o n February 25th in front of Deputy Commissioner Houser. ¬†I will copy Deputy Commissioner Houser and his Legal Assistant, Debra Bell and remove Commissioner Baddour and his Legal Assistant, Sue Baird on future correspondence. ¬†However,¬†I am still missing key important information from Form 19 so if you or anyone on the distribution list can help me get this information I would appreciate it.
Sincerely,
Teresa Sorella Weedon

Dear Chance Taylor,



I am responding to a message you sent to the Governors Office regarding hydropower.†



North Carolina (NC) will need a variety of renewable energy sources to build a sustainable energy mix for the future. †Hydropower is certainly one option but almost all of the best hydropower sites have already been developed in NC leaving many smaller sites.† These smaller sites can provide power but if NC wants to tap large amounts of renewable energy sources options like wind, solar, and biomass will also need to be developed.† All power development has some environmental impact.† Hydropower environmental issues include: submerging land and the loss of those ecosystems, downstream impact on water levels and sedimentation, and impact on plants and animals living along the waterway upstream and downstream of proposed dams.† In addition, hydropower energy is dependent on rainfall and stream levels so hydropower energy production is not constant.† Likewise wind, solar, and biomass sources all have their positive and negative points.



NC has no supplies of conventional fuels but we do have access to an array of renewable energy sources that are largely untapped like wind, solar power, biomass, and hyrdropower energy sources.† In addition, there are significant opportunities to utilize conservation technologies to use existing fuels more efficiently.† The State Energy Office has developed a State Energy Plan (see the link at <http://www.energync.net/epc/docs/Energy%20Plan%202005.pdf>http://www.energync.net/epc/docs/Energy%20Plan%202005.pdf ) that explains the current situation and describes strategic options NC can use to become more efficient and make use of renewable energy technologies.†



Thank you for your comments; it is indeed important that NC adopt sustainable energy strategies like hydropower to insure a productive, competitive future. ††



Sincerely,



Bob Leker††††

Dear Governor Easley,

My name is Chance Taylor. I am writing this letter for extra credit in my science class. I am writing this letter about dams, if I want more or less dams in our state, also what kind of dam. I would like more hydroelectric dams. I think hydroelectric power is better than wind power because when the wind stops, it does not give us electricity. The good thing is that water does not stop.

Thank you and please respond.

I have not received this notice as of today Jan 13 2008. I would like to appeal this decision as soon as possible. Can you please email tme the form sent via the mail.††I had a stable job that I was doing fine at prior to†going to Queens. Prior to hiring me they told me they had plenty of business. The first day I started working there they took me†to lunch†and advised me that there business was bad.
Why did't they tell me that before I quit my other job?† During the entire time I worked there the main topic was always lack of† business and lack of hires for the entire office.† Frances also told me that I was about†10 years to old for her to promote into management.
She told all of us†about†6 weeks prior to me losing my job that business was bad and she would need to make some changes if it did not get better. In the last two months that I worked there we had a total of 5 hires and out of those 3 were mine. Including a perm fee of $23000 that they†will received this month.† I know that I did not have enough sumittal and hire but niether did anyone else in the office.
I content that I was too old and that for what ever reason†I did not fit†in there group and†the fact that she did not like me.
Please advise

>> Dear Governor Easley:

I will have to send this email to you in two installments due to the amount of documentation attached.

I have contacted you numerous times about the conduct of the Wilkes County Department of Social Services and have no response from you regarding this issue. I have spoken with someone at the citizen's division and they have continually told me to go through North Carolina DSS, but North DSS continues to ignore my complaint and lied to the Regional office in Atlanta, stating that they had spoken with us, Tim and Kristen Wood and viewed our evidence and stated in a written report that there were no policy violations. This statement by them is untrue. They never spoke with us, nor the Woods, nor did they ever view our evidence.

Furthermore, If there are no policy violations, what is that forged document? Why is there a risk assessment in the file dated October 11, 2006 when at that time, the Social Worker had never even met my husband, nor been to our home? Why is the social worker now charged with Felony Obstruction of Justice and awaiting trial? There were numerous policy and law violations which occurred in our case and they tried to cover them up by forging and falsifying documents. They came after us, because we complained about these violations. I believe Donnie Bumgarner, the director of the Wilkes County Department of Social Services and Mary Henderson CPS supervisor knew that Allison Baker was forging and falsifying documents and that they may have even told her to. I cannot prove that, but statements made to me in recorded phone calls with these individuals leads me to believe that this is the truth.

I understand that you are at the end of your time as the Governor of this state. But before you go, if you could please look at my complaint against the Wilkes County Department of Social Services and do something about their illegal and unethical behavior it could make a difference in not only our lives, but the lives of the children who fall under their protection.

I have contact Benton Dempsey on this matter many times and have never received a response from him. To ignore my complaint does not make it go away, it just furthers the need for an investigation into this manner and their behavior. I have started posting my story publicly with the names included and it is my goal, that this story be known.

Sir, we are wanting our names cleared, they substantiated against us for the sole purpose of discrediting our complaints against them, we did nothing wrong. The substantiation against does not meet any criteria for abuse or neglect and it should be removed. We would also like a written apology from this department as well as a full investigation into their cases and practices, because ours are not the only complaints. The department of Social Services should be held to a higher standard and when they commit policy violations and blatantly break the law they should be held accountable for it. Children's lives depend on their ability to follow these policies and the law. They cannot be allowed to abuse their power in this manner. It is not right.

I have again attached my full complaint and some of the evidence that I have against them to this e-mail. I appreciate your prompt attention in this matter.


Sincerely,

Lisa L. Nixon

>> DESCRIPTION OF DOCUMENTS

>> FORGED SIGNATURE
>> 
>> This is not my husband's signature, whats more this assessment never even occurred. Allison Baker did not begin investigating us until October 25, 2006 as proven by recorded phone calls between myself and her. Two days, I might add, after I called Raleigh and complained about DSS handling of our report of child abuse
>> 
>> ACTUAL SIGNATURE
>> 
>> My husbands actual signature
>> 
>> FIRST LETTER FROM THE DENTIST
>> 
>> This is the letter the dentist wrote about how bad, Lydia's teeth were.
>> TEETH
>> 
>> This is picture of my stepdaughters teeth. My husband told her mother about these cavities December 17, 2005 and the mother allowed Lydia to live in pain for the next 6 months. She would not take her to the dentist, she told my husband if he tried to pick his daughter up from school and took her to the dentist that she would have him arrested, because it was not his custody time. In order to get this little girl to the dentist we had to file for emergency custody, the mother had sent her out of the state in violation of the custody order during his two weeks in June visitation. As soon as we got Lydia, we took her to the dentist. Her teeth were so infected that she had to be put on antibiotic's and a week later had to have these two teeth extracted.

NOTARIZED STATEMENT FROM THE DENTIST
>> 
>> This is the notarized statement that the dentist wrote to tell the judge and DSS just how bad Lydia's teeth were. I think it is plain from the tone of this statement that he felt Lydia had been neglected. The missed appointment that I had to cancel was one that I had made and her mother refused to take her to, stating that she had scheduled her an appointment with her "usual dentist", whom Lydia had not seen in three years. Lydia's appointment with her "usual dentist" was cancelled several times, until we pushed the issue.

LETTER CLOSING THE CASE FROM WILKES COUNTY
>> 
>> If you read this letter it includes the statement by the SW for us to continue to monitor Lydia's care from her mother. Now, why, if the mother is doing what she is supposed to do to take care of her child, do we need to continue to monitor her care from her mother? The day they closed the case I made a report because Lydia had bruises around her upper arm that looked like someone had grabbed her by the arm. The therapist that we were taking her to saw these bruises and felt that they were suspicious as well but that they weren't fresh enough for him to make a report...They screened this report out because I didn't state who had abused her...another stupid reason for screening out a report.

LETTER FROM SURRY COUNTY DSS CLOSING THE CASE
>> 
>> This is the letter from Surry County DSS that not only proves when the in home services agreement was made but also directly contradicts the letter to the Judge and their findings that we were not complying with them.

LETTER TO THE JUDGE page 1
>> 
>> This letter is nothing but lies and is nothing like what the SW told me in a recorded phone call that she was going to write. We did everything they ever asked us to do, while they had to fight with the mother every step of the way. We did not fight with the mother, but would call her on it when she was not fulfilling her duties as Lydia and her sisters mother. The mother would lie to DSS, still would not let them come to her home or let them see the girls.
>> 
>> 
>> LETTER TO THE JUDGE page 2
>> 
>> I love the first paragraph on this page, tell me if you break a child's arm and it heals without permanent damage is it no longer abuse? If you don't take your child to the dentist and leave her with a toothache for over 6 month, does it stop being neglect, because those teeth are pulled? No it is still abuse, the physical ailment may have healed but that doesn't take away the neglect.

REPORT NOT ACCEPTED
>> 
>> This is the reason that they gave for not accepting the report that I made about the bruises on Lydia. "The child is not stating that anything adverse has happened to her." Since when does a child have to state that they are being abused for an investigation to be done. Children do not always disclose and the thing that always got me about this was the fact that they had not talked to the child at all.

MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION CONSENT FORM
If you look at this document you will see that the consent from the parents was received through intimidation and coerision. The parents were led to believe that they had no choice but to sign this document because they believed that it had been order by the County Director.

IN HOME FAMILY SERVICES AGREEMENT PAGES 1 THROUGH 6

Please note that the criteria on the Family Services Agreement is supposed to come from the Strengths and Needs Assessment. These don't.
The second page, first they are saying that David is to get medical and dental insurance on Lydia, so that inability to pay will not be an excuse not to receive treatment. This is wrong for the following reason:

1. David had insurance on Lydia when her mother neglected to take her to the dentist before.

2. David lost said insurance coverage and his job, because of DSS. Their failure to investigate this case in a timely manner, causing numerous postponements in the court case and their missed appointments were the reason he lost his job and the insurance coverage.

3. Lydia was covered under medicaid on this date.

4. This is not a DSS matter, this is a child support issue and David was well within the order of the court, which states, "when insurance is made avalible through the employer." It had not been made avalible through his employer, because David had just started a new job because DSS made him loose the other one.

5. This is not abuse, what the mother did when she would not take the girls to the dentist even though they had insurance and medicaid, that is abuse.

Page 3 In Home Family Service Agreement

Exchanges between the parents be as amicable as possible. They always had been and I have a years worth of video proving it. When the mother would yell and cuss at us we would walk away, we would not comment or we would say thank you.

DSS was well aware that there was not arguing occurring at the exchanges, because they had seen some of the video's and made inappropriate comments about the parents acting like robots, and not acting human. So which is it DSS?

Also on page 3 note that David is to attend all sessions for counseling that Tammy and David provide for Lydia. Follow the recommendations of the counselor. 3 sessions? That was all they wanted, what good does that do? Plus their own Strengths and Needs state that the child has minumal problems, what child doesn't.

Page 4 In Home Family Services Agreement

The threat of Foster Care....

Under the section of what it will take for the case to close, the only thing listed is that at least 3 counseling sessions be met. Then they closed this case before those sessions were met, saying that the order had come down to close the case, that they did not care if the counseling was completed or not.

Page 6 In Home Family Services Agreement

This is what I thought then and it is still what I think now, with one exception, after the lies that Linda Brooks told I now believe her to be just as guilty as the rest.
That concludes the In Home Family Services Agreement...tell me where is the abuse?
>> 
>> COMPLAINT AGAINST WILKES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SEVICES

This lays out our entire complaint

RISK ASSESSMENT page 1
>> 
>> Read this carefully and look at what they used to keep the case open, this is not child abuse or neglect in anyway shape or form. They mark a one on lines R8 and R9 saying that we weren't complying with the in home services agreement, on this date, there was no in home services agreement. So exactly how were we failing to comply with something that did not exist? If you read the letter from Surry County DSS, it directly contradicts these findings stating that we complied with everything DSS ever told us to do and then it lists the date the in home services agreement was created.
>> 
>> Furthermore, when one was created all it said on it was for my husband to get dental insurance on Lydia and that the pick up and drops off should go smoothly without any arguments.
>> 
>> My husband had dental insurance on Lydia when her mother wouldn't take her to the dentist before and had kept coverage on her for years. We lost the insurance when he lost his job, due to DSS's failure to investigate our report in a timely manner. Because they did not do their job, the civil action we had filed kept being postponed awaiting their findings, my husband had to keep asking for days off to be in court. Then DSS missed the appointment with the psychologist and it had to be postponed, so he had to ask for another day, which resulted in him being let go because he missed too much work. I guess what really gets me is they acted like the mother couldn't take Lydia to the dentist if he didn't have insurance, but she had her on medicaid the entire time.
>> 
>> RISK ASSESSMENT page 1
>> 
>> Look at our score on this risk assessment, it is in the low box, and if you take off the boxes that they marked on the first page because it wasn't true, then our actual score would have been a one. They knew they had nothing on us to substantiate against us for, they knew they had no reason for leaving this case open...so they made something up. Even with the score they gave us, they still had to do an override, because according to their own paper work, if the score is that low they are supposed to not substantiate or keep the case open, so they lied about us not complying with the case plan in order to leave the case open.
>> 
>> RISK ASSESSMENT SECOND page 1

Pay attention to R8 and R9, now it says that we are complying and the only thing we receive a point on is my husband's age...yet they still override this low score by stating that we are not complying with the cft of 9-11-07 there was no In Home Services Agreement on this date. Furthermore they state in this that we are "Succesfully completed all programs recommended or actively participation in programs; pursuing objectives detailed in service agreement."

RISK ASSESSMENT SECOND page 2

Discretionary Override: This is a complete lie, by their own admission on this document.

RISK ASSESSMENT THIRD page 1 and 2

This says the same thing as the previous Risk Assessment, but note that the Discretionary Override is missing. So why did they override it before and not now. They never had a case against us, we never committed any kind of abuse. They did all of this to discredit our valid complaints against them, because in their minds they felt that if they made us into child abusers, no one would listen to our complaints.

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT page 1

Good parenting skills, then why are you bothering us???

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT page 2

Look at the strengths, now look at the needs

Minor child Characteristics...What child doesn't but of course she has minor characteristic's her mother had been married 3 times in four years and was constantly bring men in and out of the children's lives introducing them to the children as this is you "new daddy". Furthermore, the mother was mentally ill. Which I might point out we were not.

Underemployed...Only because my husband lost his job because of them.

Caregiver Neglected as a child...Yes I was abused and neglect, but by their own hand I have good parenting skills. I was abused as a child...I am 38 now. Tell me what this has to do with anything?

Childs needs;

Tutoring: Well she lives with her mother fulltime, that falls on her shoulders although before DSS involvement we had already been going to the school and picking up her school work and making her make up on our every other weekend visits.

Speech problem: Again we had already contacted the school before DSS involvement about Lydia's speech and were told by them that she did not need therapy.

Not seeing Counselor: David and I had been trying to get Lydia to a counselor for years before DSS involvement, the mother would not let her go and it is hard to find someone to take her on the weekend.

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS SECOND ASSESSMENT pages 1 and 2

This says the same thing as the First, it still states that we have good parenting skills, so why are they bothering us?
>> STRENGTHS AND NEEDS THIRD ASSESSMENT pages 1 and 2
This says the same thing as the First, except now I guess the jobs we had were good enough, it still states that we have good parenting skills, so why are they bothering us?
>> 
>> PETITION FILED BY DSS TO GET THE MOTHER TO COMPLY page 1
>> 
>> This is the petition that DSS filed the same day, just mere hours, after I called them and asked them why they had done nothing about Tammy's failure to attend and take Lydia and her sister to the psychologist for the evaluation. They dismissed this petition, because after they filed it she took the girls and herself.
>> 
>> PETITION FILED BY DSS TO GET THE MOTHER TO COMPLY page 2
>> 
>> If you read this page, it basically tells you that we have done what we were supposed to, while the mother had not. She would not even set up times so the SW could check on the girls, yet they dismissed the petition. The other thing I found funny was that they went after her for failing to take the girl's to the mental health evaluation, but would not do anything about her not taking them to the dentist. As a matter of fact, L:ydia's sisters teeth were not fixed until her last appointment with the psychologist, almost a year after they received their report.
>> †
SECOND REPORT NOT ACCEPTED

This is another report that I made because Lydia had bruises on her upper right arm that looked as if someone grabbed her. The psychologist say these bruises too and felt they were suspecious, but did not report them because he was unsure of what caused them. He did state he would be watching Lydia more closely in the future. Look at why they screened this one out....

LETTER FROM DSS ATTORNEY MR. FREEMAN

In my view this is a very intimidating letter sent to try and shut me up. I am asking for more documentation because I feel that their are more forgeries and falsified documents in the file. I believe they do not want me to have them because there are more forgeries and falsified documents in the file. I love how he states that the case is closed. Closed or not it does not excuse their behavior in this case, nor does it end their liability.

JUDGE BYRD'S ORDER DATED NOVEMBER 20, 2006 pages 1 and 2

If you notice in this order Judge Byrd orders DSS to submit a written report of all findings, this was in November of 06. They did not submit their findings to him until May 08, and then it is not even the truth but lies. All Judge Byrd received from them was the psychologist report that was full of BS and this letter that was also full of BS. Just how long do you think you have to comply with a Judges order?
Note the first paragraph on the second page, so does this mean if you break your child's arm and there is no permenant damage that it is not abuse?

SECOND LETTER FROM DSS ATTORNEY MR. FREEMAN

Again with the intimidation.
>> 
>> 
>> ALLISON S. BAKERS CRIMINAL BACKGROUND SEARCH Pages 3 and 4
>> 
>> This is the background check I had done on Allison S. Baker, the original Social Worker, at the Wilkes County Courthouse, May 15, 2007. As you can see Mrs. Baker has been charged with 8 Counts of Forgery, Obtain Control Substance by Fraud/Forgery. These Charges were knocked down to misdemeanor, possession of a controlled substance to which she was sentenced to probation and community service and when she complied with that they did what is known as a 90 96 Review and dismissed the charges. The point remains, someone who has been charged like this should not be working for Social Services where they remove children from the home for substance abuse by the parents.

INITIAL CASE PLAN, DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS

Nikki Hull brought this to our house when she came August 20, 2007. Even she said that this stuff made no sense as DSS is not supposed to involve themselves in custody issues. Nothing on this was ever set up or scheduled by DSS. Now if this is what they are talking about in the Risk Assessments they are responsible for setting this stuff up and they never did. In fact we were told that they decided not to use this.† But I fail to see how this could be what they are talking about, due to the date that they mention on the risk assessments, on those the date is September 11, 2007.

Dear Governor Easley,

I understand you were interviewed last week by a local television station regarding tornado warning systems and other severe weather notification capabilities. I was traveling and missed the broadcast, but was told you talked about siren based solutions. Additionally, I read several articles in the News and Observer where you expressed a genuine interest in indentifying solutions that help protect people and their property in our state. One such article written recently by Martha Quillin, ìRadios best bet against twistersî (http://www.newsobserver.com/print/sunday/city_state/story/1306204.html) was particularly interesting.

This article stated that information provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will help protect lives and property and that everyone should buy a NOAA radio. That will only help if youíre sitting next to the radio in a time of need. I am a founder and Chairman of the Board at a RTP based start-up company Velleros, Inc. At Velleros, we believe there is a better way to get this critical and time sensitive information to people in harms way. Velleros has created a carrier grade mass alerting and notification application that enables telecom carriers to reliably notify their subscriber customers of time-sensitive events such as tornados, tsunamis, severe thunderstorms, child abductions, chemical spills, civil emergencies, and product recalls. With regard to the weather alerting capability, Velleros polls NOAA every few seconds and can send customized voice or text messages to multiple end devices such as mobile phones, land lines and computers in the form of voice calls, emails, pop ups or text messages just to mention a few. Because itís customizable, the Velleros platform can be configured to call you and wake you in the event of eminent danger from threatening weather by ringing your mobile and/or home telephone(s).

In addition to the weather service alerts and notifications, Velleros provides community-based notification features that enable Universities and State-and-Local Governments to reliably notify their respective communities of emergency situations or other time sensitive and important information. Vellerosí alerting and notification applications are also planned to be compliant with requirements for a new capability mandated by U.S Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Commercial Mobile Alerting System (CMAS). CMAS is based on the Warning and Response Network Act (the WARN Act) legislation passed by U.S. Congress in 2006. The WARN Act seeks to leverage carrier mobile phone networks and technology to augment the current radio and television based emergency broadcast system in the United States. CMAS deployment in the U.S. is forecasted for 2009-2010 and will include four levels of alerts of which one is severe or threatening weather.

I would like to talk with you or someone at you office about how best to use the Velleros platform to protect people and property in our state. I can be reached at my Velleros email account, jwhitehurst@velleros.com or my mobile at 469-583-5227.


Best Regards,

Jay Whitehurst

Dear Mr. Benton:

I have sent you several e-mails and have yet to receive a response from you.† It is my understanding that as the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Service and according to General Statute 108A-74 you owe a duty to look into my complaint and fix the problem.†

I am asking you to conduct an investigation into the Wilkes County Department of Social Services and their handling of our report of child abuse, the falsified and forged documents, the vindictive and unethical manner in which they treated us during the course of their investigation and† the decision made against us.† I will state for the record that they maliciously came after us to discredit our complaints against them and did not begin investigating us until after we complained to†North Carolina DSS in Raleigh, specifically Phyllis Fulton on October 23, 2006.

By requesting an investigation, I mean go look at the file, speak to us and our witnesses, view our evidence, speak to Detective Chris Handy at the Wilkesboro Police Department, who handled the investigation into the forged documents, speak with the DA who is taking this very seriously and prosecuting Mrs. Baker.†I know it was stated to AFC and specifically Ruth Walker that North Carolina Department of Social Services conducted an investigation into our complaint and no policy violations were found, but that is a lie.† North Carolina Department of Social Services also stated that had spoken with us and Tim and Kristen Wood and viewed our evidence, that is also a lie.† If there were no policy violations then why is Allison Baker being tried by the Wilkes County DA for Felony Obstruction of Justice for forging documents in this investigation.† If that isn't a policy violation then I don't know what is.† By ignoring†our complaint and failing to rectify this situation you are, as the Principle of the Wilkes County Department of Social Services, just as guilty of wrong doing as they are.

Furthermore, the whole case decision, mental health evaluation, everything in this case is based on lies, falsified documents or forgeries.† Allison Baker also falsified the Risk Assessment dated 10/11/06, the Family Strengths and Needs Assessment dated 10/11/06, how can you fill out these forms when you have never met the parent?††Allison Baker†is the person who spoke with the psychologist who performed the mental health evaluation and the record that he received to do his investigation with, contained these falsified and forged†documents.†

Everything in this case is a lie, fabrication, or forgery from the safety assessment dated 8/17/06 which also has a forgery of David's signature, to the letter to Judge Byrd Written by Linda Brooks when this case was closed in May.† We always worked with DSS even when we†felt they were maliciously prosecuting us, behaving unethically, and forging documents and lying.† I have attached our full complaint to this e-mail.† I have†attached most of the documentation that I have to this email, if you read it will you realize that my complaints are true and that the unethical and illegal behavior that occurred in this case must be rectified.† The forged signature and the real signature is also attached,†you compare them and then tell me that there were no policy violations.††It is my contention that not only did Allison Baker forge David's signature, but Mary Henderson was aware of it as was Donnie Bumgarner.† I believe they may have even told her to†do it.† My reason behind this is because of phone conversations I had with†both of them.†

Your web page states:

"Mission and Philosophy

The mission of the Department of Health and Human Services is to provide efficient services that enhance the quality of life of North Carolina individuals and families so that they have opportunities for healthier and safer lives resulting ultimately in the achievement of economic and personal independence.
The department is devoted to <http://www.ncdhhs.gov/cstf/>quality customer service. We welcome<http://www.ncdhhs.gov/cstf/voice.htm> your input and suggestions to how we can improve."

Yet I have contacted you numerous times about the illegal and unethical practice of a county office that answers directly to you and you have done nothing.† If something is not done about this complaint within the next 2 weeks, we feel we have no choice but to file a lawsuit against the Wilkes County DSS, and the employees involved in this case as well as the NCDSS and you and several of your employees.† The damage that has been done to us in this case cannot be undone, but the problem could have been resolved with an actual investigation into their wrong doings, removal of the substantiation and a written apology, we have received none of those things. We are prepared to do whatever is in our power to clear our good name and remove the†libel and slanderous†substantiation against us.†

What upsets me the most is if they acted like this in our case, how many other cases are they doing the same things in.† How many children are slipping through the cracks because of their law violations, policy violations unethical behavior.† How many lives are they ruining with their abuse of power?

I have sent you this documentation in two seperate emails.† The other is to follow shortly it will have a list of the documents and a description of each and why it is significant.

Sincerely,


Lisa L. Nixon

Dear Mr. Benton:

This is the second installment of most of the documentation I have, if you read it and the description below, you will find that I am telling the truth in this matter.† For you to continue to ignore my complaint when you have seen the proof of the wrongs that they have committed shows a complete disregard for you position and job description as well as your own policy.† I believe it also makes you just as guilty as they are.

Below is a description of the documents attached to both of the emails I just sent you.† Look at the documents, then read the documentation for each.†I am asking you to conduct a full investigation into this matter, remove the substantation against me, my husband, Tim and Kristen Wood and Bradley Groce because it is the right thing to do.††And fix the problems with the Wilkes County Department of Social Services before they are able to do this to even more people.† Because they are behaving this way in other cases.†

Sincerely,

Lisa L. Nixon

DESCRIPTION OF DOCUMENTS

FORGED SIGNATURE

This is not my husband's signature, whats more this assessment never even occurred. Allison Baker did not begin investigating us until October 25, 2006 as proven by recorded phone calls between myself and her. Two days, I might add, after I called Raleigh and complained about DSS handling of our report of child abuse

ACTUAL SIGNATURE

My husbands actual signature

FIRST LETTER FROM THE DENTIST

This is the letter the dentist wrote about how bad, Lydia's teeth were.
TEETH

This is picture of my stepdaughters teeth. My husband told her mother about these cavities December 17, 2005 and the mother allowed Lydia to live in pain for the next 6 months. She would not take her to the dentist, she told my husband if he tried to pick his daughter up from school and took her to the dentist that she would have him arrested, because it was not his custody time. In order to get this little girl to the dentist we had to file for emergency custody, the mother had sent her out of the state in violation of the custody order during his two weeks in June visitation. As soon as we got Lydia, we took her to the dentist. Her teeth were so infected that she had to be put on antibiotic's and a week later had to have these two teeth extracted.

NOTARIZED STATEMENT FROM THE DENTIST

This is the notarized statement that the dentist wrote to tell the judge and DSS just how bad Lydia's teeth were. I think it is plain from the tone of this statement that he felt Lydia had been neglected. The missed appointment that I had to cancel was one that I had made and her mother refused to take her to, stating that she had scheduled her an appointment with her "usual dentist", whom Lydia had not seen in three years. Lydia's appointment with her "usual dentist" was cancelled several times, until we pushed the issue.

LETTER CLOSING THE CASE FROM WILKES COUNTY

If you read this letter it includes the statement by the SW for us to continue to monitor Lydia's care from her mother. Now, why, if the mother is doing what she is supposed to do to take care of her child, do we need to continue to monitor her care from her mother? The day they closed the case I made a report because Lydia had bruises around her upper arm that looked like someone had grabbed her by the arm. The therapist that we were taking her to saw these bruises and felt that they were suspicious as well but that they weren't fresh enough for him to make a report...They screened this report out because I didn't state who had abused her...another stupid reason for screening out a report.

LETTER FROM SURRY COUNTY DSS CLOSING THE CASE

This is the letter from Surry County DSS that not only proves when the in home services agreement was made but also directly contradicts the letter to the Judge and their findings that we were not complying with them.

LETTER TO THE JUDGE page 1

This letter is nothing but lies and is nothing like what the SW told me in a recorded phone call that she was going to write. We did everything they ever asked us to do, while they had to fight with the mother every step of the way. We did not fight with the mother, but would call her on it when she was not fulfilling her duties as Lydia and her sisters mother. The mother would lie to DSS, still would not let them come to her home or let them see the girls.


LETTER TO THE JUDGE page 2

I love the first paragraph on this page, tell me if you break a child's arm and it heals without permanent damage is it no longer abuse? If you don't take your child to the dentist and leave her with a toothache for over 6 month, does it stop being neglect, because those teeth are pulled? No it is still abuse, the physical ailment may have healed but that doesn't take away the neglect.

REPORT NOT ACCEPTED

This is the reason that they gave for not accepting the report that I made about the bruises on Lydia. "The child is not stating that anything adverse has happened to her." Since when does a child have to state that they are being abused for an investigation to be done. Children do not always disclose and the thing that always got me about this was the fact that they had not talked to the child at all.

MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION CONSENT FORM
If you look at this document you will see that the consent from the parents was received through intimidation and coerision. The parents were led to believe that they had no choice but to sign this document because they believed that it had been order by the County Director.

IN HOME FAMILY SERVICES AGREEMENT PAGES 1 THROUGH 6

Please note that the criteria on the Family Services Agreement is supposed to come from the Strengths and Needs Assessment. These don't.
The second page, first they are saying that David is to get medical and dental insurance on Lydia, so that inability to pay will not be an excuse not to receive treatment. This is wrong for the following reason:

1. David had insurance on Lydia when her mother neglected to take her to the dentist before.

2. David lost said insurance coverage and his job, because of DSS. Their failure to investigate this case in a timely manner, causing numerous postponements in the court case and their missed appointments were the reason he lost his job and the insurance coverage.

3. Lydia was covered under medicaid on this date.

4. This is not a DSS matter, this is a child support issue and David was well within the order of the court, which states, "when insurance is made avalible through the employer." It had not been made avalible through his employer, because David had just started a new job because DSS made him loose the other one.

5. This is not abuse, what the mother did when she would not take the girls to the dentist even though they had insurance and medicaid, that is abuse.

Page 3 In Home Family Service Agreement

Exchanges between the parents be as amicable as possible. They always had been and I have a years worth of video proving it. When the mother would yell and cuss at us we would walk away, we would not comment or we would say thank you.

DSS was well aware that there was not arguing occurring at the exchanges, because they had seen some of the video's and made inappropriate comments about the parents acting like robots, and not acting human. So which is it DSS?

Also on page 3 note that David is to attend all sessions for counseling that Tammy and David provide for Lydia. Follow the recommendations of the counselor. 3 sessions? That was all they wanted, what good does that do? Plus their own Strengths and Needs state that the child has minumal problems, what child doesn't.

Page 4 In Home Family Services Agreement

The threat of Foster Care....

Under the section of what it will take for the case to close, the only thing listed is that at least 3 counseling sessions be met. Then they closed this case before those sessions were met, saying that the order had come down to close the case, that they did not care if the counseling was completed or not.

Page 6 In Home Family Services Agreement

This is what I thought then and it is still what I think now, with one exception, after the lies that Linda Brooks told I now believe her to be just as guilty as the rest.
That concludes the In Home Family Services Agreement...tell me where is the abuse?

COMPLAINT AGAINST WILKES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SEVICES

This lays out our entire complaint

RISK ASSESSMENT page 1

Read this carefully and look at what they used to keep the case open, this is not child abuse or neglect in anyway shape or form. They mark a one on lines R8 and R9 saying that we weren't complying with the in home services agreement, on this date, there was no in home services agreement. So exactly how were we failing to comply with something that did not exist? If you read the letter from Surry County DSS, it directly contradicts these findings stating that we complied with everything DSS ever told us to do and then it lists the date the in home services agreement was created.

Furthermore, when one was created all it said on it was for my husband to get dental insurance on Lydia and that the pick up and drops off should go smoothly without any arguments.

My husband had dental insurance on Lydia when her mother wouldn't take her to the dentist before and had kept coverage on her for years. We lost the insurance when he lost his job, due to DSS's failure to investigate our report in a timely manner. Because they did not do their job, the civil action we had filed kept being postponed awaiting their findings, my husband had to keep asking for days off to be in court. Then DSS missed the appointment with the psychologist and it had to be postponed, so he had to ask for another day, which resulted in him being let go because he missed too much work. I guess what really gets me is they acted like the mother couldn't take Lydia to the dentist if he didn't have insurance, but she had her on medicaid the entire time.

RISK ASSESSMENT page 1

Look at our score on this risk assessment, it is in the low box, and if you take off the boxes that they marked on the first page because it wasn't true, then our actual score would have been a one. They knew they had nothing on us to substantiate against us for, they knew they had no reason for leaving this case open...so they made something up. Even with the score they gave us, they still had to do an override, because according to their own paper work, if the score is that low they are supposed to not substantiate or keep the case open, so they lied about us not complying with the case plan in order to leave the case open.

RISK ASSESSMENT SECOND page 1

Pay attention to R8 and R9, now it says that we are complying and the only thing we receive a point on is my husband's age...yet they still override this low score by stating that we are not complying with the cft of 9-11-07 there was no In Home Services Agreement on this date. Furthermore they state in this that we are "Succesfully completed all programs recommended or actively participation in programs; pursuing objectives detailed in service agreement."

RISK ASSESSMENT SECOND page 2

Discretionary Override: This is a complete lie, by their own admission on this document.

RISK ASSESSMENT THIRD page 1 and 2

This says the same thing as the previous Risk Assessment, but note that the Discretionary Override is missing. So why did they override it before and not now. They never had a case against us, we never committed any kind of abuse. They did all of this to discredit our valid complaints against them, because in their minds they felt that if they made us into child abusers, no one would listen to our complaints.

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT page 1

Good parenting skills, then why are you bothering us???

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT page 2

Look at the strengths, now look at the needs

Minor child Characteristics...What child doesn't but of course she has minor characteristic's her mother had been married 3 times in four years and was constantly bring men in and out of the children's lives introducing them to the children as this is you "new daddy". Furthermore, the mother was mentally ill. Which I might point out we were not.

Underemployed...Only because my husband lost his job because of them.

Caregiver Neglected as a child...Yes I was abused and neglect, but by their own hand I have good parenting skills. I was abused as a child...I am 38 now. Tell me what this has to do with anything?

Childs needs;

Tutoring: Well she lives with her mother fulltime, that falls on her shoulders although before DSS involvement we had already been going to the school and picking up her school work and making her make up on our every other weekend visits.

Speech problem: Again we had already contacted the school before DSS involvement about Lydia's speech and were told by them that she did not need therapy.

Not seeing Counselor: David and I had been trying to get Lydia to a counselor for years before DSS involvement, the mother would not let her go and it is hard to find someone to take her on the weekend.

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS SECOND ASSESSMENT pages 1 and 2

This says the same thing as the First, it still states that we have good parenting skills, so why are they bothering us?
STRENGTHS AND NEEDS THIRD ASSESSMENT pages 1 and 2
This says the same thing as the First, except now I guess the jobs we had were good enough, it still states that we have good parenting skills, so why are they bothering us?

PETITION FILED BY DSS TO GET THE MOTHER TO COMPLY page 1

This is the petition that DSS filed the same day, just mere hours, after I called them and asked them why they had done nothing about Tammy's failure to attend and take Lydia and her sister to the psychologist for the evaluation. They dismissed this petition, because after they filed it she took the girls and herself.

PETITION FILED BY DSS TO GET THE MOTHER TO COMPLY page 2

If you read this page, it basically tells you that we have done what we were supposed to, while the mother had not. She would not even set up times so the SW could check on the girls, yet they dismissed the petition. The other thing I found funny was that they went after her for failing to take the girl's to the mental health evaluation, but would not do anything about her not taking them to the dentist. As a matter of fact, L:ydia's sisters teeth were not fixed until her last appointment with the psychologist, almost a year after they received their report.

SECOND REPORT NOT ACCEPTED

This is another report that I made because Lydia had bruises on her upper right arm that looked as if someone grabbed her. The psychologist say these bruises too and felt they were suspecious, but did not report them because he was unsure of what caused them. He did state he would be watching Lydia more closely in the future. Look at why they screened this one out....

LETTER FROM DSS ATTORNEY MR. FREEMAN

In my view this is a very intimidating letter sent to try and shut me up. I am asking for more documentation because I feel that their are more forgeries and falsified documents in the file. I believe they do not want me to have them because there are more forgeries and falsified documents in the file. I love how he states that the case is closed. Closed or not it does not excuse their behavior in this case, nor does it end their liability.

JUDGE BYRD'S ORDER DATED NOVEMBER 20, 2006 pages 1 and 2

If you notice in this order Judge Byrd orders DSS to submit a written report of all findings, this was in November of 06. They did not submit their findings to him until May 08, and then it is not even the truth but lies. All Judge Byrd received from them was the psychologist report that was full of BS and this letter that was also full of BS. Just how long do you think you have to comply with a Judges order?
Note the first paragraph on the second page, so does this mean if you break your child's arm and there is no permenant damage that it is not abuse?

SECOND LETTER FROM DSS ATTORNEY MR. FREEMAN

Again with the intimidation.


ALLISON S. BAKERS CRIMINAL BACKGROUND SEARCH Pages 3 and 4

This is the background check I had done on Allison S. Baker, the original Social Worker, at the Wilkes County Courthouse, May 15, 2007. As you can see Mrs. Baker has been charged with 8 Counts of Forgery, Obtain Control Substance by Fraud/Forgery. These Charges were knocked down to misdemeanor, possession of a controlled substance to which she was sentenced to probation and community service and when she complied with that they did what is known as a 90 96 Review and dismissed the charges. The point remains, someone who has been charged like this should not be working for Social Services where they remove children from the home for substance abuse by the parents.

INITIAL CASE PLAN, DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS

Nikki Hull brought this to our house when she came August 20, 2007. Even she said that this stuff made no sense as DSS is not supposed to involve themselves in custody issues. Nothing on this was ever set up or scheduled by DSS. Now if this is what they are talking about in the Risk Assessments they are responsible for setting this stuff up and they never did. In fact we were told that they decided not to use this.† But I fail to see how this could be what they are talking about, due to the date that they mention on the risk assessments, on those the date is September 11, 2007.

Dear Mr. Cansler:

It is my understanding that you are the new Director of The North Carolina Department and Health and Human Services.† I sincerely hope you are a better director then Mr. Benton, who I have contacted on several occasions with documented proof of forged documents, Statutory Law violations, welfare policy violations committed against us by the Wilkes County Department of Social Services, only to never receive any kind of a response from him.

I know that you are new and I am sure that some of the people in your office will tell you that what I am saying isn't the truth, but I can assure you it is and some of your employees helped cover it up.

I am asking you to view the documents that I have sent you, I suggest starting with the revised complaint against WCDSS, then view the forged signature and the actual signature on the safety assessments done by Allison Baker, who has by the way, been arrested and is awaiting trial for Felony Obstruction of Justice in regards to our case.

I have had to send all of this documentation in two installments, I ask that you read all of them, at the bottom of the second email is a description of all the documents attached, read them all, contact and speak with me†because I also have recorded phone conversations that verify my complaint.†† Then I ask that you conduct a full investigation into the Wilkes County Department of Social Services and their handling of not only our case, but of several others I can tell you about.

What I want: I would like the substantiation removed from me and my husband, David R. Nixon as well as Tim and Kristen Wood and Bradley Groce, because it is my belief we were substantiated against to discredit our complaints against them.† We did not do anything that even remotely resembled child abuse of neglect.† The reason they said they substantiated against us was due to parents inability to get along, we did everything in our power to get along with Mrs. Groce and I can prove this by recorded telephone conversations and video of the pick up and drop offs.†

Furthermore, their claim does not fit statutory guidelines for neglect and if parents inability to get along was actual abuse you would have to substantiate against everyone at some point.

Mr. Cansler, we have been maliciously persecuted by the Wilkes County Department of Social Services.† What has been done to us is a travesty of justice, and not only unethical, but illegal.† When CPS acts like this children die, this cannot be allowed to continue.†

Please read my complaint, view my documentation and then do something to fix what has been done to us.† We are not child abusers, we were trying to protect two little girls and when we made our report and WCDSS failed in their statutory duties we complained and they punished us for it.

When we went to the regional level NCDSS stated that they had spoken with us and Tim and Kristen Wood†and viewed our evidence, this was a lie.† They never spoke with us or viewed our evidence, someone spoke with me by phone before I contacted Atlanta, but never did anything like they stated to ACF.† And no one from NCDSS ever spoke with Tim and Kristen†Wood!†

You are viewed as the principle in a†principle, agent relationship with WCDSS, you have the power to rectify this situation, I am asking that you do so.†

I can be reached at 336-874-8133

Sincerely,

Lisa L. Nixon

>> DESCRIPTION OF DOCUMENTS

>> FORGED SIGNATURE
>> 
>> This is not my husband's signature, whats more this assessment never even occurred. Allison Baker did not begin investigating us until October 25, 2006 as proven by recorded phone calls between myself and her. Two days, I might add, after I called Raleigh and complained about DSS handling of our report of child abuse
>> 
>> ACTUAL SIGNATURE
>> 
>> My husbands actual signature
>> 
>> FIRST LETTER FROM THE DENTIST
>> 
>> This is the letter the dentist wrote about how bad, Lydia's teeth were.
>> TEETH
>> 
>> This is picture of my stepdaughters teeth. My husband told her mother about these cavities December 17, 2005 and the mother allowed Lydia to live in pain for the next 6 months. She would not take her to the dentist, she told my husband if he tried to pick his daughter up from school and took her to the dentist that she would have him arrested, because it was not his custody time. In order to get this little girl to the dentist we had to file for emergency custody, the mother had sent her out of the state in violation of the custody order during his two weeks in June visitation. As soon as we got Lydia, we took her to the dentist. Her teeth were so infected that she had to be put on antibiotic's and a week later had to have these two teeth extracted.

NOTARIZED STATEMENT FROM THE DENTIST
>> 
>> This is the notarized statement that the dentist wrote to tell the judge and DSS just how bad Lydia's teeth were. I think it is plain from the tone of this statement that he felt Lydia had been neglected. The missed appointment that I had to cancel was one that I had made and her mother refused to take her to, stating that she had scheduled her an appointment with her "usual dentist", whom Lydia had not seen in three years. Lydia's appointment with her "usual dentist" was cancelled several times, until we pushed the issue.

LETTER CLOSING THE CASE FROM WILKES COUNTY
>> 
>> If you read this letter it includes the statement by the SW for us to continue to monitor Lydia's care from her mother. Now, why, if the mother is doing what she is supposed to do to take care of her child, do we need to continue to monitor her care from her mother? The day they closed the case I made a report because Lydia had bruises around her upper arm that looked like someone had grabbed her by the arm. The therapist that we were taking her to saw these bruises and felt that they were suspicious as well but that they weren't fresh enough for him to make a report...They screened this report out because I didn't state who had abused her...another stupid reason for screening out a report.

LETTER FROM SURRY COUNTY DSS CLOSING THE CASE
>> 
>> This is the letter from Surry County DSS that not only proves when the in home services agreement was made but also directly contradicts the letter to the Judge and their findings that we were not complying with them.

LETTER TO THE JUDGE page 1
>> 
>> This letter is nothing but lies and is nothing like what the SW told me in a recorded phone call that she was going to write. We did everything they ever asked us to do, while they had to fight with the mother every step of the way. We did not fight with the mother, but would call her on it when she was not fulfilling her duties as Lydia and her sisters mother. The mother would lie to DSS, still would not let them come to her home or let them see the girls.
>> 
>> 
>> LETTER TO THE JUDGE page 2
>> 
>> I love the first paragraph on this page, tell me if you break a child's arm and it heals without permanent damage is it no longer abuse? If you don't take your child to the dentist and leave her with a toothache for over 6 month, does it stop being neglect, because those teeth are pulled? No it is still abuse, the physical ailment may have healed but that doesn't take away the neglect.

REPORT NOT ACCEPTED
>> 
>> This is the reason that they gave for not accepting the report that I made about the bruises on Lydia. "The child is not stating that anything adverse has happened to her." Since when does a child have to state that they are being abused for an investigation to be done. Children do not always disclose and the thing that always got me about this was the fact that they had not talked to the child at all.

MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION CONSENT FORM
If you look at this document you will see that the consent from the parents was received through intimidation and coerision. The parents were led to believe that they had no choice but to sign this document because they believed that it had been order by the County Director.

IN HOME FAMILY SERVICES AGREEMENT PAGES 1 THROUGH 6

Please note that the criteria on the Family Services Agreement is supposed to come from the Strengths and Needs Assessment. These don't.
The second page, first they are saying that David is to get medical and dental insurance on Lydia, so that inability to pay will not be an excuse not to receive treatment. This is wrong for the following reason:

1. David had insurance on Lydia when her mother neglected to take her to the dentist before.

2. David lost said insurance coverage and his job, because of DSS. Their failure to investigate this case in a timely manner, causing numerous postponements in the court case and their missed appointments were the reason he lost his job and the insurance coverage.

3. Lydia was covered under medicaid on this date.

4. This is not a DSS matter, this is a child support issue and David was well within the order of the court, which states, "when insurance is made avalible through the employer." It had not been made avalible through his employer, because David had just started a new job because DSS made him loose the other one.

5. This is not abuse, what the mother did when she would not take the girls to the dentist even though they had insurance and medicaid, that is abuse.

Page 3 In Home Family Service Agreement

Exchanges between the parents be as amicable as possible. They always had been and I have a years worth of video proving it. When the mother would yell and cuss at us we would walk away, we would not comment or we would say thank you.

DSS was well aware that there was not arguing occurring at the exchanges, because they had seen some of the video's and made inappropriate comments about the parents acting like robots, and not acting human. So which is it DSS?

Also on page 3 note that David is to attend all sessions for counseling that Tammy and David provide for Lydia. Follow the recommendations of the counselor. 3 sessions? That was all they wanted, what good does that do? Plus their own Strengths and Needs state that the child has minumal problems, what child doesn't.

Page 4 In Home Family Services Agreement

The threat of Foster Care....

Under the section of what it will take for the case to close, the only thing listed is that at least 3 counseling sessions be met. Then they closed this case before those sessions were met, saying that the order had come down to close the case, that they did not care if the counseling was completed or not.

Page 6 In Home Family Services Agreement

This is what I thought then and it is still what I think now, with one exception, after the lies that Linda Brooks told I now believe her to be just as guilty as the rest.
That concludes the In Home Family Services Agreement...tell me where is the abuse?
>> 
>> COMPLAINT AGAINST WILKES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SEVICES

This lays out our entire complaint

RISK ASSESSMENT page 1
>> 
>> Read this carefully and look at what they used to keep the case open, this is not child abuse or neglect in anyway shape or form. They mark a one on lines R8 and R9 saying that we weren't complying with the in home services agreement, on this date, there was no in home services agreement. So exactly how were we failing to comply with something that did not exist? If you read the letter from Surry County DSS, it directly contradicts these findings stating that we complied with everything DSS ever told us to do and then it lists the date the in home services agreement was created.
>> 
>> Furthermore, when one was created all it said on it was for my husband to get dental insurance on Lydia and that the pick up and drops off should go smoothly without any arguments.
>> 
>> My husband had dental insurance on Lydia when her mother wouldn't take her to the dentist before and had kept coverage on her for years. We lost the insurance when he lost his job, due to DSS's failure to investigate our report in a timely manner. Because they did not do their job, the civil action we had filed kept being postponed awaiting their findings, my husband had to keep asking for days off to be in court. Then DSS missed the appointment with the psychologist and it had to be postponed, so he had to ask for another day, which resulted in him being let go because he missed too much work. I guess what really gets me is they acted like the mother couldn't take Lydia to the dentist if he didn't have insurance, but she had her on medicaid the entire time.
>> 
>> RISK ASSESSMENT page 1
>> 
>> Look at our score on this risk assessment, it is in the low box, and if you take off the boxes that they marked on the first page because it wasn't true, then our actual score would have been a one. They knew they had nothing on us to substantiate against us for, they knew they had no reason for leaving this case open...so they made something up. Even with the score they gave us, they still had to do an override, because according to their own paper work, if the score is that low they are supposed to not substantiate or keep the case open, so they lied about us not complying with the case plan in order to leave the case open.
>> 
>> RISK ASSESSMENT SECOND page 1

Pay attention to R8 and R9, now it says that we are complying and the only thing we receive a point on is my husband's age...yet they still override this low score by stating that we are not complying with the cft of 9-11-07 there was no In Home Services Agreement on this date. Furthermore they state in this that we are "Succesfully completed all programs recommended or actively participation in programs; pursuing objectives detailed in service agreement."

RISK ASSESSMENT SECOND page 2

Discretionary Override: This is a complete lie, by their own admission on this document.

RISK ASSESSMENT THIRD page 1 and 2

This says the same thing as the previous Risk Assessment, but note that the Discretionary Override is missing. So why did they override it before and not now. They never had a case against us, we never committed any kind of abuse. They did all of this to discredit our valid complaints against them, because in their minds they felt that if they made us into child abusers, no one would listen to our complaints.

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT page 1

Good parenting skills, then why are you bothering us???

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT page 2

Look at the strengths, now look at the needs

Minor child Characteristics...What child doesn't but of course she has minor characteristic's her mother had been married 3 times in four years and was constantly bring men in and out of the children's lives introducing them to the children as this is you "new daddy". Furthermore, the mother was mentally ill. Which I might point out we were not.

Underemployed...Only because my husband lost his job because of them.

Caregiver Neglected as a child...Yes I was abused and neglect, but by their own hand I have good parenting skills. I was abused as a child...I am 38 now. Tell me what this has to do with anything?

Childs needs;

Tutoring: Well she lives with her mother fulltime, that falls on her shoulders although before DSS involvement we had already been going to the school and picking up her school work and making her make up on our every other weekend visits.

Speech problem: Again we had already contacted the school before DSS involvement about Lydia's speech and were told by them that she did not need therapy.

Not seeing Counselor: David and I had been trying to get Lydia to a counselor for years before DSS involvement, the mother would not let her go and it is hard to find someone to take her on the weekend.

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS SECOND ASSESSMENT pages 1 and 2

This says the same thing as the First, it still states that we have good parenting skills, so why are they bothering us?
>> STRENGTHS AND NEEDS THIRD ASSESSMENT pages 1 and 2
This says the same thing as the First, except now I guess the jobs we had were good enough, it still states that we have good parenting skills, so why are they bothering us?
>> 
>> PETITION FILED BY DSS TO GET THE MOTHER TO COMPLY page 1
>> 
>> This is the petition that DSS filed the same day, just mere hours, after I called them and asked them why they had done nothing about Tammy's failure to attend and take Lydia and her sister to the psychologist for the evaluation. They dismissed this petition, because after they filed it she took the girls and herself.
>> 
>> PETITION FILED BY DSS TO GET THE MOTHER TO COMPLY page 2
>> 
>> If you read this page, it basically tells you that we have done what we were supposed to, while the mother had not. She would not even set up times so the SW could check on the girls, yet they dismissed the petition. The other thing I found funny was that they went after her for failing to take the girl's to the mental health evaluation, but would not do anything about her not taking them to the dentist. As a matter of fact, L:ydia's sisters teeth were not fixed until her last appointment with the psychologist, almost a year after they received their report.
>> †
SECOND REPORT NOT ACCEPTED

This is another report that I made because Lydia had bruises on her upper right arm that looked as if someone grabbed her. The psychologist say these bruises too and felt they were suspecious, but did not report them because he was unsure of what caused them. He did state he would be watching Lydia more closely in the future. Look at why they screened this one out....

LETTER FROM DSS ATTORNEY MR. FREEMAN

In my view this is a very intimidating letter sent to try and shut me up. I am asking for more documentation because I feel that their are more forgeries and falsified documents in the file. I believe they do not want me to have them because there are more forgeries and falsified documents in the file. I love how he states that the case is closed. Closed or not it does not excuse their behavior in this case, nor does it end their liability.

JUDGE BYRD'S ORDER DATED NOVEMBER 20, 2006 pages 1 and 2

If you notice in this order Judge Byrd orders DSS to submit a written report of all findings, this was in November of 06. They did not submit their findings to him until May 08, and then it is not even the truth but lies. All Judge Byrd received from them was the psychologist report that was full of BS and this letter that was also full of BS. Just how long do you think you have to comply with a Judges order?
Note the first paragraph on the second page, so does this mean if you break your child's arm and there is no permenant damage that it is not abuse?

SECOND LETTER FROM DSS ATTORNEY MR. FREEMAN

Again with the intimidation.
>> 
>> 
>> ALLISON S. BAKERS CRIMINAL BACKGROUND SEARCH Pages 3 and 4
>> 
>> This is the background check I had done on Allison S. Baker, the original Social Worker, at the Wilkes County Courthouse, May 15, 2007. As you can see Mrs. Baker has been charged with 8 Counts of Forgery, Obtain Control Substance by Fraud/Forgery. These Charges were knocked down to misdemeanor, possession of a controlled substance to which she was sentenced to probation and community service and when she complied with that they did what is known as a 90 96 Review and dismissed the charges. The point remains, someone who has been charged like this should not be working for Social Services where they remove children from the home for substance abuse by the parents.

INITIAL CASE PLAN, DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS

Nikki Hull brought this to our house when she came August 20, 2007. Even she said that this stuff made no sense as DSS is not supposed to involve themselves in custody issues. Nothing on this was ever set up or scheduled by DSS. Now if this is what they are talking about in the Risk Assessments they are responsible for setting this stuff up and they never did. In fact we were told that they decided not to use this.† But I fail to see how this could be what they are talking about, due to the date that they mention on the risk assessments, on those the date is September 11, 2007.

Following is the question just received:

Visitor: Mr. John Claggett

Address: 108 Jaye Lane, Providence, NC 27315

Email: johnclaggett@comcast.net

Subject: Traffic Law Enforcement

Comment: In the spring of 2007 the sheriff of Caswell County requested through the Board of Commissioners that NCDOT conduct a traffic study due to ongoing safety issues on SR 1503 (Walters Mill Rd). NCDOT conducted the study and deemed signage was necessary. The signs were placed and now even after all this time there isn't any enforcement by either the State Hwy Patrol or the local Sheriff's Dept. The State Hwy Patrol says they can't enforce the signs that NCDOT deemed necessary and the local law enforcement says it's a state maintained road and they don't have the manpower. Who can I contact to rectify this convoluted process? I can't get my state representative to return my calls (Bill Faison). Mr. Mike Mills of the NCDOT as well as Sargeant Pearson of the SHP is aware of this particular area in Caswell County.

Subject: Immigration

Comment: NCDMV has informed my husband that they will not renew his 10-YEAR-OLD drivers' license when it expires. The Federal government has not extended Section 245I of the Immigration law - the next step in the process for an immigrant who marries an American citizen. Although we have been married for over six years, THERE IS NO NEXT STEP IN THE PROCESS unless he travels to Costa Rica. And THERE IS NO GUARANTEE that he can return if he goes. In NC, we need to have ALL drivers licensed and insured. How are we safer with un-licensed, uninsured drivers on the road? NJ is considering legislation to change this. It won't make immigrants legal - that's a Federal law problem. But NC needs to know who's driving on our roads! I don't care if a drivers' license is just a photo ID with "UNDOCUMENTED" in bold red letters on it. At least we'd have SOMETHING to identify who's on our roads.

Dear Governor Easley,
This e-mail communication is a follow up to previous letter that was sent regarding the harrassment and rudness of mail correspondence by the Department of Motor Vehicles. I am requesting a response to the 50.00 civil penilty that NC is trying to impose on tax paying citizens for changing auto insurance companies. A formal complaint is attached...

I telephoned Ms. Thomas to inform her that her claim had been
adjudicated yesterday, 1/12, and that she was found eligible for UI
benefits.  A debit card will be mailed to her this morning and should
take a week to ten days.  At present 7 weeks of benefits are on the
debit card.

I also discussed with Ms. Thomas what seemed to be happening when she
visited the Fayetteville Local Office.  She would attempt to file her
weekly certifications by computer at the local office and would receive
a message stating that her claim had been revoked.  Each time she would
question it, staff seemed to treat her "strangely" and twice asked to
see her Social Security card.  I asked her if she had ever had any
problems with identity theft, as this sounded like a message our
computer system would generate if another claim had been filed with the
same SSN.  I cannot imagine why the local office staff did not explain
the problem to her, especially when she could prove she was the true
owner of that SSN.  Ms. Thomas is satisfied with our apology, thrilled
to be receiving her benefits and glad to know what was happening.  I
have forwarded the problem in the Fayetteville local office to the
proper channels for discussion and customer service training as necessary.

Dear Mr. Fox:

Your email to the Governor's office was referred to me for response. I checked with the NCDOT Alexander County maintenance office for the background on Jake Reese Court.

The paving project went on the list for paving priority sometime in 2001, with several projects above it in priority.†Right of Way (R/W) research†began in early 2004 only to have a conflict with an out of state property owner.†This person did not want to sign the proposed R/W agreement, which was required to go through with the paving,†and attempts to contact this person to negotiate an agreement were unsuccessful.†The budget crunch in 2005-06 put a lot of secondary construction programs on hold, adding to the delay.†In the meantime, efforts to negotiate a R/W agreement with the out of state property owner continued to be held up as we went in to 2007†without†a response to†any method of contact.†Finally the remaining property owners agreed to fund the Secondary Roads Condemnation process, and in mid-2008, the NCDOT district office in Statesville†began the initial surveys.†Once completed, the R/W department in Shelby sent a letter to the out of state property owner to†explain the upcoming condemnation procedure, and only then did she contact the NCDOT district engineer that oversees Alexander County.†This person has since signed the†R/W agreement and†it was recorded on Oct. 28, 2008.†Now that all R/W agreements have been signed, we are at the mercy of the current budget situation. Once it†improves and money is available for the project, Jake Reese Court is number one on the list to be graded and paved.†If you need†additional information, please contact NCDOT Alexander County Maintenance Engineer Cole G. Gurley at†(828-632-2164).

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott
NCDOT Communications Officer

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, For more than six years now NC DOT in Alexander County has been saying over and over they are going to pave Jake Reese Court, but every year it never get done. Can you find out what the problem is in getting the only remaining dirt road in Alexander County paved? Why does DOT keep listing it in the local newspaper(Taylorsville Times) as being on the list of roads to be paved, but it never gets done? Thank you for your assistance. Respectfully, Floyd C.

I still believe that the State of North Carolina should review this type of situation.

The†man has been married to an American citizen for over six years.
The man has paid Federal and NC income taxes.
The man could provide dozens of references from NC friends and customers.
The man has had a NC drivers license since 2000.
The man has an immigration attorney.
The man has all immigration approvals that exist at this time.

The only reason that he†does not have complete documentation is because the
US Congress let Section 245I of the Immigration Law expire.

I still believe that we would be safer if ALL the drivers on NC roads were licensed and insured.

Dear Mr. Riley,



Thank you so much for your many years of service to our country.† Thanks also for your interest in employment with state government. Governor Perdue referred your letter to me and asked that I reply.

North Carolina state government is dedicated to serving our stateís citizens by hiring the most qualified candidate for each position. Each state agency and university handles its own recruitment and selection, as the individual agencies are the most capable of determining the candidate who best meets the needs of their programs. Most agencies use the state application (Form PD-107).† Others accept only equivalent on-line applications.† Details and specific contact information are provided with the individual vacancy notices on the job postings web site.

North Carolina State Government, through merit-based recruitment and selection processes, is committed to hiring qualified applicants.† From the information provided on the application, candidates are screened based on criteria specified in the vacancy announcement.† Hiring managers interview and make selection decisions from the most qualified group of applicants.† In appreciation for† your service to this State and this country during a period of war, and in recognition of the time and advantage lost toward the pursuit of a civilian career, as a veteran you are granted preference in employment.

I am sure that your qualifications and years of experience would serve North Carolina well and I urge you to apply for any positions that may be of interest to you. You will find a listing of available state jobs on our website at <http://www.osp.state.nc.us/jobs/>http://www.osp.state.nc.us/jobs/. †Review the vacancy list frequently, as it is updated four times a day.

The state of North Carolina also has a temporary service agency, Temporary Solutions, <http://www.osp.state.nc.us/tempsolu/index.htm>http://www.osp.state.nc.us/tempsolu/index.htm. Temporary positions often lead to permanent employment with the state. You may also wish to visit the website of the Employment Security Commission, <http://www.ncesc.com/>http://www.ncesc.com/, for jobs in the private sector.†

I wish you great success in your pursuit of a career with North Carolina state government and, again, thank you for your service to our country.

Sincerely,

Margaret Jordan

Subject: Employment Opportunities for NC Military Veterans

Comment: Dear Office of the Governor: First of all congratulations to Governor Bev Perdue for your great accomplishment and well organized, run and truthful campaign. You had my support through both your Lt. Governor elections and you additionally had my 110% support and prayers in your run for NC Governor. Well Done!!! On a another note and personal to me, I was born and raised in North Carolina at Cherry Point, NC while my Dad served in the US Marine Corps. I have served in the military 31 years out of my 55 years in this great Nation and State of ours. I am now a Military Retired Veteran who is unemployed after my retirement, went through a divorce and now may further have to suffer losing my home due to foreclosure due to my reduction in my income. I desperately need employment consideration in this case. My preference for a NC employment opportunity is to work with one of our State agencies. I have applied on numerous occasions with little or no avail or consideration for me as a military veteran. I would very much appreciate a member of your Staff to offer me some resolution and hope that our State and National Leaders care and are concerned not only for us as Citizens but for those like me who served our Country so proudly and selflessly in keeping the USA a safer place to live, work and raise our families. I would consider it an honor to be considered for subsequent employment in one of our State Agencies. Madam Governor, State Council and other NC Leaders, I request that you offer assistance in this much needed concern of mine. May God richly Bless you and your tenure as Governor of the Great State of North Carolina. Your time, cooperation and consideration are greatly appreciated. Sincerely, George T.

Deb:



Ms. Paden had filed a complaint with our office prior to contacting the Governorís office and that is why this was not processed as a Governor referral.



Attached is our letter closing this file and a copy of the response letter sent directly to Ms. Paden from Wells Fargo (WF).



According to the response from WF a letter was forwarded to Ms. Paden on 04/06/2008 advising of the delinquency of the mortgage.† Also, proper notice was given on 4 occasions via certified mail to her HOA address and the property address.† Loan is due for 03/01/2008 - 08/01/2008 payments.†



Ms. Paden was informed that in order to review her loan for any workout options she needed to submit financial information for review.† Ms. Paden sent financial information but failed to provide proof of income.† She finally sent proof of income, but the foreclosure had already been completed and her request to rescind the foreclosure was denied.†



Per request of OCOB, the eviction process was delayed over the holiday season.† Ms. Paden plans to try to get proof that you supplied your income verification in a timely manner to WFHM and if she does we will revisit the complaint at that time.† Otherwise, her only option is to accept the Cash for Keys to vacate the property and avoid an eviction.†

I spoke with Mrs. Parker.† The first thing we talked about was her low income level.† I wanted to see if she could be eligible for any assistance with her Medications through the Medicaid program or the Low Income Subsidy (LIS) program.† She verified that she is married and with the combined income of her and her husband, they are over the amount for the above programs and have checked into assistance before.†

I explained to her that the penalty is assessed through the Federal Government office of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and is assessed if you did not sign up for a Part D plan when you were eligible to do so.† She has a Medicare Advantage plan that has a Part D plan with it and is being assessed the penalty on the Part D end.† I explained to her that she will need to enroll into a stand alone Part D plan to disenroll from her current plan unless CMS will allow her to drop the plan back to the inception date. She said that she called Medicare and they are going to drop the plan for her back to the inception date.† I explained to her that since she has monthly drug costs, that she may want to reconsider dropping the plan, even though she has a penalty, to help her with the drug costs.† She understands that she will need to contact Medicare to see if they are going to drop the plan and explain to them that she needs to enroll into a stand alone Part D plan if she wants to have drug coverage.† She has my name to call me back with further questions and also has the number to our SHIIP counseling site in her county where she can receive one-on-one counseling.

Do you know someone who is on Medicare and needs assistance in paying for their prescription drugs? Medicare beneficiaries may be eligible for the federal Extra Help low income subsidy program if he/she has limited income and resources. The Extra Help program can increase cost savings by paying for all or part of the month premiums, annual deductibles, and provide lower prescription co-payments under a Medicare prescription drug plan. To qualify for Extra Help, the annual income must be limited to $15,600 for an individual ($21,000 for a married couple living together). Additionally, the total resources must be limited to $12,510 for an individual ($25,010 for a married couple living together). The resources do not include a primary residence or a vehicle. If you believe someone you know may qualify for the Extra Help program, please encourage them to apply on-line at <http://www.socialsecurity.gov/>www.socialsecurity.gov, or contact our office toll free at 800-443-9354 and we may assist them with completing the on-line application process or send them a paper application.

Ms. Wright:† The Governor's Office has asked the Department of Insurance to respond to your concerns over the pre-existing condition clause.† I have attached a document explaining the pre-existing condition clause which should be helpful to you.† Also, following is a brief summary about HIPPA rights, and the NC Health Insurance† Risk Pool.† Hopefully this information will be helpful to you.

Except for a select group of individuals, known as HIPPA-eligible individuals, individual coverage may be fully underwritten by insurers ñ meaning that insurers may decline to offer coverage based on the individualís health information. However, once an individual is covered, an insurer may not terminate or refuse to renew an individual policy unless it offers to each affected individual the option to purchase any other individual health insurance policy offered by the insurer. This feature is known as ìguaranteed renewability.î Brochures regarding eligibility criteria and guaranteed purchase rights for HIPAA eligible individuals, the list of individual carriers as well as our Consumers Guide to Health Insurance can be found on the Department of Insurance website at <http://www.ncdoi.com/>www.ncdoi.com.



There is also a high-risk pool in the state of North Carolina that would provide coverage to individuals that are unable to obtain health insurance coverage because of pre-existing conditions and/or unaffordable rates.† The North Carolina High Risk Pool can be reached at

I reviewed Mr. Matthew's UI claim to be sure that we had correctly
applied UI law.  The original Adjudicator's decision was that he
admitted staying on the job for 6 years when he conditions were the same
from the date of hire.  UI laws do not allow payment of benefits when an
individuals puts up with adverse conditions for that long and then quits
because of those conditions.  Mr. Matthews appealed that decision and,
during the appeals hearing, two witnesses testified that the manager had
always cursed at Mr. Matthews and most other employees.  This testimony
served to enforce the ruling of the Adjudicator.  The Appeals Referee
affirmed the Adjudicator's decision and then Mr. Matthew's appealed to
the Commission.  The attorney representing the Commission affirmed all
prior decisions.  As of this date, Mr. Matthews as not informed us of
any further appeals and his appeal rights have expired.

I telephoned Mr. Matthews saying that I wanted to see if he had any
questions about the way his UI claim had been handled and about the way
the UI law had been administered.  When I explained that  the ruling
from the Adjudicator was based upon the fact that he waited for six
years to quit, he seemed to see everything in a new light.  I think he
wanted someone to understand that he shouldn't have had to take the
"abuse;" he just took it too long.  Although he still wasn't happy to
not be receiving UI benefits, he was pleased to have been contacted and
was glad to finally understand the process and the decision.
Additionally, I suggested several other state agencies that might be of
help to him.  When he kept wanting some way to tell someone about how
his employer acted, I referred him to the Dept. of Labor to file a
complaint.  Mr. Matthews did tell me that he was approved for Food
Stamps this morning.

Comment: Dear Gov.Pudue: Congratulations to you on your win in the general elections and being sworne in as Governor of our state of North Carolina! My name is Bobby Rauf. I am former 1st Vice Chair of Cleveland County Democratic party and a proud supporter of your bid for the office of Governor for North Carolina. We will continue to root for you and support you in Cleveland County and we wish you best of luck. I would like to bring an important issue to your attention as you assume your duties as our Governor. This issue has to do with implementation of the Beacon Compensation Program being enforced by the current Controller reporting to Governor Easley. Under the program being enforced by the current Controller, Physicians working in our State Hospitals, such as Cherry Hospital, are NOT being compensated fairly for the overtime worked by the physicians. These physicians and the hospital management have already petition and brought the matter to controllerís attention, but in vain. As you take on the governance of our state, your investigation and attention into this matter would be greatly appreciated by state health care providers and the patients who need the care so critically. Thanks, in advance, for your time and attention in this matter. Bobby Rauf (336) 596-3826 129 Camille Drive Shelby, NC 28150

The Honorable Beverly Perdue

Governor for this Great State of North Carolina,



First Governor, allow me to extend my congratulations to a most successful campaign. As you stated on many occasions, while campaigning across this state; ìIt takes all of us to make it work.î



While your tenure has only begun, it is truly refreshing to see you come out in favor of an open and inclusive government as exemplified in the January 14th Raleigh News and Observer article ìThatís an orderî.î Perdue also signed orders to post state grants and contracts on a central Web site. That's another good public access idea, along with town hall meetings, four of them, during her term. And Perdue was consistent in her campaign in vowing to open state records and conduct business in the open, which wasn't always the case with former Gov. Mike Easley.î



It is very frustrating when one knows of a true injustice and canít seem to get anyone to just look at it unbiased. This is especially true, when considering our present economic state of affairs. Fulfilling the need list should always prioritize the wish list of special interest.



Governor Iím attaching some points for study on my concerns; I truly recognize how busy you are but strongly feel this is deserving of considerations and study by your task force. Please donít hesitate to contact me if I can answer any question or be of service in any way.



Respectfully,



Steven F. Shell

I enclose below the response to my enquiry by the NCUC.† †I appreciate that NCUC responded at all in regards to my letter to Governor Easley's office.† I was already aware of Ms. Brownlee's testimony.



This is not a satisfactory response on the part of the Utility Commission.† In the Commission's own Mission Statement, contained on their web page, there are three†relevant mission objectives.† (When a Mission Statement is made, it is assumed that the agency is committed and thus responsible for, achievement of the mission objectives)† These objectives are :

Disavowal of the Commission's responsibility toward the people of North Carolina and the United States in regards to responsible development is an example of government that is out of control.† The Commission's endorsement of the destruction of a crucial state and national treasure of the people of North Carolina †will most certainly 1) seriously impair harmonious customer relations 2) show specific failure to appropriately plan growth by permitting needless destruction (there is plenty of non-historic land available for Duke to work with out here; this specific destruction is carelessness and laziness, not need)† 3)† failed to coordinate appropriate development for the state in regards to historic districts.† Thus, the†Commission openly violates its own directives.† Perhaps the Commission should just post a codicil on†its own webpage that†states that†it makes Mission Statements, but has no responsibility to attempt to fulfill them.



As always, when a bureaucracy is out of control, separate agencies spend their time pointing fingers at†other agencies and no one takes responsibility.††Since these agencies serve the people of North Carolina, why must the people (such as Ms. Brownlee) coordinate activities between the departments?† I was a Federal Civil Servant for 30 years, and the coordination between departments on the approval of similar projects was the responsibility of the government, not the client. It was a major part of my job, and my own gladly accepted responsibility, to "stop the buck" at my desk.† †



The bottom line is that an offense against the history of our state and country is imminent and it is the duty of all the government, particularly the managers, to prevent that offense.† Proper coordination with Duke Energy could easily solve this problem by assisting this utility in locating nearby, non-historic land for this project.†



Please look into this matter and develop a solution that will serve the people of NC now and for years to come--rather the careless self interest of Duke Energy.† I am sure they mean well, but do not obviously understand their duty to the public interest as many who work solely for profit do not.†The people appoint a government to regulate trade, and thus to encourage such people to understand their civic duty .†

Dear Ms. Jordan,



Thank you so much for your timely response from the Governor's office regarding my recent comments and inquiry.† The service to God and my Country was a great honor and pleasure†for me.



I must say that you have a wonderful talent in composing a letter and covering all the fine points of concern.†† Madam Governor Perdue is definitely fortunate to have you and your credentials on her team for the challenges ahead.† During my military career my unit's slogan was "Mission First, Family Always".



Ma'am, would it behoove me to forward a copy of my resume to your office for review and subsequent opportunity consideration at a later date?† I have completed several online state applications and forwarded them to their perspective agency offices.† I hope in time those applications may be reviewed and I receive favorable contacts to schedule an interview(s).†† I know that economic times are difficult all over our great state but, as I endure my current rough patch, I can only hope things will improve soon for all.††† An employment opportunity at this†juncture†of my†life would ensure that I would not have to experience a foreclosure and lose my home that I have resided in during the last 11 years.†† I will continue however, to be proactive in my continuity of a job search and endeavor to persevere with a good positive attitude.



Ms. Jordan, may I echo my words of appreciation, and gratitude again for your timeliness in responding to my recent letter.† I feel confident in my quest and journey to†obtain†employment in the near future.†† Please send my heartfelt gratitude and thanks to Gov.†Perdue for referring my letter to you for appropriate action as you have so†accurately achieved.† Again, my hat is off to the Office of the Governor and her fine Staff for their recent accomplishments and plans to make North Carolina "Clean and Green" again.



Thank you.

> Thank you so much for your many years of service to our country.† Thanks also for your interest in employment with state government. Governor Perdue referred your letter to me and asked that I reply.

> North Carolina state government is dedicated to serving our stateís citizens by hiring the most qualified candidate for each position. Each state agency and university handles its own recruitment and selection, as the individual agencies are the most capable of determining the candidate who best meets the needs of their programs. Most agencies use the state application (Form PD-107).† Others accept only equivalent on-line applications.† Details and specific contact information are provided with the individual vacancy notices on the job postings web site.

> North Carolina State Government, through merit-based recruitment and selection processes, is committed to hiring qualified applicants.† From the information provided on the application, candidates are screened based on criteria specified in the vacancy announcement.† Hiring managers interview and make selection decisions from the most qualified group of applicants.† In appreciation for† your service to this State and this country during a period of war, and in recognition of the time and advantage lost toward the pursuit of a civilian career, as a veteran you are granted preference in employment.

> I am sure that your qualifications and years of experience would serve North Carolina well and I urge you to apply for any positions that may be of interest to you. You will find a listing of available state jobs on our website at <http://www.osp.state.nc.us/jobs/>http://www.osp.state.nc.us/jobs/. †Review the vacancy list frequently, as it is updated four times a day.

> The state of North Carolina also has a temporary service agency, Temporary Solutions, <http://www.osp.state.nc.us/tempsolu/index.htm>http://www.osp.state.nc.us/tempsolu/index.htm. Temporary positions often lead to permanent employment with the state. You may also wish to visit the website of the Employment Security Commission, <http://www.ncesc.com/>http://www.ncesc.com/, for jobs in the private sector.†

> Comment: Dear Office of the Governor: First of all congratulations to Governor Bev Perdue for your great accomplishment and well organized, run and truthful campaign. You had my support through both your Lt. Governor elections and you additionally had my 110% support and prayers in your run for NC Governor. Well Done!!! On a another note and personal to me, I was born and raised in North Carolina at Cherry Point, NC while my Dad served in the US Marine Corps. I have served in the military 31 years out of my 55 years in this great Nation and State of ours. I am now a Military Retired Veteran who is unemployed after my retirement, went through a divorce and now may further have to suffer losing my home due to foreclosure due to my reduction in my income. I desperately need employment consideration in this case. My preference for a NC employment opportunity is to work with one of our State agencies. I have applied on numerous occasions with little or no avail or consideration for me as a military veteran. I would very much appreciate a member of your Staff to offer me some resolution and hope that our State and National Leaders care and are concerned not only for us as Citizens but for those like me who served our Country so proudly and selflessly in keeping the USA a safer place to live, work and raise our families. I would consider it an honor to be considered for subsequent employment in one of our State Agencies. Madam Governor, State Council and other NC Leaders, I request that you offer assistance in this much needed concern of mine. May God richly Bless you and your tenure as Governor of the Great State of North Carolina. Your time, cooperation and consideration are greatly appreciated. Sincerely, George T.

FYI

Regarding Ms. Heffnerís inquiry concerning her daughter, Ms. Gammaro, there is not really anything we can do.† If Ms. Gammaro had contacted us directly, we would have directed her back to her attorney.† But because Ms. Heffner is not a party to Ms. Gammaroís claim, I donít think it would have been appropriate for us to respond directly to her with non-public information about the claim.

Please help. I live in NY state, but my daughter, Andrea Gammaro has lived and worked as a nurse in Morganton, NC for the past 9 years. In March she had her third child and returned to her job as a home health nurse six weeks later. Shortly after returning to work (June) she injured her back, taking care of her patient. The injury was reported and she continued to work, while the injury continued to get worse. At first workman's comp had her try physical therapy, which proved to be of no benefit. She wa s put on light duty and allowed to work 14 hours a week, because this was the number of hours she was working when the accident happened. Her back has contined to get worse, to the point where she can do little or nothing without being in excruciating pain. Finally in October the doctor (selected by workman's comp)decided surgery was necessary to fix her back. Workmans Comp agreed and the date for the surgery was set for Nov 25. On the 21st of Nov she reported to the hospital in Hickory for her pre op appointment and was told she didn't have an appointment that Workman's Comp had changed their mind and there would be no surgery. Now they want her to start over again by seeing a doctor in Mooresville. It makes no sense that she would have to travel that distance when there are excellent doctors in Hickory. My daughter is at the point now where she is unable to take care of her children without help and is about to lose her home due to the loss of income for the last 6 months. My hus band and I have been using our savings to keep them in their home, but we can't continue. All she wants is for her back to get fixed and be able to return to work. She needs someone to step in and make this happen. Her phone number is 828-438-1994. I am hoping that you care enough about the people in your state to help. My sincerest thanks.

I still believe that the State of North Carolina should review this type of situation.

The†man has been married to an American citizen for over six years.
The man has paid Federal and NC income taxes.
The man could provide dozens of references from NC friends and customers.
The man has had a NC drivers license since 2000.
The man has an immigration attorney.
The man has all immigration approvals that exist at this time.

The only reason that he†does not have complete documentation is because the
US Congress let Section 245I of the Immigration Law expire.

I still believe that we would be safer if ALL the drivers on NC roads were licensed and insured.

Following is the question just received:

Visitor: Ms. Robin Smith

Address: 200 Brierridge Drive, Apex, NC 27502

Email: rsmithcpa@msn.com

Subject: Immigration

Comment: NCDMV has informed my husband that they will not renew his 10-YEAR-OLD drivers' license when it expires. The Federal government has not extended Section 245I of the Immigration law - the next step in the process for an immigrant who marries an American citizen. Although we have been married for over six years, THERE IS NO NEXT STEP IN THE PROCESS unless he travels to Costa Rica. And THERE IS NO GUARANTEE that he can return if he goes. In NC, we need to have ALL drivers licensed and insured. How are we safer with un-licensed, uninsured drivers on the road? NJ is considering legislation to change this. It won't make immigrants legal - that's a Federal law problem. But NC needs to know who's driving on our roads! I don't care if a drivers' license is just a photo ID with "UNDOCUMENTED" in bold red letters on it. At least we'd have SOMETHING to identify who's on our roads.

My sister and I own a home in Franklinton. We refinanced it through HSBC last February with cash-out to get money for repairs and taxes. The payment/interest were high due to a past bankruptcy we had but they were the only lender that would refinance us at the time. They promised us that in 6 mos. we could reinance again and lower the interest rate (is 12%now)-when we went back,they didn't want to talk to us about it and still don't. We have been approved twice for FHA loans but HSBC won't let go of the loan. We asked to have the interest lowered or the amount lowered to lower the payments, the lady told us "too bad-you owe the money, pay it". Our house will go into foreclosure in the next few months as we are behind now 45 days. The government program for Hud/Hope Now is not even in place. The housing counselor told us they don't even have a lender to help people with this nor has the bill passed! We don't want to lose our home but we are now looking for a place to rent, with not much luck. When does the government help people like us? We're not bad people. We took care of our elderly parents for 16 yrs. in NYS and my brother sold the house and got all the money, we had to move after 50 yrs. of living in that house. We had to file bankruptcy in Florida after moving there due to our parents medical bills we paid-the rest of the family did nothing to help us and still isn't. We are in our 50's and just want to keep our home-Can someone help?? Thank you, Dona Miller

Subject: Insurance Rates

Comment: Homeowners Insurance Rates to Increase! I have been a homeowner for the last 10 years. Luckily, I did not fall into the mortgage mess and still can afford my monthly payment. However, Insurance rates have kept increasing to outrageous amounts over the past years. Furthermore, North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Jim Long, has yet passed another rate increase for North Carolina Residents. My rate has increase from $350.00 in 1998 to $1400.00 today not including the 30% increase to start in May. This is OUTRAGEOUS. I love owning my own home and understand insurance is a fact of life, but common, if rates keep going up I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD A HOME ANYMORE! Please do something to stop the latest proposed increase to home owners insurance. Thank You.

I still believe that the State of North Carolina should review this type of situation.

The†man has been married to an American citizen for over six years.
The man has paid Federal and NC income taxes.
The man could provide dozens of references from NC friends and customers.
The man has had a NC drivers license since 2000.
The man has an immigration attorney.
The man has all immigration approvals that exist at this time.

The only reason that he†does not have complete documentation is because the
US Congress let Section 245I of the Immigration Law expire.

I still believe that we would be safer if ALL the drivers on NC roads were licensed and insured.

Ms. Smith,
I am sorry but the Division must follow Chapter 20 Laws when issuance is made.† Under General Statutes 20-7(f)(3) and 20-7(s) it explains that any individual requesting issuance must be able to show proof of legal residence or a document showing a legal extention to remain in the States.

Subject: Immigration

Comment: NCDMV has informed my husband that they will not renew his 10-YEAR-OLD drivers' license when it expires. The Federal government has not extended Section 245I of the Immigration law - the next step in the process for an immigrant who marries an American citizen. Although we have been married for over six years, THERE IS NO NEXT STEP IN THE PROCESS unless he travels to Costa Rica. And THERE IS NO GUARANTEE that he can return if he goes. In NC, we need to have ALL drivers licensed and insured. How are we safer with un-licensed, uninsured drivers on the road? NJ is considering legislation to change this. It won't make immigrants legal - that's a Federal law problem. But NC needs to know who's driving on our roads! I don't care if a drivers' license is just a photo ID with "UNDOCUMENTED" in bold red letters on it. At least we'd have SOMETHING to identify who's on our roads.
