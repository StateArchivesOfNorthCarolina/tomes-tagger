I have also worked as a furniture craftsmen for 32 yrs. I work for a place called "Hickory White" (I helped make the new furniture in our state senate,how do you like it?) Furniture has been made at my workplace since 1902. However, for years now our employer has been sending more and more of our work to his plant in Vietnam. At the same time a flood of import furniture is driving us out of our jobs! I know there are plans in motion for job retraining, but how about some job PROTECTION? I am age 50 and it's a bit late in my life to transition into another occupation. Why should we be forced out of our present jobs because a greedy employer wants to exploit cheap labor overseas and doge US.Labor laws and fair pay to American workers? If the working middle class is "The backbone of our economy" Why then do our representatives in our own government aid men like my employer in breaking that backbone? How about a high import tax?

> Comment: Governor: I am Lucille Ferry, CEO/Founder of The Foxglove Foundation, Inc. I founded Foxglove for help to displaced families. In my work in getting my corporation off the ground I have experienced my own displacement. I had my identity stolen from me and it took 2 years of fighting with Texas and Florida to get a new and valid state ID. There is no national database that can help a person when this happens and a person has to have documentation from more than one state in order for them to get their new identity card. One of the things that I want to be able to do at The Foxglove Foundation, Inc. is to put together a database with the help of state leadership that will enable us to work with any family so that when a fire, flood or other disaster happens to a family, their documentation can be gotten in a timely fashion and their identity restored. When I had my identity stolen I contacted Texas because Florida requires a valid birth certificate to replace the lost ID. Texas told me I had to have a valid ID to get a copy of my birth certificate. The wrangling that went on between the states and myself lasted for two years until I rolled (I am in a wheelchair) into the DMV and said I wanted the Florida supervisor to contact Texas and see what besides my paychecks, IRS statements, and residency receipts would they take in order for me to get a birth certificate. It is my goal to help others so that they will not have to go through what I went through. It is even harder when that ID is used for a criminal act. The person whose ID is used to buy or steal things and the bill is sent to the person whose ID was used while the criminal keeps racking up charges against the owner of the ID. I would like to know who in Raleigh would be the person/department that I could work with so that we can create a database that would have information from each state showing what that state required in order for an id or a birth certificate or a death certificate or a wedding license to be gotten. This would be a secured database so that no one could log in to our system and gain access to information that would create a even greater criminal act. Then when a family comes to us we can pull up that database and see what is required, what can be used as an alternate , and what the cost is in getting the required documentation. This will allow us to help the families so they can have access to their bank accounts, cash checks, replace credit cards, or go to buildings or jobs where their ID is required. The following link is to our temporary web site. We are having a .org site built This will give you some more information about who we are and what we will be doing to help families. Since I have started this project 4 years ago 7 more cities, some in Florida and some in other states have requested a project like ours. I have told them that we would be glad to come and establish our displaced family program in their area but I have to get Jacksonville up and running first. I now have a Board of Directors that not only see the vision but embrace it. I want to be the first call that Disaster Services makes when a family needs housing. Our mission states says "When housing counts". This is my passion. This will enable Disaster Services to spend their limited funds helping in other areas. This will enable a family in crisis to have a safe place to stay together while we get their house, their ID or their job rebuilt, repaired, or replaced. Whatever you can do to help us will be most appreciated. Sincerely, L M Ferry CEO/Founder The Foxglove Foundation, Inc. 904-647-9059 foxglove123@comcast.net www.geocities.com/foxgloverich/

Dear Governor Purdue,

We need your help.

Below is a msg to Commissioner †Mark Jones outlining a most severe problem in Jackson County
and the surrounding areas; Lack of high speed Broadband.
Also my response to Ron Masssingale at Balsam-West below that.

Balsam-West has the Fiber in the ground already in several areas, but lacks the funds to hook up small businesses and private homes.
I spoke with Balsam-West,†owner of the Fiber cable, installed from Sylva to Cashiers, NC ., funded by Private monies yesterday.
Ron Massingale Vice President†of Sales & Marketing,† BalsamWest FiberNet, 704-896-3666

He stated that his company simply can not afford to hook up businesses or private homes along the route of

of their fiber cable due to the high costs of doing so and not being able to show a return.

Subject: [Office of Governor Bev Perdue] State of the State Address on Monday






State of=2 0the State Address

Governor Perdue will address the state from the North Carolina House Chamber on Monday evening at 7pm.† She will discuss the challenges facing North Carolina and her plans to move our state forward during these tough times.

You can watch the address live online at http://www.governor.state.nc.us.†


Governor Signs First Bill into Law

On Wednesday, Gov. 0A Bev Perdue signed a bill into law that lays the foundation for her major restructuring in education leadership.† Senate Bill 198 is the first piece of legislation signed into law by Gov. Perdue.† The act modifies the restrictions on service on the State Board of Education by allowing a second North Carolina public schools employee to serve on the State Board.† The new law enables the governor to restructure and streamline North Carolina‚Äôs education leadership and allows Dr. Bill Harrison to serve both as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the State Board of Education.††

‚ÄúThis new leadership structure will bring a clear line of accountability and efficiency for moving North Carolina‚Äôs public schools forward,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúOur schools can be the best in the nation and I believe these changes will lead to students who become an innovative, well-educated, well-trained workforce of tomorrow.‚Äù


Governor announces DOT decision-making reforms

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue announced the new professional decision-making process for the N.C. Department of Transportation as called for in Executive Order No. 2, which she signed on her first day in office.† The new process transforms the approval process and will improve efficiency, openness and make decisions more strategic. Under the reform initiative, NCDOT professionals will determine project priorities based on data and input from local government and planning groups.† The appointed N.C. Board of Transportation will set transportation policy.

‚ÄúThis new professional decision-making for transportation projects aims at taking politics out of the process,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúThe new process will increase accountability and openness and ensure that transportation projects are prioritized appropriately.‚Äù

On Jan. 12, Gov. Perdue issued Executive Order No. 2 as part of her first day of change orders, which required Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to implement a professional approval process for highway construction projects within 60 days.† The order also directed the Board of Transportation to delegate the Secretary authority to award highway construction contracts.


Governor appoints†policy leadership team

This week Governor Perdue announced she is appointing Al Delia as Policy Director and Mike Arnold as Deputy Policy Director.

‚ÄúAl and Mike will form a fantastic team,‚Äù said Governor Perdue. ‚ÄúTheir in-depth knowledge of North Carolina policy will serve as an asset to my office and to our state.‚Äù

Mr. Delia has over 20 years of experience in working effectively with boards and advisory groups and collaborating with diverse sets of workforce, economic development and educational organizations.† Before accepting the position as policy director, Mr. Delia, 48, served as president and CEO of North Carolina‚Äôs Eastern Region Development Commission. In this role he oversaw plans for business recruitment, retention, expansion and creation for a 13-county region. Prior to his work at the Eastern Region Development Commission, Mr. Delia spent†20 years working in economic development for North Carolina‚Äôs University System.

Mr. Arnold, 37, served as policy director in the Office of the Lieutenant Governor since 2005. During this time he worked with members of the NC General Assembly, advocacy groups and organizations, constituents and other federal, state and local stakeholders to help the Lieutenant Governor implement her policy agenda. Mr. Arnold was directly responsible for researching and developing policy initiatives for the Office of the Lieutenant Governor.

Good Morning Governor! I have not had the opportunity to congratulate on your victory so I will do so at this time. I spent eleven years with the NC Department of Social Services as a child welfare Administrator and I met with you on a few issue during your legislative days. I always found you to be willing to listen and learn as much as possible about issues before rendering your judgement. After my state tenure I moved on to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid in Baltimore and in recent years I have been engaged in healthcare consulting. I can no longer do outside consulting because my wife has been diagnosed with liver cancer and is in need of a liver transplant. I need to return to state service so that I can provide care before and after her transplant provided we are able to get the transplant in time. I realize that there is a hiring freeze and you certainly have your hands full with the State&#39;s dire fiscal situation however, if you can help
 in any way my family will be grateful.

Dear Madam Governor and Local Representatives:

I am an Alternate Representative to the Senior Tarheel Legislature, FYI.† I am trying to get to the bottom of a Property Tax Relief rejection under state law ( G.S. 105-277.1) for a 91 year old Senior Citizen who has lived in the town of Graham, North Carolina at the same location since 1940.†
A Ms. Kim Horton is the administrator an per her is rejecting this seniors' appeal based on page 2 of 4 of the G.S. 105-277.1 quote " Adjusted gross income as defined in section 62 of the code", I would appreciate knowing what or how I get to this Section 62.
Her total income comes out to approx $100 less than the cut off .† Her CPA stands by her 1040 as being correct with a $ 1919 Capitol Loss for the year.† I believe she is receiving a refund from both the state and the federal government for lack of excessive income.
Ms Horton has disallowed her relief on the grounds that her loss for the year does not matter.
Please let me know how I can access this Code 62, what the proper channels of a appeal are, and who in the State Government that is knowledgable about this law.
Maybe, as elected officials its time to look at some of the technical aspects of this law an see if they are applicable to 91 year old ladies who was born in a depression and may very well pass on in a depression.† I'm sure if you just look around you in our state you'll find quite a few seniors just trying to hang on to their† dignity and their homes in these trying times.

Governor,

One of the great unheard of costs in the mortgage foreclosure problem is the uncontrolled and unregulated legal fees imposed on homeowners in North Carolina during a foreclosure process. While it may be possible for a homeowner to work at catching up on their regular mortgage payments, they will often get hit with massive legal fees.

In fact, the legal fees charged during a NC foreclosure process don't even truly match up with the NC Attorney's Code of Conduct, which basically states that fees be reasonable and relate to the experience of people doing the work, i.e. if a legal secretary prepares a filing, don't charge full attorney legal fees.

I know from first-hand experience how onerous and unfair these fees can be. I went through a foreclosure on a property i owned in Charlotte. Due to various circumstances beyond my immediate control I fell behind on the payments. I was actually able to come up with all the payments and legal fees due two days before the foreclosure date. I called the mortgage company to tell them I had the funds, when †they told me there was now "another $2000 in fees to pay". obviously I was unable to come up with that additional amount in two days and lost the property.

I called the mortgage company and asked for a breakdown of the fees being charged for the foreclosure - remember I am being billed these. They told me that they could not provide them and i would need to call the attorney;'s office directly and ask them. After numerous attempts to track down exactly who at the Attorney's office I needed to call, I asked them directly for a breakdown of the fees being charged. The response was that was between †them and the mortgage company and I needed to ask the mortgage company.

Hah!

Isn't it amazing that the people being billed for legal fees that may cause them to lose their home are not provided with any details as to what those fees are. Just a total amount that must be paid - or else. If you, as Governor, don't want to require reasanable limits on those fees, ast least it would be fair to require the mortgagors to provide a detailed bill of what they are charging for! Isn't that a reasonable request?

What's really amazing is that the state of North Carolina doesn't care.

South Carolina mandates a maximum amount on the fees that can be charged as part of a foreclosure proceeding. The amount is reasonable.

Why doesn't North Carolina?

If you want to do something to really help North Carolina homeowners suffering through a foreclosure proceeding, you will investigate this.
I look forward to your reply.

Sincerely,
Martin Bartlett.

THE RESPONSE E-MAIL TO CROSS CREEK MALL ATTORNEY/FIRM BELOW:

Mr. Moore:
This e-mail is to confirm receipt of your letter that includes vague, general references to the alleged actions of me at Cross Creek Mall (the "Mall") that included curious omissions of any other peoples‚Äô actions and speech, including the harassment by the security staff and Fayetteville Police Department Officer Herrera. Neither did you include a copy of any documentation that will be subpoenaed:
1. You were not there, so as you know, your "story" is biased and untrue. The actions of the security staff, Officer Herrera, etc...being ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù is a natural response for an attorney representing the accused.

2. I never lie, so your caution "against making untruthful or inaccurate statements" are an attorney's "trick" at twisting the truth to benefit their client who pays you, thus, takes away any objectivity due to monetary and/or civil litigation reasons. The only slander and libel is by your clients, period.
3. The "various unrelated third-parties" that you refer to obviously display your lack of knowledge into what happened and is on-going. Thus, due to lack of knowledge, is not creditable.
4. Do not communicate with me via e-mail, letter, phone, etc...Except for the request of the documentation of the February 4th, 2009 "Mall" incident, not a threatening letter on libel/slander. If not sent to me via the Andersons, then it will be subpoenaed.
This e-mail will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities, and any references of yours on anything being "unrelated" does not dignify a response at this time.
Please abide by these requests as I will save all documentation, phone messages, e-mails, etc....
Thank you,
Gerry Lindgren

Subject:                F.P.D. HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION EVENTS

Dear O.P.S.:
My name is Gerry Lindgren, (574.52.0295; State of NC ID #39146496), and I am writing to report the recent harassment and discrimination events that I have received this past week from some of the F.P.D.  officers and will forward a copy of this letter to my attorney, Governor Perdue, the A.C.L.U. and the U.S. Senate and Congress due to pending civil action against the Los Angeles Police Department, West Hollywood Sheriff Department, Ft. Lauderdale Police Department, the Anchorage Police Department, Dunn, NC Police Department, and associated entities and individuals, public and private and am concerned with retaliation and targeted entrapment from the F.P.D. due to events that I am not at liberty to currently state.
The most atrocious occurring on February 4, 2009 at Cross Creek Mall with Officer Hererra who was insolent, unprofessional, intimidating, and threatening with the African-American security guard of Cross Creek Creek Mall and there were many eyewitnesses.
First, let‚Äôs chronologically, briefly address this past week, notwithstanding the incident in 2007.
1.      On February 3, @ 8:20 p.m. E.S.T., I called 9/11 due to a large African American male threatening me with violence and F.P.D. Officers Black and Armstrong responded. Officer Black was very churlish and discourteous by treating me, the victim, like the aggressor by asking me why I was walking the streets of Fayetteville all day rather than taking the report and apprehending the aggressor who was standing a few yards away. I responded to him that I am unemployed, looking for work, had my resumes, have epilepsy and do not drive and was quite bewildered on why that would be an issue. I described the aggressor as a large black male with a fluffy black jacket. Officer Black was ill-mannered and kept repeating that I need a better description although I kept pointing to the man who was less than 20 yards away. Thus, I called 9/11 again and spoke with the Watch Commander and the 2 responding officers departed without stating anything.
2.      On February 3 @ 12:29 p.m., E.S.T., I was stopped by F.P.D. Officer Chavez on Mcpherson Church Road/Collinwood (after the officer spoke with a male in a black S.U.V.) while seeking employment.
3.      On February 4, 2009 @ 2:14 p.m., E.S.T., I was stopped by Officer Combs on Mcpherson Church Road (near the Olive Garden) while seeking employment.
4.      On February 4 @ 3:30 p.m., E.S.T., I walked from the Olive Garden on Sycamore Dairy Road to Cross Creek Mall. I was only in for a few minutes and upon exiting, a  women intentional knocked into me and I was verbally and physically harassed by the on-lookers referring to me with obscenities. I walked past them to the other entrance to make a report to security. As I entered, I walked by Officer Hererra who initially walked past me saying nothing. I stated that he ‚Äúmust stop having the public harass me‚Äù and he turned around and stopped and searched me. Then, the African-American Security Chief at Cross Creek Mall who has always given me a bad time joined in harassing me and claimed that people claimed that I yelled an obscenity (UNTRUE AND THEY PROVIDED NO EYEWITNESSES TO COLLOBORATE THEIR CLAIM AND NO WRITTEN DOCUMENT AND/OR AFFADAVIT). Then, Officer Hererra asked me to grab my property and go to the security room. As I was doing this, he screamed at me and threatened !
 me, handling his gun. NOTE: I TOLD HIM THAT I HAVE EPILPSY. I ALSO HAVE AIDS AND ARC (AIDS RELATED COMPLICATIONS) THAT INCLUDE DISABLING PERIPHERAL-NEUROPATHY THAT AFFECTS THE HANDS AND FEET EXTREMITIES, AND IN SEVERE CASES LIKE MINE, IT AFFECTS THE ARMS, LEGS AND WALKING IN ADDITION TO SEVERE ARTHRITIS SINCE CHILDHOOD AND DIFFICULTY WITH UNCONTROLLED BOWELL MOVEMENTS DUE TO THESE ILLNESSES AS DESCRIBED BELOW. THESE ARE DOCUMENTED, MOST RECENTLY ON THE 26TH OF JANUARY 2009 WITH DR. CHIMA AT SOUTHER REGIONAL A.H.E.C., AND I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE ANY OF THESE MEDICATIONS EXCEPT FOR EPILEPSY.
5.      On the way to the inside the Cross Creek Mall Security, there were many eyewitnesses, mostly military personnel, who witnessed the harassment of Officer Hererra threatening me to walk faster and ready to assault me. Inside the Security Room, the African-American Security Chief slammed the door on my right shoulder while Officer Hererra was standing right behind me so close that I could feel his breathing on my neck. The African-American security guard banned me for one year after I refused to sign his deceitful and duplicitous document that left the omissions of how everything started with no due process to challenge any of the lies and specifically mentioned that if I went to the Bank of America, that I would be arrested. Subsequently, I called 9/11 again to speak with on of the 2 Watch Commanders, so I was transferred to the Cross Creek one who came on duty @ 3:00 p.m., E.S.T.,  Lieutenant Kelly who incredulously stated to me to ‚Äúgo see a doctor ‚Äú and hung up the ph!
 one on me. I called again and he repeated the same infantile comments. Later, at 5:00 p.m., E.S.T., I called for an apology and he denied speaking to me or even knowing about the Cross Creek Mall incident even though he was the on-duty (although he is unfit for duty) Watch Commander for this specific location. Then, the African-American security chief, numerous other security guards with hands on and near their weapons, along with Officer Hererra, walked me all the way to Skibo Road, even following in vehicles that seemed quite excessive with numerous outside eyewitnesses as I did not disobey, I repeat, I did not disobey any order other than telling them that attempting to force me to sign a document, especially one filled with falsehoods, is illegal and this angered them.
6.      http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/peripheral-neuropathy

‚Ä¢       Peripheral neuropathy, in its most common form, causes pain and numbness in your hands and feet. The pain typically is described as tingling or burning, while the loss of sensation often is compared to the feeling of wearing a thin stocking or glove.
‚Ä¢       Peripheral neuropathy can result from such problems as traumatic injuries, infections, metabolic problems and exposure to toxins. One of the most common causes of the disorder is diabetes.
‚Ä¢       In many cases, peripheral neuropathy symptoms improve with time ‚Äî especially if it's caused by an underlying condition that can be resolved. Medications initially designed to treat other conditions, such as epilepsy and depression, are often used to reduce the painful symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.
Symptoms
Your nervous system is divided into two broad categories. Your central nervous system consists of your brain and spinal cord. All the other nerves in your body are part of your peripheral nervous system, which includes:
ÔÇß       Sensory nerves to receive feelings such as heat, pain or touch
ÔÇß       Motor nerves that control how your muscles move
ÔÇß       Autonomic nerves that control such automatic functions as blood pressure, heart rate, digestion and bladder function
Most commonly, peripheral neuropathy begins in the longest nerves ‚Äî the ones that reach to your toes. Specific symptoms vary, depending on which types of nerves are affected. Signs and symptoms may include:
ÔÇß       Gradual onset of numbness and tingling in your feet or hands, which may spread upwards into your legs and arms
ÔÇß       Burning pain
ÔÇß       Sharp, jabbing or electric-like pain
ÔÇß       Extreme sensitivity to touch, even light touch
ÔÇß       Lack of coordination
ÔÇß       Muscle weakness or paralysis if motor nerves are affected
ÔÇß       Bowel or bladder problems if autonomic nerves are affected

ÔÇß       Causes
ÔÇß       A number of factors can cause neuropathies. These factors include:
ÔÇß       Autoimmune diseases. These include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and Guillain-Barre syndrome.
ÔÇß       Other diseases. Kidney disease, liver disease and an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) also can cause peripheral neuropathy. Patients with HIV/AIDS also are prone to develop peripheral neuropathy.
ÔÇß       Inherited disorders. Examples include Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and amyloid polyneuropathy.
I respectfully request an inquiry into this incident and why anyone who may or may not have complained about me was not mentioned or corrective action to them due to harassing me by calling me ‚Äúfaggot‚Äù and pushing me that initiated the whole incident in addition to the rescinding of the 1-year ban as I will forward this letter to the following businesses at Cross Creek Mall.

Dear Governor Perdue:

Please allow me to introduce myself.  My name is Beth Vandagriff, and I am a wife and a mother of 3 beautiful children.  I recently opened a before and after school child care center in Wendell, NC after discovering a very strong need for high quality care for school aged children.  This is a project my husband and I spent a long time planning and developing.  We are very proud of our accomplishments and of our growing business.

Being a mother myself of a 12 year old boy and another boy who is starting kindergarten in the fall, I understand the need a parent has to be certain their children receive the very best education as well as a superior level of child care before and after school.  I decided to use my knowledge in building my center to develop a plan that would help our states budget problems and help our national crisis of ensuring each child has a safe place to go after school.  I am delighted to inform you that I have done so.

After spending months doing research and speaking to different area schools, I believe I should introduce this plan to Gov. Perdue.  I know with the budget cuts we are facing, our schools are going to suffer slightly.  If I could just have some time to present what my staff and I have developed to provide superior before and after school care at some of our local schools, I feel that our state and our public schools will benefit in many ways.  With the plan we have put together, our company can greatly reduce what the county and state currently spend on the before and after school programs held at the schools. We will be able to donate a substantial amount of money back into the PTA's of our schools.  We would also provide free child care during PTA meetings which we are certain would increase parent involvement in their children's education.  We would be able to accept vouchers for child care assistance, reducing greatly the amount the state spends per
 child for child care assistance for the before and after care programs, and create jobs in a troubled economy. There are countless benefits to our program, too many to list!

I have an outline and a plan that I would love the opportunity to present to you.  All I need is 20 minutes to show you how we can help the students enrolled in our public schools and their families, as well as the budget problems we currently face.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration,

††††††††††††††††††††††† A user with email address of ridge205@yahoo.com submitted the following question.†



††††††††††††††††††††††† What is your policy on the educational system with students with disabilities?† I have found that in our school systems the child with a disability is the one that is left behind or pushed aside as a problem student.† The current system just tries to push these students through just to get them out of the system. Unfortunate as it is for the teachers is that there is no other way for them to handle such a delicate situation.† The current requirements i.e. IEP are not working.



The one thing that I would suggest is that programs for students with attention span and other disabilities that cause them the need to either move or be hands on be created.† There are many jobs in the world that need to be filled yet these highly effienent people are being discouraged by the push for the current curriculum.† Yes they need math, however why can there not be a program that puts math in hands on form i.e. a mechanical class.† For example one of the best classes my son has had was his 9th grade English class.† It was hands on and the teacher was absolutely wonderful at teaching students with Power Point.† Using visual and hands on aids may be the best solution for these young people.† My hope is that with your administration there will be some more encouragable solutions for students like my son.†

To Whom it may concern,

††† I recently wrote an email concerning how Governor Perdue stands on Structured Sentencing.† I have gotten no response back on this matter.† I know when this was enacted, it was a good idea.† Now our prisons are over populated, and some are closing.† With the economy the way it is today, how can we fund the prison system to house all the inmates, when there is no room as it is.† More and more people are being incarcerated, and not many are being released.† The population is up to over 40,000.

††† I am engaged to an inmate.† One of his friends asked him to pawn something because he didn't have his id.†It was stolen..† Whe he was sentenced, he was given the term of seven years and six months to nine years and nine months, because of his prior history.† I'm not saying he shouldn't do the time for what it did because it was against the law.† But I think the time he got is a little harsh.† Seven and a half years to nine years nine months for a twenty dollar pawn ticket is crazy especially when he did not break into the house and did not steal what was pawned.† There are sex offenders and murderers that get less time than that.†

††† Instead of giving everyone that comes to a sentencing hearing the same time as everyone else by what the judges have to go by.† We should go by the individual crime itself, because the longer an inmate is incarcerated, the harder it will be for them to find a job when they are released.††That means they will more than likely turn back to crime, and return to prison.† It's not "they are criminals,†so they will return lets make them do more time",†there are some really good people that do stupid things, yea they should do time but†we shouldn't go to the extreme.

††† We need to change this law, before you know it all of NC will be in the prison system.† Who will pay for the prison budget then.† †Reduce time for good behavior, work time, etc.† Fifteen years of this is enough.



Thank you,

Governor Perdue,

††††††† I have a sister who has made many poor choices in life and is in now serving time in the womenís prison. Her crimes are DUI and shoplifting and procession of drugs, things that hurt her not other people, I know you have to pay for your crimes but we feel as her family we are paying for her crimes also. She has 3 children and 7 brothers and sisters but she had to be alone going through a very hard time. She was transported to the hospital 3 weeks ago from the prison. No one in the family was notified. Her children went for a visit and were told their mother had been taken to the hospital they would not tell them why or where. A week went by and after many telephone calls to the prison and talking to some very rude people they would not give us any information on her condition we finally got a social worker to talk to us. She arranged a visit for her daughter. She went to visit and found her mother had been in ICU for a week and had emergency surgery and a trek inserted in her throat. She nor has anyone else been allowed to visit her since. We have talked to her Dr. and was told she now has a feeding tube. She has been told she has recurring cancer .She has been through all of this without the support of her family .This has been hard on our family. We are a very close family. We have spoken to someone in your office about trying to get a early release due to her health but we need your help in getting this done and as quickly as possible so that we may go and be with our sister and mother. If it is going to take a while to get her released maybe you can help us get visits arranged. We would be so thankful for anything you can do to help. My sisterís name is Teresa Kay Brown and she is at Wake now. Her Doctor is willing to provide what ever information he needs to get the ball rolling on this.

†† I would also like to congratulate you on winning the election. I voted for you and know you will make a great Governor. Please feel free to have your office call me for any additional information you may need. Thanks in advance for any thing you can do.

Fred,

†I have only been in Home Inspections for the last three and a half years, but being 56 and having owned two other successful businesses over the last thirty years and having been a General Contractor / Insurance Broker / ABC TV Regional Media Sales, I have been around the world a bit.† The Home Inspections world in NC is filled with B.S. and thatís not Bachelor of Science.† We are just experiencing the same intimidation that many common Americans are feeling now by the powers that be.† The NC Real Estate Association and the Builders Association are two of the most powerful in our state.† IT is all about MONEY.† The Builderís build it and the Realtors sell it.† There is only one brick wall between them and the Buyer.† The Inspector.† Common since tells us that we are the odd man out.† I donít claim to know much about the political process in NC, but letís use our noggins for a minute.† We are the only Negative in the equation.† North Carolina has been plagued with the Rich wanting to keep whatís theirs, in the family.† The Real Problem here is the same as with our nation.† You may consider this radical and most likely unfeasible but we as home inspectors are not united as professionals.† The Reason the Unions prospered so greatly in the last century was for this very reason.† Now I am a Republican, and I would be the last person to advocate a union, but when power is so great that you canít fight it, you have to take other steps to be properly represented. †You see We have value and the people of NC need us to help properly protect them, (and this is why Licensing was developed) but we as an industry do not see this, otherwise we would just say no.† No?† What do you mean by NO? Well if we, all stopped doing home inspections for two months, we would have every politician, realtor and possibly the Governor at our door steps, asking US, What can we do to resolve this issue?† Then we could get a majority of the Board as Home Inspectors and proceed as we should.† We have let this happen to us by not making enough noise.† Didnít we just go through this thing with the summary page issues a while back?† Look who interceded for us.† If we donít stand together this type of thing is going to pop up over and over again until we canít be excused without someone telling us when.† I think better educated home inspectors would be a good thing, but who is determining it and why.† This down turn in the economy has made people mean.† When people suffer, they want others to experience the same.

 This is the notice that was in the Hendersonville Times News of the
advertising of bids for building the outdoor shooting range at the
Edneyville  Justice Center.  I understand there was 63 contractors that
showed up to place their bid. We have until March 31st to stop this
process . After that, the building will begin. The Edneyville Community
is veheminately  opposed to having an open shooting range in this
crowded , small outside atmosphere. This will be very dangerous so close
to St. Paul's Road and all the houses nearby. Also, this will be very
noisy for miles around. An outside shooting range will definitely lower
real estate values for miles around. The citizens of the Edneyville
Community are hopeful the governor will reclaim the $1.9 million dollars
to use in her 2009 budget. Later on , when economics are better, we are
hopeful more money can be allocated for an inside shooting range.

RE.: Prison Closure Proposals


Dear Governor Bev Perdue,

††††††††Almost 27 years ago I left Germany and arrived here in the United States of America with my most priced possessions packed in to one suitcase†and I have lived in North Carolina ever since.† I am a single mother of two beautiful children, which attend UNC Charlotte and Methodist University.† My life has not been easy and I lost my first born to SIDS almost 28 years ago.†I had to work hard for what I have now and I also had to†struggle to be able to hold on to it.† My husband abandoned us in 2005 after 18 years of marriage without a plausible reason and he made sure to clean out the bank accounts and take all the kids college money as well.††I raised my son and daughter to be law abiding citizens and to study hard to be able to make something out of their lives and to contribute to society by helping others.† I†attended Fayetteville Technical Community College†and by†the end of 2005 I had earned two†associates, one in Paralegal Technology and one†in General Education but since my husband abandoned us and left us penniless I had to take the first job that was available to have some income coming into my household and† I started working for the Department of Correction, McCain Correctional Hospital, as of April 16, 2006.††I first worked as Medical Records Assistant III and I moved up to Office Assistant†IV†within one year.†I work hard everyday and in the 21 months in my new position I have covered my old position for more than 8 months†for various reasons and I have also trained two new employees in this position as well† and without ever getting any†additional compensation.†I believe in teamwork and I am a team player and a hard worker that helps anyone in†need of assistance and to keep†the workflow going to accomplish the departments day-to-day operations and mission of the department.† All in all, I take pride in all the work that I do†because what I do
does not only reflect on the people and†the department I work for but it also reflects on me.††I know I have much†more potential†than to work for the NC DOC but it is not easy to find a good job in North Carolina without having certain connections that others seem to have.†

††††††††Now we are slated to be closed and morale at McCain is very low.† Most workers here are minorities, women, people of different national origin, most are older than forty, and we have many single parents as well.†††The other facts†are that most employees here†only have a High School Diploma and†some do not even have that and the income of DOC employees is the lowest†pay†of all State Departments and most†have to work second jobs to be able to make ends meet. †All of us are devastated†and scared†and there is a great fear that we will not be placed in other state positions and that therefore our†children will suffer.† The fear of being unemployed and of losing our homes and not being able to take care of our children is more than we can bare.† We do not understand why we are being slated to close while monies are being paid to six figure positions on the top of the hill and other monies are being made available for, Goodyear incentives, probation, community college staff and faculty raises, and teacher ABC raises while we will be losing our lively hood.† The†Federal Stimulus†Package†is, and†was, supposed to save†and/or create 105,000 jobs, and not to shift money†around by eliminating†positions to create new ones for†people with degrees.† As†aforementioned, most employees at the NC DOC do not have any degrees beyond high school and therefore will be disadvantaged and not qualified to apply for the newly created positions.††DOC employees are the lowest paid State Employees and the least appreciated ones and we have been overlooked by our†government and the General Assembly for years.† As comparison†take a look at the† Office Assistant†IV pay at†DOC†that never even reaches the median of the pay scale, even for employees that have worked for DOC for more than 20 years, whereas an Office Assistant IV at†the Department of Crime Control and Public Safety makes the†max salary to the last dollar of the maximum range available, even for new employees.†Where is the equity and fairness in that? †To work in a prison is dangerous and stressful and†employees have†to be aware of their surroundings at all times.† As said before, we feel singled out and we feel unappreciated and we feel as the sacrificial lamb,†not due to the budget shortfall but to shift†money around from the jobs we will loose to some other newly created positions for probation and so that other state employees in the educational fields can receive raises.† How can that possibly save any money?† How will State Government attract good employees in the future when the ones it has, and that are faithfully serving, are being tossed to the side when the going gets tough, and are ignored when the going is good?

††††††††We know that you have to make many difficult decisions but†we would like to know what will happen to us, the Department of Correction employees, that will be laid off when you will close McCain Correctional Hospital and all†the other employees of the smaller prisons that are on the Closure Proposal List?††We feel that the Reduction in Force letter that we will receive will be just a piece of paper that is of no value.††We are†wondering why†you are†creating all these new jobs that most people that will be laid off will not be able to obtain because they do not have the education to qualify for these positions?††Could we possibly be trained and be sent to college†by the state to be able to apply and to be able to feed our children and keep our homes or will we end up on the welfare†list and in homeless†shelters?† Most†DOC employees live from paycheck to paycheck and have no savings.† So please think of all the families and†especially†the children you will be affecting with your decisions.† My children would have to drop out of college if I loose my job and therefore all the things you are trying to do for†education will not be of any help to them and I am quite sure that the same would apply to many other children of DOC employees that you are planning to cut.† What is education made available going to do good when you†have no time to be able to get educated because you cannot afford it because†you have no time and have to work two jobs just to get by?† I, for my part, would love to go back to†college to†work toward my bachelors degree but I can not because I do not make enough money†to put my†two children and myself†through college at the same time.††You see, my children are all I have and they come first, for they and their future are my main priority, but when I loose my job I can not even take care of†their future†anymore.† Please think about how you will affect all these children by laying us off, since children and education seem to be your main priority†such should include the children of DOC employees and their future as well. ††

Cordially,

Monika F. Smith

Dear Governor,

Since you have stolen all the rainy day funds to help pay off the three billion dollar debt of our state, what do you propose to do if we have a major hurricane hit this state this year?

In the beginning the state promised the funds from the state lottery would never be used for anything other than the school system.

Now you have taken millions of the school lottery money to be used for other things. Should we as the state citizens call this a promise broken or just another lie told us by our elected politicians?

Dear Governor Beverly Perdue,

I want to protest the proposed state law supported by Tony Rand that would force Buncombe County and Asheville City school districts to consolidate.

What matters most is educating these students as well as possible, and Mr. Rand is proposing this law with the sole concern of saving the state money.  While in these difficult economic times all possible savings need to be investigated, this decision is not in the best interest of students.

A primary reason we live in the Asheville area is because of the good schools.  We use the county system but have friends who use the city system, and currently we are all pleased with our schools.  As currently configured, both systems work, and many school officials are saying that little money would be saved by consolidation because the systems already coordinate with each other.  

A massive decision like this should only be made if it will provide students with a better education.  Our public schools are struggling right now, and we want to see you voting for improvements in education.  Studies have shown that smaller schools districts and smaller schools do a better job educating students than larger districts and larger schools.  In a decision like this, the students must come first.

Education is the most important state issue to me, and I voted for you because your platform stressed providing students with an excellent education.

Sincerely,
Annette Debo

Dear Governor Perdue,



I have concerns that if a male parent of non-monitory had been looking out for the safely, health, and wellbeing †of his unborn child, with a female parent of the minatory that I would not be sending you this e-mail at all.



One would think and say whatís going on here?† Wait a minute and fix this.



These concerns are for you to be able to help make a difference, in the way that North Carolinian are being services by the government. As some times the oneís who live it are the best one who can help make it better. †Where as North Carolina is growing, and that there seem to be no balance of power to accuracy reflect the demographic population. Where those person of Power and make a positive change. Because the person in power are reluctant to change, and have been in power to long to change. How can people interact, and relate if no body can relate to where a person comes from. And how it is where they come from that that has the power and control to actually help and make a difference.



I had the pleasure of reading you position on Dr. Martin Luther King, and president elect Obama. I wish you success as the fist female governor of the stat of North Carolina, and hope that itís time for a change. Iím truly sadden to say that my experiences in North Carolina do not reflect the meaning of hope, in keeping the dream alive. I truly feel that my one and only daughter Jacqueline FranÁoise Davis, my Wife Myriam Davis, and or family, friends and relatives have been the victim of racial profiling, racially based stereo-typing, gender base discrimination, retaliation, and not afforded equal protection under the color of law.† In particular based upon a persons, gender, national original, and affiliations with the state of Virginia. I feel rather my daughter and her family feels that that person acting in concert, under to color of the law, and in official capacity of the State of North Carolina. Have acted without authority, abused there authority, and have just been in humane.

Ms. Hodges and Govern Perdue,



With all due respect my only concerns is that this process with WCHS and GAL needed to be color blind, gender blind, health care blind, nationality blind, and most of all judicially blind by the Honorable Erich Craig Chasse. And the state of North Carolina. In that if you look at the true unreduced records of WCHS, GAL, Wake county attorneys office, most disturbingly all the court orders that it was not and is not colored and reflected in the best interest of my daughter, or any child for that matter. My family is hurt to see how the judicial system, and be controlled and manipulated in such a discriminatory, and prejudicial manner.† That if the state or federal government were to obtain the electronically recording of the hearing in the matter of 07JA705, and files from the GAL office †That there would be clear convincing, cogent evidence of that fact that there needs to be a change to protect families, innocent little children from being abused by the system that was put in place to protect them and strengthen families. Where at to produce productive members of society, not children whoís lives and families have been destroyed. Because a parent voices there concerns of misconduct, material misrepresentation, and how they actually feel.



What was the point in my wife and I receiving treatment and help from the licensed clinicians in the commonwealth of Virginia, if the powers to be refused to acknowledge those services.† And instead pursue what I believe was the intent from the inception, but was just colored to make it look like something that it may have been not. So as to fit into the N.C.G.S. 7b Stature under the color of law. In violation of the N.C.G.S 50(a) congressional guidelines, in conceding a document from the courts by SW Danielle Doyle, and the delaying and obstructing to the process by Wake County Attorney Albert Singer from day one. In the perusing of the mothers non germane, unfounded statements. Which are the crux of the position of everyone now as the true matter of this case. †Where as itís coming to light that this matter has always been about that in the first place. But by statue it took 15 months to work through the legal process in bad faith we feel. †If that were the case I should have just walked away from the mother in 2001, and left her and my unborn child smoking ìCRACKî on the street of New York. If I could have foreseen this coming from the State of North Carolina, from a Judge, from GAL office, From Child support enforcement, from WCHS, and the Wake County Attorneys office. I could have save my mom, my dad, and family allot of pain, grief, sleepless night, mental anguish and suffering.

Ms. Hill

I have been on hold now for more then 3 hours.† This is beyond crazy.† I still haven't got any answers.† I don't have any idea what your processes are and most importantly, I am completely broke.† My bills are still due and I am not getting any answers from you all.† The website is completely vague.†

I have emailed the appeals department and nothing.† Three hours on the phone is absurd.† I am on my cell phone; I don't have a house phone.† If I go over my minutes it is .49 cents per minute.† With a three hour hold this call would have cost me $88, and I have no income coming in my home.† Are you with me now??

I have to hang up now, because I need to contact the gas company and the mortgage company to find out if they will delay my bills, and allow the ESC office to process my appeal and give me a hearing, so that I can get†what is†rightfully due to me, while I am still waiting on my freaking unemployment benefits to start!!!

I need a job, how about you hire me for 3 to 4 hours a day to take calls for you all! That would be more productive then sitting on the phone for 3 to 4 hours†waiting on someone to pick up.† I have to hang up.† I am now at 3 hours and 21 minutes hold time.†

I am on the line now trying to get through and right now, I am at 2 hours and 22 minutes for hold.† This is beyond nerve wrecking and long.† If I had anything to do, I would have set everything aside just to call the unemployment office.† Is that reasonable?† I don't think so.

Ms. Calloway:

The computer records show that on January 23, 2009, you filed a claim for unemployment insurance benefits effective January 18, 2009.††† You and the employer both stated that your last day of work was on January 23, 2009.† Your claim for your waiting period week (the period for which no benefits may be paid) was filed on January 28, 009.† For the first week for which you could be paid benefits, you filed your claim on February 2, 2009.† Based on this information, as of this date (02/09/09) ESC has not taken 2.5 months to review your claim.

Federal law allows a state agency 28 days to review a claim before the first payment is due to be paid.† This period begins as of the date of the claim.† ESC is still within the time period mandated by federal law.

I am forwarding your† letter to the ESC Adjudication Department to allow your concerns to be known by those who will be responsible for adjudicating your claim.† I am also asking that action on your claim be taken as soon as possible.

From: "Dan Nelson" <dannelson7@bellsouth.net>
Date: March 14, 2009 12:23:44 PM EDT
Subject: Guilford Correctional closing





Prisons are an unfortunate but necessary part of our landscape as a
society. 
I will admit upfront, to be one who sees them much more as a beginning
than 
an end.  I have volunteered in the NC prison system since 1992; first at

Sandy Ridge Correctional, then at Guilford Correctional since 1998 when 
Sandy Ridge closed, and in Central Prison with the Kairos ministry since

2000.  As anyone connected with prisons will tell you, the issue between

those who believe in compassion and forgiveness, versus those who want
to 
lock up criminals and throw away the key, is the purpose of prisons, not
how 
they work best.



It's really quite practical.  If inmates, through programs, and personal

interaction with volunteers, can begin to find moral grounding,
recognize 
their self-worth and purpose, and can seek opportunities to obtain and
keep 
a job, some pretty positive outcomes can occur.  First of all, they will

discover that 'citizens' are not the enemy, and some people actually
care 
about them.  Further, they will hunger to reenter society for 'good',
they 
will pay taxes, rather than consuming them, and the rate of recidivism
will 
decline.



For many years, Guilford Correction Institution, under the direction of 
Superintendent James Lacewell, has been a prison where their program 
enriches society, rather than just a place to hide our society's dirty 
secrets.  Numerous work release sponsors support the population,
resulting 
in men who are able to help support their families and/or pay the
financial 
debt of their sentence.  In addition, those on work release pay for
their 
own transportation and for room and board each month.  Finally, assuring

this system, more volunteer hours spent at Guilford Correctional than at
any 
other institution in the state.  It is the type of prison that our other

prisons should be.  Oak Ridge UMC is represented at Yokefellows,
Wednesday 
night services, and with the Community Volunteer program.



In 2001, there was an attempt to close Guilford Correctional; through
the 
efforts of many, it was saved and Alamance Correctional was closed.  In
the 
last 10-15 years, NC has closed ~35-40 prisons, each time further 
compressing the overcrowding.  It has again been proposed that Guilford
be 
closed, this time by the State (not DOC).  From the standpoint of our 
state's attempts at rehabilitation this is a very bad idea, but also,
what 
camp really has room for another 120 inmates?  What about our future as
a 
state?



I ask that you strongly support this institution.  Examine all the facts
and 
see if closing Guilford makes sense at any level.  I realize, like 
landfills, many people like to have prisons out of sight, but criminals
are 
products of the city, and city prisons are an opportunity for churches
and 
other volunteers to improve the quality of life right where they live,
and 
have the resources close at hand to do it.  Clearly the economy is
stressed, 
but don't punish a program that is contributing to the recovery, by
cramming 
its men into a situation where they will be surely be a drain on us,
from 
now until their death.  Thank you for your support of this very
important 
issue for Greensboro and our area.



Sincerely, Dan Nelson

In a year of many budgetary constraints and difficult times within our great state of North Carolina, I wanted to share some good news:† THE NC TEACHER CADET PROGRAM is working!† We are adding classes and expanding our statewide base as we strengthen both the Teacher Cadet teachers and their students.† On the weekend of March 6-7, 2009, more than 650 high school students, who aspire to be teachers, converged at the Raleigh Sheraton Hotel to actively participate in their first ever professional development conference.† This year the focus of the conference was 21st Century Skills and actively engaging students.† All breakouts centered on Bloom‚Äôs Revised Taxonomy and higher order thinking skills.† Bloom‚Äôs was introduced in a joint session at breakfast using a Power Point presentation and a skit with all the characters from the book, HOORAY FOR DIFFENDOOFER DAY!† Every student was able to participate in six active lesson plans utilizing this developmental approach to ‚Äúthinking‚Äù and to take away a booklet outlining ‚ÄúBlooms‚Äù and containing the actual lessons they experienced.

Cadets, like all students, enjoy a little competition.† This year, every TC teacher was gifted with the book HOORAY FOR DIFFENDOOFER DAY and had the opportunity to share it with their students, answer a series of questions (based on Bloom‚Äôs Revised Taxonomy of course!) and design the perfect DIFFENDOOFER School for NC in 2009.† Naturally, the designs and thinking behind them were tremendously creative and the judges spent more than three hours trying to make final decisions about the winners.† Additionally, students were able to make ‚Äúpodcasts‚Äù about what makes a great school.† The links for these podcasts, will be available on our website, www.ncteachercadet.org , later this month, and we invite you to experience the amazingly deep level of understanding our cadets have gained into what is required to be a ‚Äúsuccessful school‚Äù.

The ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù of the conference was the Friday night banquet at which Brian Freeman, an extraordinary teacher from Robeson County and a winner of the NEA Excellence in teaching award, both inspired and wowed the cadets with his talk of ‚Äúaccidentally becoming a teacher‚Äù and all the wonderful events that followed in his life.† He appeared as ‚ÄúGranny‚Äù who had a great deal of ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù to share and soon had the students laughing, dancing, and basically begging for more!† His interactive approach to sharing his story was the very best ‚Äúmodeling‚Äù of good teaching and his humor and innate insights were both challenging and uplifting!† Perhaps more importantly in a year of budgetary constraints, he donated his time because of his great advocacy for public education in NC.† And if that was not enough, Maggie Lowe, a former teacher cadet from Surry County who now attends ASU, shared four original songs she has composed about teachers and teaching.† She had us all laughing and crying about the realities of being a teacher in public education.† She, too, modeled using our talents to engage students in learning and her ‚Äúfearless‚Äù and ‚Äúinsightful‚Äù words touched everyone who was present.

Examples of student comments from the evaluation forms included:
‚Ä¢††† ‚ÄúI will remember this event forever!‚Äù
‚Ä¢††† ‚ÄúThe speakers and breakout sessions were the best‚Ä¶I would change absolutely nothing!‚Äù
‚Ä¢††† ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really know what this was all about and I wouldn‚Äôt have missed it for anything!‚Äù
‚Ä¢††† ‚ÄúThis training was GREAT!‚Äù
‚Ä¢††† ‚ÄúKids at my school told me I should come, but I never had any idea what it would be like.† This was AMAZING!‚Äù

Finally, they say that a picture is worth a thousand words, so you will find a few pictures attached.† Please know that we at the NC Teacher Cadet Program appreciate your support for public education and want you to know that our legislative funding is being spent wisely.† These students are the next generation of North Carolina public school teachers.† Thank you for your investment!

Best regards,

Lina Drinkard
NC Teacher Cadet Director

Dear Governor Perdue:
I have been closely following the state developments regarding mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services over the last three years.† I have done so because of my extensive background in these services and systems reform.† I have noted of late the poor performance of North Carolina as indicated by their grade of "D" by the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and especially the grade of "F" regarding family and consumer involvement in system and policy development.
I am currently serving as the Executive Director of the Mental Health Association in Wilson County, however, the scope of my work has extended far outside our county.† I am offering my assistance in any position deemed to utilize my vast skills and experience set in resolving the issue of the lack of consumer and family involvement in system and policy development.†
Over the last several weeks I have submitted applications for employment with the State of North Carolina for several positions which meet my skill set.† Those positions are as follows:
DMA Service Consultant†††††††††††††††††††††††††††Vacancy Number 60042721††††††††††††††††† Contact:† Shaunielle Randall, 919-855-4120

While these positions are not policy making posistions I know that it takes a team to make the internal changes necessary in the system necessary ours to become a model mental health system.†
Secretary Cansler I have attached a copy of my resume detailing my extensive background, with references, as well as a basic letter of support from Governor James B. Hunt, Jr. (which he will follow up with further comment if needed).
I know your department needs what I and others like me have to offer.† We know the consumer and family voice, and we know how to engage them in this process.† With hundreds of applications received for each of these jobs, as well as other positions which are not even posted, I fear that your human resources staff may miss some of the most applicable candidates to meet the challenges of this time.† I am hopeful that by bringing this information to your attention your human resources staff in all departments will begin to look careful at the applications submitted for the best fit to meet the challenges faced by our current mental health system.
Thank you for your time.† If I can be of any assistance in any way, please never hesitate to contact me.

To whom it may concern:
I would like to bring directly to your attention a problem I am having with some officers of the China Grove/ Landis
†††† Police department. Let this serve as my† complaint officially; but not to be misconstrued and/ or misused to cause any other injustice against me.†† I have already contacted your office in the past, in addition to others in regards to what I believe is in direct violation of the US Constitutional Laws.
If you did some research and checked your files along side of other offices of the law you will find that over the past four year period; approximately I have had to deal with all kinds of harassment from various offices such as Rowan county and Cabarrus county Sheriff‚Äôs officers, in addition to Kannapolis police and the above mentioned. You see Sirs/ Ladies, I stood up for my rights, and most often because I did speak up the harassing behaviors continued and in some instances got worse.† I somehow finally managed to get some of it stopped, but it took a great deal of difficulty. I had to contact: several Senator‚Äôs offices, the Mayor, the Governor, heads of departments, US Department of Justice, and two DA‚Äôs offices in the course of events. During which, they managed to have me barred from 5 different places, including, but not limited to my very own high school tract††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††† (which they locked permanently several years ago) and the parking lot, but also the Field Crest Cannon Stadium parking lot, just to name two.† I cannot prove this but they conspired against me and made false allegations to do so, I would have filed charges against the people involved that very night I am speaking of now, however; the five sheriff‚Äôs officers in addition to a china grove and a landis police car, refused to release the names of the people who brought the false allegations against me in the first place. Lucky for me that on that night I had phoned my family, otherwise I do not know what they might have done to me. I will point out this was Rowan county Sheriff‚Äôs officers at that time, and if they were not guilty, then why would they refuse me the names? I will not get into all of the particulars, but I do have records of many letters I‚Äôve written to try and put a stop to it all such as the one I wrote to the Rowan county school board, Which -by-the-way- contacted the very same sheriff‚Äôs office I had dealt with. They very arrogantly instructed them to put up NO TRESPASSING signs all over the property. I took pictures of it but it didn‚Äôt do me any good.
†††† According to the Constitution, any ordinance or law which in in direct violation to the US Constitution is null and void, Moreover; I have 2 physical diseases and was under a doctor‚Äôs care to get exercise, in addition to having a serious condition that effects the brain, Manic Depression/ BI-Polar disorder, which has been made much more severe due to all I have been put through over the past nine years. Believe you, you really don‚Äôt want to know, and if you did you would just shake your head in disbelief.†† I had taken to walking in the cemetery at night just so I would be left in peace, but the China Grove police found their way there as well, and tried to make me have to park far away where I didn‚Äôt feel safe, plus they spent an half hour or more at my car, and because of all they had already done collectively, I just left the car there, and called my father to deal with it/ them.†
†††† Now today it has started again with an officer in china grove, I do not remember as I also suffer some memory problems now more than originally, but can tell you that during the morning hours I found a new place that had been put there for a housing development, but due to circumstances unknown to me, they were never built. It was located off hwy. 152 on the right side as you are just about to enter china grove. He came in there and informed me that the road was private, and that I had to park my car outside. Now as it stands I have had my life threatened 4 times within these areas. I never even bother anyone, and have abided the law as a taxpayers son and a US citizen, but also as a person with a disability. According to Constitutional law there were 3 court cases mentioned that were won against

such things, and it is also any citizens right to be happy, but also to feel safe and secure in their persons effects property etc..† Can you please help me to see to it that I will be left alone from now on at the very least, and if necessary a court order granted for me to carry a concealed weapon if that is the only way a citizen can be safe, as opposed to being troubled everywhere I go and threatened?†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††† I dropped out of college because they faculty at Rowan Cabarrus Community College couldn‚Äôt respect the laws that were put into place to protect my rights as a person with a disability. They cheated me out of grades that I actually earned, and got away with murder. I couldn‚Äôt afford the attorney, so they won.† How can people who are supposed to uphold the law be allowed to break it every single day by troubling people who are already sick, and innocent, instead of going after real criminals?† Do I have to change my face and identity too, just to have the peace to take a walk? Walking on a street or in a parking lot paid for by taxpayer dollars is supposed to be a citizen‚Äôs right under US Constitutional Law, just like self-defense, traveling, education, etc..† I am summarizing a lot and intend to send this wherever I have to send it to try and get back some peace of mind and some of my God given rights. I will ask you again, Please help me, if it takes firing half of all the departments of law officers, and posting me a bodyguard. People should not be treated as second class citizens or like common criminals when they are not, and for the record; ‚Äúmore laws do not make less criminals‚Äù, and I quote this from the citizens rule book they used to hand out for jury duty in Wilmington, NC. ..
Thank you for your time and further considerations.
With sincerity: Roger A. Connell.

Governor Perdue, below is a proposal I made to Chancellor Thorp at UNC and President Bowles.†† I believe that by working together, with both the UNC System and NC Community Colleges, with this program will help people in our state be better able to get jobs.††† I realize that programs like this cost money but in the long run this program would pay back far more than it cost.

Subject: Proposal for UNC Facilities and meeting future staff needs



Chancellor Thorp



Along with the need to continue helping employees improve skills in basic literacy, computer literacy and other workplace skills, UNC also needs to look for opportunities to serve the larger population of North Carolina citizens.



Presently, UNC Facilities Services maintains more than 16 million square feet of facilities. The vast majority of these buildings use pneumatic technology to control heating, cooling and ventilation. The HVAC and control staff who maintain this equipment are skilled and knowledgeable at maintaining this older equipment, but are still learning to maintain the digital equipment installed in new facilities. The challenge of maintaining the mechanical systems while trying to master the new digital systems is a significant institutional challenge. The controls staff is also aging out of the system, and Building Services is not attracting new staff that can maintain both old (pneumatic) and new (digital) control technologies.



Wake Technical Institute offers an Associate of Arts degree in Air Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Technology. This two-year degree includes coursework in digital controls as well as hydronic heating (steam) and chiller systems.



We propose that UNC establish a cooperative program with Wake Technical Institute as a means of attracting skilled staff to Building Services and Energy Services and supporting the state economy by providing a rich, learning environment for new workers. Not only can UNC provide the cooperative students with the opportunity to meet their degree requirements, but we will also provide graduates with employment and further training that will allow them to meet the requirements for licensing. This cooperative program would also create an opportunity for UNC's skilled staff to stay active and engaged after they retire by teaching and/or mentoring younger workers. And by increasing our digital controls staffing, we may also improve our opportunities to save energy.



In addition UNC and other campuses should explore cooperative programs with Community Colleges in other trades to provide their students with access to on-the-job experience by working with University employees to meet the work requirements of the different degree programs and work experience to meet licensing requirements.

Dear Honorable Governor Perdue

††††††††††† I appreciate the difficult task you face with the North Carolina budget this year but I want to bring a serious public safety issue to your attention that has gone unaddressed too long.† There are over 400 fire departments in North Carolina that protect NC State owned properties.† These properties range from the General Assembly building to the campus of UNC to a Highway Patrol station in the mountains.† There is a fund called the State Fire Protection fund that totals about $5,453,000 that is set aside each year to ìreimburseî those fire departments for the cost of the services rendered.† The problem for years now has been that the fund is over Ω what it should be for equitable reimbursement.† I have attached information to help demonstrate that need.† The budget office of the previous administration twice promised to correct this inequity that places an unfair burden on the taxpayers of the jurisdiction where particular State facilities are placed and they twice failed to do so.



Rep. Verla Insko has (once again) introduced legislation to correct this inequity (H-355) and increase the fund which would address this public safety need.† The people of North Carolina have a significant investment in the facilities of this State and the need to provide adequate fire protection to protect that investment becomes even more acute during financially tight times.† If you canít afford to protect it, will you be able to afford to replace it?† Local fire departments are financially strapped in these times as well and the State should have an obligation to pay fair share for adequate fire protection.† For 187 of these fire departments, it is not an insignificant portion of their annual budgets (see distribution lists attached).† These dollars are also important to the economy of our State as well because local fire departments put the dollars back into the stateís economic flow through salaries paid, supplies purchased, diesel fuel purchased, equipment repaired and purchased and utilities paid.



Governor, I ask that you support the amendment to add dollars to the State Fire Fund and address the public safety needs of fire departments protecting the lives of NC State employees and NC owned facilities.† In the scope of the State budget this is not large dollars but these are critical dollars that have been missing for way too long and the economic crunch on local fire departments has made it much worse.† I and many other Fire Chiefs across our state are willing to work with your budget staff to help address this problem.† Please let us know how you can assist us or we can assist you with this issue.



Respectfully,



Dan Jones †

Subject: Unfair Insurance Rates

I request you support fair insurance rates throughout the state of North Carolina insted of focusing on the coastal counties to raise rates so the more populated areas can get reduced rates as they contain more votes.

I have lived at Kure Beach throught three hurricanes with no damage yet Raleigh, has experienced significant damage as well as Tarboro area.† During hurricane Hugo the coast had little or no damage and Charlotte had extensive damage.† Yet Raleigh and Charlotte will get lower rates paid for by the coastal area.† I have no problem with ocean front properties having to pay due to their location but not those blocks off the ocean front.†

This is a test of fairness versus political pay backs.† I hope you will stand up for fairness.

Sincerely,

Eric and Mary Vann

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing to you with hopes that you may be able to lead me in a direction that may help me recover my money for a service that was not provided to me†by a North Carolina Company.

On September 7, 2008 a company by the name of Directory Innovations came to my church in Suffolk, Virginia to take pictures for a pictorial directory. When I didn't receive my photos ordered when promised, I called and faxed the company many times. I got a response that they would be delivered in time for me to send them in my Christmas cards. They were not. I called and faxed again from which I was again promised they would be delivered. I did get a delivery after Christmas and the order was incorrect. I called and faxed again upon which I was told that if I returned what was sent they would refund my money because of my dissatisfaction and desire for a refund. I sent the pictures back but to this date have not received a refund of $230.80. In fact, now there is no way to get in touch with the company as they have closed. What steps can I take to retrieve my money? The company was located at 124 Unionville Indian Trial Rd. Suite B5 Indian Trail, NC 28079
Thank you for your help with this matter.
