Visitor: Mr. Dwayne Keith Mobley

Address: 110 Warrenton Village Drive, Warrenton , NC 27589

Email: dwaynemobley@yahoo.com

Subject: Natural Resources-Water and payment of the poor

Comment: This letter will bnot appear the same when it is fax to you, it will be a single page! Dwayne Keith Mobley- 203/110 North Warrenton Village Drive Apts. Warrenton N.C. 27589 Home/Fax # 252-257-0520 Thursday, February 19, 2009 Absolutely No E-mails! 2/19/2009 1:35:33 PM To the: Governor Bev Perdue Office of the Governor 20301 Mail Service Center Letter of Complaint: Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 from a poor man! Phone: (919)733-4240 Fax: (919)733-2120 I may submit to you online, but I cannot communicate back and forth, so absolutely no E-mails. Greeting to you, the Honorable and first Woman Governor, of the State of North Carolina, the Honorable: Governor Bev Perdue, I am writing to you today letting you know of many things as I have just done, via fax to your office 2/17/2009 2:17:46 PM. I sent to you letters of the things of which I have endured in the state of North Carolina and the State of New York: the United States of America. But please let me show concern for we here of the County of Warrenton or that of the Granville Counties. That already we are getting an understanding that another drought may be on the way. And we of these counties already pay a very huffy price for the water we use. Major construction has undergone and we the citizens of these counties have been stuck with the bill. There was a time when my water bill read of $25. , but even before this major construction was in play, that even changed. My water bill went from, $25.00 to 43.00 and from that to $47.00 and from this to $76. 00 At where it is now standing at $79. This was all for the amount of 3000, gallons, but as to my understanding this has shortened to 2000, gallons of water and sadly I am not all that sure if this is the complete amount of water set to the standard limit before the price increases or if that is for sewage and also drinking, separately. But on: 1/26/2009 3:15:02 PM I have sent my concerns, via fax to the: NC Utilities Commission - Public Staff 4326 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-4326 Phone: (919) 733-5610 Fax: (919) 715-6704, Public Staff - Consumer Services Division 4326 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-4326 Telephone: (919) 733-9277 Facsimile: (919) 733-4744 With this letter, in which, Mr. Carl Goldstein, at 919-733-9682 gave me someone else to make contact with and the other has not responded, On 12/9/2008 12:40:30 PM, this letter of complaint was faxed to this particular office below: NC Division of Water Resources, DENR - 1611 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-1611 Phone: (919)733-4064 â€“ Fax: (919)733-3558 Water Resource Engineer 919-715-5453 Greetings to you at the North Carolina: Division of Water Resources, my name is Mr. Dwayne Keith Mobley and today I would like to try again to make this complaint to your office, as my first letter of complaint was forwarded to The North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources. I have made letters of complaint concerning the prices of water that we citizens of the county of Warrenton, pay monthly. I have been a resident, where I reside in the county of Warrenton, for over seven years and since then I have seen the price of my Water, skyrocket. When I first moved into my apartment, the price of what I used, was no more than; $24, from there it went to $44, and than $46, and change to $74, and change, to where I has been at &79, and change. NCDENR, 1601 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699-1601 919-733-4984 Fax 919-715-3060 When I first made this complaint someone from my county, phoned me concerning the problem, as if you told them to do so, and I feel that you did not and so, how did they know as I spoke with a Mr. Perkenson of the Warrenton County Water Department. But I was told that our county has a new system of how our sewage is taken from the county and that new system has a greater challenge of taking the sewage away from us, as this challenge consist of our sewage traveling up-hill and the power needed to do this has the forced the county to spend money on the necessary equipment and this cost has been pasted on to the consumer. I feel that after the severe drought we had, that forced the usage of water in North Carolina, to its limits and after this act of nature subsided, that relief in paying for water would not have remained so expensive, but it has and there seems very little we can do about this. So what are we going to do if the act of nature arises again? And sadly nothing ever came for me in response to this and so I felt that being I may have failed to make this a responsive complaint with the State of North Carolina, that you should made very much aware of the prices we the people must pay in order to use regular drinking water, here in the State of North Carolina. As these are prices we pay, after all the restrictions placed on some, concerning water usage and added prices for over-usage. I will not call, but a written response from you would greatly be appreciative, as I make this statement also stating that there are no exceptions to this comment, that it must be in writing. I feel that someone did in fact response to my concerning my first letter of complaint, as I did not get it, as this is due to the theft and fraud of my U.S. Mail. What are we people of the poor, as I am, going to do if we suffer with another drought and water prices must continue to rise? Do we then turn to the Department of Social Services, for help financially as well, provide payment for water also. The Governorâ€™s office, made restrictions on the prices of gas, but what of that with water? This must be look at as price gauging, even after I was told that our sewage system is a new one and is under great stress to take our sewage uphill, away from the area to its final destination and that alone cost, just to pump that sewage away from us to a more better area of which can handle the waste, but is that my fault that engineers were not able to find better ways of disposing of the countyâ€™s waste. When I first moved where I still live, as is at the top of my letter, we did not even have a Sewage price or was there any mention of sewage on the bill itself at all, but since certain county unpublicized take-over, as I state this concerning the Granville countyâ€™s, much have been added on to we the people. No exceptions, you must provide me with a letter of response! If I am unable to fax to you this letter today; Monday, I will do so the next business day!

Subject: Questions about how you are restructuring state government

Comment: I read Governor Perdue's comments in Stateline.org from the Pew Center and I'm curious about any restructuring efforts you are pursuing. I work in the Governor's Office here in Michigan and am working with a group that is looking at restructuring our current 18 departments down to 8. I'd be curious to swap best practices or ideas with anyone charged with doing the same work there. My sister is a resident of Asheville, N.C. and has said some very kind things about Governor Perdue. In addition to the e-mail address provided, I can be reached directly at (517) 335-0344. I look forward to hearing from someone soon. Thank-you!

Greetings Gov. Bev Perdue:

My name is Evette Calloway.  I am a resident of NC and have had to experience some things this past year that has been ungodly and grossly negligent.  I have no idea what you can do or if you can offer some advice.  I am contacting you requesting a change, with corporate america; one in particular, Lash Group AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group.  I have a complaint about a company that possess god awful ethic practices that has abused the unemployment laws that have been put into place.  These laws have been put into place to protect the unemployed that have unfortunately fallen on bad times.  The United States have so many hard challenges to face, and Lash Group's behavior has been highly questionable.  I was fired by the President, Tracy Foster, on 01/23/09, out of retaliatory behavior, due to me asking them to check into racial discrimination compliant.   When they refused to acknowledge my complaint, I filed a charge with EEOC.  After EEOC advised that they were going to start the investigation process, from the charge filed 04/2008, I was fired, on falsified allegation, which lead to me being penalized for eight weeks. 

After I was fired, they argued my unemployment, which caused me to be penalized for eight weeks.  I am currently challenging this decision with the unemployment office.  This leaves me with essentially no income for almost two months, which puts me in jeopardy of getting behind on my fixed and affordable mortgage.  My unemployment is enough to cover my mortgage and household expenses, until I find another job.  How many people can actually say that?  I shouldn't be one of the rising statistic numbers.  I have a masters degree in Healthcare Management; I worked three years for this company, and performed quite well.  Now, because the president has decided to take out this vendetta against me, I stand to lose everything, I have worked so hard for.  Why?  How are they able to do this? 

The reason why I must speak out to you, the Dept of Labor, and through the appeals process with the ESC dept, is because it is about right and wrong.  This is about wasting resources and trying to destroy one individual, by abusing government process to cause hurt to a person.  Our parent company is AmerisourceBergen, Inc, which is a billion dollar pharmaceutical distribution company, and they have time to chase me down and literally try to destroy me.  Just because they are worth millions of dollars, doesn't give them the right to abuse their power, in a struggling economy.  If they can do this too me, then they can easily do this to another person. 

EEOC is dealing with the racial discrimination charge, therefore I am not asking you to intervene.  I am not asking you your advice on this matter.  I fully believe in the capabilities of the federal government, with this matter.  However, the local labor laws and practices are my concerns locally.  I have attached most of the appeal to the unemployment office.  As you can see, I was a good employee and I performed my job quite well. 

What can I do about this?

Best Regards,


Evette Calloway, MBA/HCM

Good afternoon Ms. Tarver,

The Division has received a request from the Office of the Governor to respond to your email listed below.

Review of our records show that a 2000 TOYT, vin #4T1BG22K3YU670298, with plate #YPC9978 is registered in your name. I also observed your file as showing a Notice of Termination, received by Agent Alliance Insurance Company, displaying policy #ACI2126392001500, as being terminated on 12/31/2008. I contacted Agent Alliance Insurance and was advised that your policy did indeed cancel on 12/31/2008 and currently has no insurance being maintained on the aforementioned vehicle. The Division sent a form FS 5/7 informing you of this termination to the address provided by you at the time of registration on this vehicle. On 02/13/2009, we received the unopened returned mail as "UNDELIVERED".   

Ms. Tarver, you mentioned in your email that you did a change of address with the US Postal Service and requested your insurance company to inform the Division of address change. Unfortunately, the procedures used is not acceptable with the Division. According to G.S. 20-67 of the Motor Vehicle Laws of North Carolina, "a person whose address changes from the address stated on the certificate of title or registration card must notify the Division of the change within 60 days after change occurs". If you have not changed your address with the Division, you may do so by sending a written request to:

                                                    NCDMV
                                                    Mail Distribution
                                                    3148 Mail Service Center
                                                    Raleigh, NC 27699-3148

Since no insurance is being maintained on this vehicle, it is required by law (G.S. 20-309) for you to turn in plate #YPC9978 for 30 days. Upon relicensing your vehicle on the 31st day at your local NC License Plate Agency, it will be necessary to provide proof of current insurance, $50.00 restoration and $50 service fees, and appropriate license plate cost. If you feel the findings presented are in error, please do not hestitate to contact me with proof of current insurance?

Dear Ms Perdue.

Please take few minutes to read this attached letter.  I have worked with Guilford County for more than twenty years and just read what happened to me.

I have lot more information about the waste and misuse of Government money and time.
I am an American Citizen and lived in North Carolina more than thirty years.  My husband repaired as professor from NC AT&T University after thirty two years of services.  My stepson, graduate of Chapel Hill is a PhD and working with Federal Institute of Languages'.
Our daughter also a Chapel Hill graduate as MD and in second year of her residency with one of the Harvard Hospitals in Boston.

Reason I am telling all this is to make a point that we are hard working honest tax payer family. We all have worked hard to achieve what we did.

Result I was mentally tortured and unjustified terminated.  No one in Guilford County cares.
I am writing this in lot of hope that as we are going through a tuff time as a nation, there are people having fun on Goverments' money and time, pushing hardworking people like me out of job.  It is about time someone should look into it.

Thanks for your time.

Dear Governor,

I have spent the last 34 years working in the public sector and now I find myself unable to work, and had to take a medical retirement from my job as a Police Detective with the Mount Airy Police Department that I spent 22 years devoting myself to the citizens of Mount Airy. I applied for Social Security Disability and have been turned down two times. I am waiting for a hearing before a judge, but during the mean time I am without any insurance. I draw a check for 1500.00 a month, and they want 1100.00 month for insurance. Now I don't know how to pay for the insurance, pay the power bill and buy food, along with putting gas in my vehicle to go to the doctor, oh, did I mention that I have to have my doctor write my prescriptions using the Wal Mart 4.00 List.  I see other people talking about they received disability and I can't get it. I guess my skin color is not the right color.

Now for the reason for my writing, I have read that you plan to increase the education budget, I have a serious problem with that. First, it galls me to see all the illegal's getting use of the money. They are taking away from our American children, they are costing the school system more money because they have to employ more teachers to teach them to speak English. Then they qualify for free lunches. Secondly, can't you see that raising the taxes on cigarettes will only put more people out of work. This is not helping the economy. This "sin tax" should be attached to the "ho's" that are having babies for money. Tax them to have these children out of wedlock, that the taxpayers have to raise. I raised my two children on my own, they should have to raise theirs on their own also. I am getting tired of my tax dollars keeping of these low life's. I get mad when I see these illegal's driving new cars, bragging about getting free money for housing, health care. When I have to pay for my health care. With all my heath problems, I really get upset at them. That they are using my money, when I could use my money to pay for my heath care, but my taxes are going up to pay for illegal's.

How about trimming the fat with these programs first, then trim the fat in your own office. We the taxpayers of this state are sick and tired of hearing about more money being poured into programs for the illegal's.

Help us legal citizens get the help we need, after all we are the ones that have to pay for it!!!!!

Oh, by the way, find out why it takes someone up to two years to get a hearing for disability. I have already been waiting a year, I don't know if I can wait another year without loosing my house and everything else that I worked hard for.

Good Morning Governor,

I woke up this morning to a very disturbing news item on WBTV. They stated that the NCDOT Secretary of Transportation, Gene Conti plans to not start I-485 in Charlotte this year as you stated many weeks ago.

Is this true?

Can this "MUMPO" group override a commitment made by you?

We truly need the completion of I-485 on the north side of Mecklenburg county to open up more opportunity for jobs to be created and to make them more accessible.

Can you speak with Mr. Conti and redirect his efforts to start construction on I-485 in 2009 and finish so you can "cut the opening ribbon before you leave office" as you stated.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Andy Sutorius

Good Morning,
My son is 4 years old and has cerebal palsy. He is currently in the CAP C program and was set to transition into the MRDD program in January. However now due to "budget constraints" that has been put on hold indefinitely.My son is a twin and he and his sister were born at 25 weeks. I am a nurse and my husband a police officer for 14 years with the city of Asheville. We have a home and struggle but pay our bills and our mortgage! If our son is unable to transition into the MRDD program as planned our house of cards will crumble. When Adam was placed in the CAP C program, that allowed me to return to work as a nurse and more importantly end our need for SSI/Disability that Adam was previously receiving. My husbands insurance provided by the city of Asheville does not provide for Adams required PT/OT and the only way we are able to continue those services is via the CAP program. Western Highlands is our contact (Jesse Smathers) and we are being told they have no idea when the slots will be available for transition. Heath Shuler was instrumental in the 6 month fight to get into the CAP C program and we are grateful for his intervention. We are now being told this is a state budget issue and therefore my email to you. As a parent and a citizen that pays their bills, works hard and is just trying to hold it all together while caring for a special needs child, I would appreciate any information your office could provide as to the CAP program and what we might expect. Thank you for your time!

Visitor: Mr. Eric Britt

Address: 837 Cable Creek Rd., Asheboro, NC 27205

Email: steve@pct.cc

Subject: Cry for help

Comment: Hello, my name is Eric Steven Britt. I am a 35yr. old disabled veteran who is currently at the mercy of the collections department of NCSEAA. I was attending ECPI School of Technology in Greensboro NC when I was involved in a motorcycle accident which took both my legs off right below the knees. Needless to say I was in the hospital at Baptist for over a month and also was very emotionally distraught to say the least. I didn’t return to school and ECPI wasn’t very cooperative when it came to trying to reach a settlement, it was all (all being payment for school as if I graduated) or nothing. Also, I wasn’t the one dealing with the school it was my mother because I was in no shape for it. I understand that there is a debt to be settled but, I being naïve, thought that under the circumstances (lose of legs and not completing school) and me being a Gulf War Veteran, who volunteered for his country, it would count for something. I was wrong. I receive a mere $942.00 a month for disability for me, my wife and 5yr. old daughter, to whom receives half of what I get which just covers her daycare, to live on. Yes my wife works but, just think about, if you are married, you and your spouse’s income together and you will realize that me and my family struggle. Well, now I don’t get my full amount of my check because your department started taking out $152.00 a month about 8 months ago. Not to mention your department also confiscated mine and my wife’s stimulus checks because we filed together and that made it both our debts. I didn’t even know my wife when I was attending this school! I have my GI Bill money left and called to see if it could be used to repay loan but, of course that’s not an option. I just want to be heard! So please, if you can find the kindness in your hearts please, please let me live. While I have this debt I cannot. I also know it is my fault for not dealing with this sooner and writing this letter before now. My life has been a very dark place since the accident and I am just now getting over my depression and enjoying my wife and daughter but, now it is very hard because of the financial burden I lay upon my family. We receive no other assistance because we make too much money. Can you believe that? I owe $5,000 for my prosthetics because Medicare doesn’t cover it all. What did I serve my country for and pay taxes if not to have the security of being taken care of in case of tragedy. If I don’t qualify for full coverage who does? But, that’s not your problem; have to write someone else on that. I recently started a new job so I could provide more financial security to my family and so that I would have insurance to take care of the things that have been neglected. Yes, I am going to loose my disability and probably never be able to get it again, seeing how I was disapproved 3 times initially and had to get a lawyer to be approved! I lost both of my legs, remember. The company I work for installs fiber optics, copper for computers and phone systems and also provide aerial and underground applications. We do work for UNCW, NC School of the Arts, Cities of Salisbury, Lexington, Winston Salem Police Dept., Counties of Randolph, Lee, Rowan and NCDOT just to name a few. A lot of our work is done for our state and government. Ironic. Now, NCSEAA is contacting my employer, Performance Cabling, and wanting my information. No doubt so they can garnish more wages. I can’t understand why instead of me hurting the economy, unemployment rate, being supported by taxpayers and the government’s dollars, I get a job, which in turn is producing all these benefits. No.1 Saving gov. and tax dollars around $16,000 a year. No.2 Putting money back into the economy No.3 Helping the unemployment rate No.4 Not being one of these worthless, lazy human beings, who probably doesn’t even need disability, which uses the Gov. and abuses our system. Now, taking these things, the fact that I volunteered for my armed forces and did four years of honorable duty during Desert Storm, the continuing service I still provide to our government keeping them on the cutting edge of technology and all the things I have mentioned , you would think that would constitute applaud. I hope that someone will find it in their hearts to say that my family and I have paid enough. I know that I owe and I’m not trying to make excuses, I’m just BEGGING for leniency. I would like for someone other than a collection accountant to review this and get back with me. Thank you so much for your time and I hope I haven’t come off as a butthole because I really am not. Just a little frustrated I suppose. God Bless, Eric Britt

Subject: use of gas chambers in county animal shelters

Comment: I received an e-mail and looked on the internet and was sickened and appalled to find out that my home state (my grandfather Ben E Douglas was mayor of Charlotte) allowed the barbaric, sadistic use of gas chambers to euthanize unwanted pets. Who could possibly justify this procedure? Would they take their children and grandchildren to see this horrific act that they are responsible for? And are they proud enough of this decision to tell their friends and neighbors what they authorized? Whoever made this decision or voted for this procedure should have to be present when it's done to witness what they are doing to this animal- in their face. What kind of person could do this? the kind of sick sadistic people who kill and rape children. THIS MUST BE STOPPED PERIOD. Create a law to have all pets neutered/spayed unless they are professional breeders who pay very large amounts for liscence to do so. If you're not stopping this you are a killer.

Subject: NC Needs Smoke-free

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: As your constituent, I urge you to support House Bill 2/Senate Bill 205, legislation that will make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. Please keep the bill strong in its proposed form without amendments. Exposure to secondhand smoke is a health hazard that causes or makes worse a wide range of adverse health effects, including heart attacks, cancer, and asthma. I believe that all workers should be protected from secondhand smoke in the workplace. My support for a smoke-free environment is not in the minority. North Carolinians are voicing their support for smoke-free policies. According to an Elon University poll in 2006, 86 percent of North Carolinians agree or strongly agree that employees in North Carolina should be able to work in a smoke-free environment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that as little as 30 minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. No one should have to risk their life to keep a job. Non-smokers routinely exposed to secondhand smoke have a 50% increase in risk of developing lung cancer. By helping to prohibit smoking in public places and worksites, you will play an important role in ensuring an immediate and dramatic impact on the health of everyone living and visiting our Tarheel state. In addition to saving lives, smoke-free policies save health care costs. A recent study in Pueblo, Colorado found the rate of heart attacks declined 41% after a smoke-free law went into effect. Not only did fewer people have heart attacks, but this had a rippling effect on public and private health care costs. We can't afford to wait any longer to breathe smoke-free indoor air. I urge you to vote yes for HB 2 and keep this legislation strong in its proposed form without amendments. Sincerely, Michael Hansen 3583 Boulder Ct Wake Forest, NC 27587-5946 (919) 528-1231

This is great but it would be greater if there was a forum on how NC taxpayers can get their refunds that are due to them in a timely fashion!   Wonder how the White House would feel about all the delays in getting $$ back into the economy?
Thank you for the update.

Governor Announces Members of Budget Reform and Accountability Commission

Gov. Perdue this week announced the initial membership of her Budget Reform and Accountability Commission. The members will serve with co-chairs Norris Tolson and Hilda Pinnix-Ragland to help Perdue locate and eliminate wasteful expenditures while increasing efficiency in government.

â€œThe leaders I have chosen have expertise in the public and private sectors. This group can help me root out inefficient spending and outdated programs and bring greater accountability to state government,â€ said Perdue. â€œI look forward to working closely with the BRAC team to make sure our taxpayersâ€™ dollars are being used wisely and efficiently.â€

The commissionâ€™s first task will be to conduct a detailed review of the stateâ€™s entire continuation budget to identify inefficiencies and develop options for cuts and consolidations.

The commission members include:

Co-chair Norris Tolson â€“ Retired executive with E.I. Dupont; former Secretary of the North Carolina Departments of Revenue, Transportation and Commerce; and the current president and CEO of the North Carolina Biotechnology Center.

Co-chair Hilda Pinnix-Ragland â€“ Vice-president of corporate public affairs with Progress Energy and chair of the State Board of Community Colleges.

Norma Houston â€“ Lecturer in public law and government at the UNC-CH School of Government; former chief of staff and general counsel to State Senate President Pro Tempore Marc Basnight; and former assistant attorney general in the N.C. Department of Justice.

Dan Gerlach â€“ Former senior budget advisor to Governor Mike Easley and the current president of the North Carolina Golden LEAF Foundation.

Curtis Clark â€“ Former executive director of the North Carolina Statewide Performance Audit (GPAC); former deputy state controller for information resource management; former director of the Performance Audit Division of the North Carolina State Auditorâ€™s Office; and the current Global Director for Regional and Local Government with IBM;

Charlie Sanders â€“ Chair of the National Institute of Health and retired CEO & chair of Glaxo, Inc.

Ron Penny â€“ Former director of the North Carolina Office of State Personnel and current professor and chair of the Department of Public Administration at North Carolina Central University and assistant to the university provost.


$56 Million for National Guard Facility

Gov. Bev Perdue announced Wednesday that work will begin shortly on a $56 million new North Carolina National Guard Joint Force Headquarters facility that will also house offices of the state Division of Emergency Management, the State Highway Patrol and the Department of Transportation in Raleigh.  The project, which is expected to create up to 4,200 jobs, will be open to bids next week with work to start as soon as early summer and to be finished within two years.

In addition to the National Guard, the facility will provide the main offices for North Carolinaâ€™s Emergency Management division, communications for the state Department of Transportation and the triangle area communications center of the Highway Patrol.  About $41.5 million in federal funding for the facility was included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  The remaining money comes from state general and highway trust funds that had previously been set aside for the project.

â€œThis project is big a win for North Carolina.  It provides a state of the art facility that will better coordinate key state services and is ready to put people to work in much needed jobs,â€ Gov. Perdue said.

Securing money for this project was a top priority for Gov. Perdue, who personally discussed it with President Barack Obama and with North Carolinaâ€™s congressional delegation.  Fourth Congressional District Rep. David Price was instrumental in boosting the funding for the Army National Guard account in the federal recovery legislation. 

The new 237,000 square-foot facility will be located on an 18-acre site off of District Drive in Raleigh.  The existing facility will continue to be used by current National Guard offices now housed in temporary trailers.  Since September 2001, units of the N.C. National Guard have been continuously mobilized throughout the world.

The transition of the National Guard from a strategic reserve to an operational reserve requires more facilities to meet the increased service demands.  Also, bringing agencies that consistently work together under one roof, will streamline coordination and provide for more effective emergency response.

First Recovery Contracts Awarded

Work will begin in April on the stateâ€™s first nine highway and bridge projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The contracts total $36.3 million and were awarded this week by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidders, as required by state law.

â€œThese first road projects will create a wide range of jobs throughout North Carolina and can address some of our most pressing, ready-to-go infrastructure needs,â€ Perdue said.

The projects are located in Brunswick, Camden, Currituck, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Scotland and Stanly counties. Two projects, one located in Alamance County and one in Forsyth/Stokes counties, were let to contract on March 17 and will be awarded once the respective low bidders demonstrate that they have met â€œgood faith effortâ€ requirements in attempting to reach the disadvantaged business enterprise goals set forth in the contracts. The disadvantaged business enterprise goals were met or exceeded on the nine contracts awarded.

The bids received on all 11 economic recovery projects let to contract in March came in more than 19 percent, or nearly $15.8 million, below NCDOT estimates. Work on all contracts can start as soon as April 27, with the exception of the Currituck County bridge replacement project, which will begin after June 30th. 

According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation trickles down into the economy six times.

In addition to helping create jobs, the nine projects awarded will complete needed infrastructure improvements. They include four widening projects that will help improve mobility and reduce congestion; three construction projects that will extend key corridors and provide regional access; and two bridge replacement projects, one of which will replace the stateâ€™s fourth oldest bridge still in use.

 Speaking of Health Care, why don't you let the tax payers know exactly how much of their tax dollars are going to the Prenatal Clinics. Most people have NO idea the amount of money that goes to this. It needs to be reworked. Most of the taxpayers don't know how many illegal aliens that they pay for. There needs to be limits on the number of pregnancies that can got through the prenatal clinic.Why should we pay for baby number 5 or 6 of some young black girl with 5 or 6 different fathers??? This program encourages young girls to get pregnant. Their prenatal care is paid in full, their delivery is paid in full, they automatically get on welfare and food stamps. Probably help with housing. Get rid of the prenatal clinics. Stop encouraging them. Let the taxpayers decide if they want their tax dollars going to this program. You know what the result would be. NO! NO! NO!
On another note, I still find it implorable that YOU want to take away the longivity pay of state employees. This is backwards. If you work hard and do right, your bonus is taken away. If you do nothing get pregnant , we will pay for everything. This is just not  right. Get God back in our government and it will get better.

Dear Governor Perdue,
     Thank you for all you do to help the good folks of North Carolina.  I wish you the very best.
Please protect the economic opportunities that our State is counting on to bring us out of the recession.
One of the bright spots in our agricultural economy is the growing of grapes and the resulting wine sales.
Would you reconsider the 5% sales tax increase on wine.   This tax will drive down our thriving wine industries chances of success.  Thanks, David Fussell

Visitor: Mr. John Slayton

Address: 4735 Lancaster Park Drive, Winston Salem, NC 27103

Email: sbslayton@hotmail.com

Subject: Taxes

Comment: Dear Madam, We are very disappointed to learn of your plan to raise cigarette taxes. Surely you are aware of the effect on our economy, that you are putting 50,000 jobs at risk when we already have an unemployment rate of 9.7%, not to mention the millions of dollars in taxes that RJ Reynolds pays. With all the ranting and raving about the dangers of cigarette smoking, we have a hard time understanding why cigarettes are not made illegal. Could it be because the loss of the massive amount of money for the government from the excessive taxes? We believe that North Carolina citizens who choose to use the legal product should not be taxed more than any other citizen purchasing any other legal product. We think that cigarettes should either be made illegal, or that smokers should stop being relentlessly targeted as citizens who should pay higher taxes. Please reconsider. Answers to our questions would be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, John and Sandy Slayton

I'm wondering if we are allowed to sent comments to Governor Perdue and her staff via this medium.  If so, my message is that I don't believe her stand against furloughs makes much sense.  Many other states have done it, everyone knows we are in an economic crisis and you cannot call a spade a duck.  We ARE in an economic crisis.  Given the conditions, I find it difficult to swallow that furloughs for State employess is what will keep businesses from locating in North Carolina.  Keeping people employed will provide an assured revenue stream to the State and will make it much easier to recover from this mess we are in.  If people have to go out and look for jobs that are not there, then conditions can only get worse.

Hopefully her budet reform accountability commission members have the savvy required to provide Governor Perdue the information she needs to get us through this crisis, but it seems to me that her current position is not unlike the Democrats in the U.S. Congress who are fighting Obama's leadership to deal with the nation issues. 

It was easy to discover that Governor Perdue and UNC President Erskine Bowles had a little confrontation about her plans.  Is it necessary to remind Govenor Perdue that Bowles managed to balance a national budget?  My own opinion is that he has better knowledge about how to handle economic issues than she does, and I hope she pays attention to his advice.  More importantly, please don't try to balance the budget on the backs of the (little) people who make this state strong.

Thank you.

Governor Announces Members of Budget Reform and Accountability Commission

Gov. Perdue this week announced the initial membership of her Budget Reform and Accountability Commission. The members will serve with co-chairs Norris Tolson and Hilda Pinnix-Ragland to help Perdue locate and eliminate wasteful expenditures while increasing efficiency in government.

“The leaders I have chosen have expertise in the public and private sectors. This group can help me root out inefficient spending and outdated programs and bring greater accountability to state government,” said Perdue. “I look forward to working closely with the BRAC team to make sure our taxpayers’ dollars are being used wisely and efficiently.”

The commission’s first task will be to conduct a detailed review of the state’s entire continuation budget to identify inefficiencies and develop options for cuts and consolidations.

The commission members include:

Co-chair Norris Tolson – Retired executive with E.I. Dupont; former Secretary of the North Carolina Departments of Revenue, Transportation and Commerce; and the current president and CEO of the North Carolina Biotechnology Center.

Co-chair Hilda Pinnix-Ragland – Vice-president of corporate public affairs with Progress Energy and chair of the State Board of Community Colleges.

Norma Houston – Lecturer in public law and government at the UNC-CH School of Government; former chief of staff and general counsel to State Senate President Pro Tempore Marc Basnight; and former assistant attorney general in the N.C. Department of Justice.

Dan Gerlach – Former senior budget advisor to Governor Mike Easley and the current president of the North Carolina Golden LEAF Foundation.

Curtis Clark – Former executive director of the North Carolina Statewide Performance Audit (GPAC); former deputy state controller for information resource management; former director of the Performance Audit Division of the North Carolina State Auditor’s Office; and the current Global Director for Regional and Local Government with IBM;

Charlie Sanders – Chair of the National Institute of Health and retired CEO & chair of Glaxo, Inc.

Ron Penny – Former director of the North Carolina Office of State Personnel and current professor and chair of the Department of Public Administration at North Carolina Central University and assistant to the university provost.


$56 Million for National Guard Facility

Gov. Bev Perdue announced Wednesday that work will begin shortly on a $56 million new North Carolina National Guard Joint Force Headquarters facility that will also house offices of the state Division of Emergency Management, the State Highway Patrol and the Department of Transportation in Raleigh.  The project, which is expected to create up to 4,200 jobs, will be open to bids next week with work to start as soon as early summer and to be finished within two years.

In addition to the National Guard, the facility will provide the main offices for North Carolina’s Emergency Management division, communications for the state Department of Transportation and the triangle area communications center of the Highway Patrol.  About $41.5 million in federal funding for the facility was included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  The remaining money comes from state general and highway trust funds that had previously been set aside for the project.

“This project is big a win for North Carolina.  It provides a state of the art facility that will better coordinate key state services and is ready to put people to work in much needed jobs,” Gov. Perdue said.

Securing money for this project was a top priority for Gov. Perdue, who personally discussed it with President Barack Obama and with North Carolina’s congressional delegation.  Fourth Congressional District Rep. David Price was instrumental in boosting the funding for the Army National Guard account in the federal recovery legislation. 

The new 237,000 square-foot facility will be located on an 18-acre site off of District Drive in Raleigh.  The existing facility will continue to be used by current National Guard offices now housed in temporary trailers.  Since September 2001, units of the N.C. National Guard have been continuously mobilized throughout the world.

The transition of the National Guard from a strategic reserve to an operational reserve requires more facilities to meet the increased service demands.  Also, bringing agencies that consistently work together under one roof, will streamline coordination and provide for more effective emergency response.

First Recovery Contracts Awarded

Work will begin in April on the state’s first nine highway and bridge projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The contracts total $36.3 million and were awarded this week by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidders, as required by state law.

“These first road projects will create a wide range of jobs throughout North Carolina and can address some of our most pressing, ready-to-go infrastructure needs,” Perdue said.

The projects are located in Brunswick, Camden, Currituck, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Scotland and Stanly counties. Two projects, one located in Alamance County and one in Forsyth/Stokes counties, were let to contract on March 17 and will be awarded once the respective low bidders demonstrate that they have met “good faith effort” requirements in attempting to reach the disadvantaged business enterprise goals set forth in the contracts. The disadvantaged business enterprise goals were met or exceeded on the nine contracts awarded.

The bids received on all 11 economic recovery projects let to contract in March came in more than 19 percent, or nearly $15.8 million, below NCDOT estimates. Work on all contracts can start as soon as April 27, with the exception of the Currituck County bridge replacement project, which will begin after June 30th. 

According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation trickles down into the economy six times.

In addition to helping create jobs, the nine projects awarded will complete needed infrastructure improvements. They include four widening projects that will help improve mobility and reduce congestion; three construction projects that will extend key corridors and provide regional access; and two bridge replacement projects, one of which will replace the state’s fourth oldest bridge still in use.

Subject: Liquor sales on the Lord's Day

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue; Please reconsider your recent decision to sell drug alcohol on the Lord's Day. Such a decision is to invite the Wrath of God upon us at a time when we should be calling upon Him for Grace and Mercy. Instead of encouraging men and women to endanger themselves and others by this drug use, you would do well to discourage it. Why not limit the sale of this drug to 7 a.m. - 9 a.m. Monday - Wednesday only? God bless you to do the right thing.

One thing I forgot to mention is Merit Pay.  We get annual reviews that are not used for raises.  I think that people who do a good job and don't abuse there vacation and sick time should get a good raise. This can be done with Merit Pay.  There should not be across the board raises.

Subject: NC Needs Smoke-free

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: As your constituent, I urge you to support House Bill 2/Senate Bill 205, legislation that will make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. Please keep the bill strong in its proposed form without amendments. Exposure to secondhand smoke is a health hazard that causes or makes worse a wide range of adverse health effects, including heart attacks, cancer, and asthma. I believe that all workers should be protected from secondhand smoke in the workplace. My support for a smoke-free environment is not in the minority. North Carolinians are voicing their support for smoke-free policies. According to an Elon University poll in 2006, 86 percent of North Carolinians agree or strongly agree that employees in North Carolina should be able to work in a smoke-free environment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that as little as 30 minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. No one should have to risk their life to keep a job. Non-smokers routinely exposed to secondhand smoke have a 50% increase in risk of developing lung cancer. By helping to prohibit smoking in public places and worksites, you will play an important role in ensuring an immediate and dramatic impact on the health of everyone living and visiting our Tarheel state. In addition to saving lives, smoke-free policies save health care costs. A recent study in Pueblo, Colorado found the rate of heart attacks declined 41% after a smoke-free law went into effect. Not only did fewer people have heart attacks, but this had a rippling effect on public and private health care costs. We can't afford to wait any longer to breathe smoke-free indoor air. I urge you to vote yes for HB 2 and keep this legislation strong in its proposed form without amendments. Sincerely, Gail Kays PO Box 322 Rocky Point, NC 28457-0322 (910) 675-2736

Governor Bev Perdue to lead White House Forum on Health Care Reform

Gov. Bev Perdue will lead one of five White House Regional Forums on Health Care Reform this Tuesday morning at NC A&T University in Greensboro.  Elected officials, doctors, patients, private industry, businesses and the public are all expected to participate.  The attendees will discuss reducing health care costs and expanding coverage.

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/events/regionalHealthForum.aspx>You will be able to watch the forum on our website by clicking here on Tuesday at 10:30am.


Governor Announces Members of Budget Reform and Accountability Commission

Gov. Perdue this week announced the initial membership of her Budget Reform and Accountability Commission. The members will serve with co-chairs Norris Tolson and Hilda Pinnix-Ragland to help Perdue locate and eliminate wasteful expenditures while increasing efficiency in government.

â€œThe leaders I have chosen have expertise in the public and private sectors. This group can help me root out inefficient spending and outdated programs and bring greater accountability to state government,â€ said Perdue. â€œI look forward to working closely with the BRAC team to make sure our taxpayersâ€™ dollars are being used wisely and efficiently.â€

The commissionâ€™s first task will be to conduct a detailed review of the stateâ€™s entire continuation budget to identify inefficiencies and develop options for cuts and consolidations.

The commission members include:

Co-chair Norris Tolson â€“ Retired executive with E.I. Dupont; former Secretary of the North Carolina Departments of Revenue, Transportation and Commerce; and the current president and CEO of the North Carolina Biotechnology Center.

Co-chair Hilda Pinnix-Ragland â€“ Vice-president of corporate public affairs with Progress Energy and chair of the State Board of Community Colleges.

Norma Houston â€“ Lecturer in public law and government at the UNC-CH School of Government; former chief of staff and general counsel to State Senate President Pro Tempore Marc Basnight; and former assistant attorney general in the N.C. Department of Justice.

Dan Gerlach â€“ Former senior budget advisor to Governor Mike Easley and the current president of the North Carolina Golden LEAF Foundation.

Curtis Clark â€“ Former executive director of the North Carolina Statewide Performance Audit (GPAC); former deputy state controller for information resource management; former director of the Performance Audit Division of the North Carolina State Auditorâ€™s Office; and the current Global Director for Regional and Local Government with IBM;

Charlie Sanders â€“ Chair of the National Institute of Health and retired CEO & chair of Glaxo, Inc.

Ron Penny â€“ Former director of the North Carolina Office of State Personnel and current professor and chair of the Department of Public Administration at North Carolina Central University and assistant to the university provost.


$56 Million for National Guard Facility

Gov. Bev Perdue announced Wednesday that work will begin shortly on a $56 million new North Carolina National Guard Joint Force Headquarters facility that will also house offices of the state Division of Emergency Management, the State Highway Patrol and the Department of Transportation in Raleigh.  The project, which is expected to create up to 4,200 jobs, will be open to bids next week with work to start as soon as early summer and to be finished within two years.

In addition to the National Guard, the facility will provide the main offices for North Carolinaâ€™s Emergency Management division, communications for the state Department of Transportation and the triangle area communications center of the Highway Patrol.  About $41.5 million in federal funding for the facility was included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  The remaining money comes from state general and highway trust funds that had previously been set aside for the project.

â€œThis project is big a win for North Carolina.  It provides a state of the art facility that will better coordinate key state services and is ready to put people to work in much needed jobs,â€ Gov. Perdue said.

Securing money for this project was a top priority for Gov. Perdue, who personally discussed it with President Barack Obama and with North Carolinaâ€™s congressional delegation.  Fourth Congressional District Rep. David Price was instrumental in boosting the funding for the Army National Guard account in the federal recovery legislation. 

The new 237,000 square-foot facility will be located on an 18-acre site off of District Drive in Raleigh.  The existing facility will continue to be used by current National Guard offices now housed in temporary trailers.  Since September 2001, units of the N.C. National Guard have been continuously mobilized throughout the world.

The transition of the National Guard from a strategic reserve to an operational reserve requires more facilities to meet the increased service demands.  Also, bringing agencies that consistently work together under one roof, will streamline coordination and provide for more effective emergency response.

First Recovery Contracts Awarded

Work will begin in April on the stateâ€™s first nine highway and bridge projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The contracts total $36.3 million and were awarded this week by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidders, as required by state law.

â€œThese first road projects will create a wide range of jobs throughout North Carolina and can address some of our most pressing, ready-to-go infrastructure needs,â€ Perdue said.

The projects are located in Brunswick, Camden, Currituck, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Scotland and Stanly counties. Two projects, one located in Alamance County and one in Forsyth/Stokes counties, were let to contract on March 17 and will be awarded once the respective low bidders demonstrate that they have met â€œgood faith effortâ€ requirements in attempting to reach the disadvantaged business enterprise goals set forth in the contracts. The disadvantaged business enterprise goals were met or exceeded on the nine contracts awarded.

The bids received on all 11 economic recovery projects let to contract in March came in more than 19 percent, or nearly $15.8 million, below NCDOT estimates. Work on all contracts can start as soon as April 27, with the exception of the Currituck County bridge replacement project, which will begin after June 30th. 

According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation trickles down into the economy six times.

In addition to helping create jobs, the nine projects awarded will complete needed infrastructure improvements. They include four widening projects that will help improve mobility and reduce congestion; three construction projects that will extend key corridors and provide regional access; and two bridge replacement projects, one of which will replace the stateâ€™s fourth oldest bridge still in use.

For more information about recovery funding for infrastructure improvements in North Carolina, as well as other NCDOT projects and activities, visit <http://www.ncdot.gov/>www.ncdot.gov.

Subject: cutting longetivity pay for teachers

Comment: I would like for Gov. Perdue to know that I am against cutting longetivity pay for teachers. We work hard in the classroom in preparing our students for the future, as well as taking home work in the evenings and on weekends. If good, dedicated teachers are to be maintained, there must be some incentive to keep them. If Gov. Perdue will think back to the time when she was in the classroom, I'm sure she will agree that longetivity pay for teachers is a small token in comparison to the hard work that they do on a daily basis. Another point is - Where does the "education" lottery factor into the education budget? I thought that the lottery was supposed to supply money for education. What is the money from the lottery being used for? I appreciate your response to my concerns. Cindy Weisner

Comment: There is no way you are going to off-set the healthcare cost by raising taxes on cigarettes or alcohol (especially cigarette smoking has decreased- look at WHO; what about fast food?
