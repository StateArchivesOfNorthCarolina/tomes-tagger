Kelley,
I believe this is just a legislative issue that she has.† She is making suggestions on changing the law and her husband is not currently eligible to apply for a pardon.

The Honorable Beverly Perdue

Governor for this Great State of North Carolina,



First Governor, allow me to extend my congratulations to a most successful campaign. As you stated on many occasions, while campaigning across this state; ìIt takes all of us to make it work.î



While your tenure has only begun, it is truly refreshing to see you come out in favor of an open and inclusive government as exemplified in the January 14th Raleigh News and Observer article ìThatís an orderî.î Perdue also signed orders to post state grants and contracts on a central Web site. That's another good public access idea, along with town hall meetings, four of them, during her term. And Perdue was consistent in her campaign in vowing to open state records and conduct business in the open, which wasn't always the case with former Gov. Mike Easley.î



It is very frustrating when one knows of a true injustice and canít seem to get anyone to just look at it unbiased. This is especially true, when considering our present economic state of affairs. Fulfilling the need list should always prioritize the wish list of special interest.



Governor Iím attaching some points for study on my concerns; I truly recognize how busy you are but strongly feel this is deserving of considerations and study by your task force. Please donít hesitate to contact me if I can answer any question or be of service in any way.



Respectfully,



Steven F. Shell

Itís not county. Itís Administrative Office of the Courts. They are not subject to the State Personnel Act. If what she wants is a job, I can send her a reply about that. If what she wants is to complain about her former supervisor, it needs to go to AOC. Your call.

Importance: High

Good afternoon Ms. Tarver,

The Division has received a request from the Office of the Governor to respond to your email†listed below.

Review of our records show that a 2000 TOYT, vin #4T1BG22K3YU670298, with plate #YPC9978 is registered in your name. I also observed your file as showing a Notice of Termination, received by Agent Alliance Insurance Company, displaying†policy #ACI2126392001500, as being terminated on 12/31/2008.†I contacted Agent Alliance Insurance and was advised that your policy did indeed cancel on 12/31/2008 and currently has no insurance being maintained on the aforementioned vehicle. The Division sent a form FS 5/7 informing you of this termination to the address provided by you at the time of registration†on this vehicle. On 02/13/2009,†we received the unopened returned mail as "UNDELIVERED".†††

Ms. Tarver, you mentioned in your email that you did a change of address with the US Postal Service and requested your insurance company to inform the Division of address change. Unfortunately, the procedures used is not acceptable with the Division. According to G.S. 20-67 of the Motor Vehicle Laws of North Carolina, "a person whose address changes from the address stated on the certificate of title or registration card must notify the Division of the change within 60 days after change occurs". If you have not changed your address with the Division, you may do so by sending a written request to:

††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††† NCDMV

Since no insurance is being maintained on this vehicle, it is required by law (G.S. 20-309) for you to turn in plate #YPC9978 for 30 days. Upon relicensing your vehicle on the 31st day at your local NC License Plate Agency, it will be necessary to provide proof of current insurance,†$50.00 restoration and $50 service fees, and appropriate license plate cost. If you feel the findings presented are in error, please do not hestitate to contact me with proof of current insurance?

Subject: National guard IRR member

Comment: Hello, my name is India Bearce and I swore into the NCARNG on Aug 16, 2005. I got married on march 9, 2007 and then I moved to the state of Ohio. I tried to get a transfer, but failed to recieve any communication from either state on this matter. When I finnaly got in contact with some one they told me that I was discharged, so I went on with my life. I had a daughter on March 22, 2008 and then I recieved orders to get mobilized. I have put in for an exemption, but feel that it is not a hard enough hardship to give me the exemption. I am writing to request a discharge from the Military due to the fact they they did not fulfil their obligation to me to help get me a transfer to the state of Ohio.

Governor Bev Purdue
Office of Governor
20301 Mail Service Service Center
Raleigh, North Carolina 27699-0301



Dear Governor Purdue,

I have the privilege of being witness to your first months in office as the first woman governor of this great state of North Carolina. Your tenacity and compassion for your citizens inspires me during this time of our fiscal challenge. I have fallen victim to a bureaucratic anomaly rife with inconsistency and unfairness. Your audience and attention to this issue I am requesting and I will deeply value your input.


I entered the North Carolina Department of Education as a music teacher in Durham, North Carolina in the fall of 2004. Because my degrees are in music performance(Bachelor/ Masters) I was issued a Lateral Entry-Provisional License. I attended all of the Beginning Teacher activities as mandated by the school system and I submitted and successfully completed the observation cycle. In August of 2005, I relocated to Fairfax County where I served successfully, as a music teacher for three years.. I desired to relocate to be closer to my parents and initiated that pursuit in the spring of last year.


I contacted Department of Pupil Instruction (DPI) in May of 2008 and inquired if I would be allowed to teach. A DPI representative informed me that yes, I had two more years on my Provisional/ Lateral Entry license. During these remaining two years, I would be able to fulfill the education requirements that I lack. (As my Bachelors and Masters are in Performance) I simply needed to seek vacant positions, interview, and the interested counties would then contact DPI. I interviewed in the counties of Mecklenburg, Orange, and Guilford. I was offered a contract in Orange County and Guilford County expressed great interest in me as a candidate, but had a concern with DPI. I was told to contact DPI which I did immediately. I was surprised to discover that DPI had switched polices regarding how the 3 years of my license was interpreted. They decided that the three years of a license were to be consecutive. I was told that I would not be eligible to employment as a teacher until August of 2010 or until I was able to take the appropriate classes. This news created great fear turmoil for me, as I am a single mother of two boys, nine and twelve. Plans had been made to relocate to North Carolina based on the May conversation I had with DPI. I was forced to move in with my mother who in September was diagnosed with stage four cancers. The circumstances merited that I cash out my retirement to meet my financial demands. Finally, I became employed as a Teacher‚Äôs Assistant in Wake County. Yes, I was thankful to find work, but I realized that I would be unable to take the coursework that would allow me to teach due to the salary that I would receive. In December I was contacted by DPI with what I thought to be good news. As I was told, DPI realized that there shift in how the three years contract years of the Provisional License had created a financial hardship. I was not the only individual in this predicament. If
I could prove that I was offered a job based upon the initial interpretation of ‚Äúthree years‚Äù I could indeed work. I state that yes, I had been issued a job offer and that I had that contract in my possession. Unfortunately, a month later I was told that I would only be able to teach in the position for which I received an offer. I replied‚Äù ...how absurd...that the position was not open‚Ä¶the position was not held for me‚Ä¶DPI was offering a faux olive branch‚Ä¶‚Äù to which that I was correct‚Ä¶and that yes, it was unfair.

Governor Purdue, it is my hope that you can help me. I want to teach and I am outstanding at what I do. I remain anxious to take the required coursework and I look forward to how it will increase my effectiveness as a music teacher. I want to provide a better standard of living for my two sons and myself. DPI has been unfair to me and I assume that I am not the only person that has experienced this treatment. Whatever you are moved to do or choose to do, I will appreciate and will respect.

With every good wish, I remain‚Ä¶


Denise Forbes

Following is the question just received:

Visitor: Ms. Donna Anne Bean

Address: 535 Bailey Road, Winston-Salem, NC 27107-9013

Email: flrgirl40@yahoo.com 

Subject: department of corrections visitation

Comment: My husband was transfered to Albemarle Correction Facility 10 days ago and I missed a visit that week.I made one for 2 weeks @ their first available time. One was made for this week and then was taken off the computer because they had a visit still on the books for Brown Creek. I spoke w/several people and it could not be fixed do to booking and policy. I had to make it for 8:15 this morning and miss work and leave home befor daylight. The camp policy says you have to call and not personally make a visit as I've done at previous camps for 18 months. I called to make a visit for Sunday 3/05 in the afternoon and it was booked up at 10:25 am. THIS IS OUTRAGIOUS!!!!!!!!!! I have spoken to 2 people in Raleigh today and reffered to a Mr.Lewis Smith on the camp to try and resolve this. I was told he could add more times or seats for the visits. To say he was rude, disagreeable, and down right beligerent is an understatement! I understand policy and inceration but not to be told as long as there is Monday and Tuesday available to visit that if I can't get a visit when I want that I was wasting his time. It seems to me that if I called one and a half hours into the time alloted to make a visit 2 weeks ahead and it's booked-up already that more visits needed to be added! As it is less than 175 visit slots are even available per week for over 850 inmates. That seems to be against human rights! I was also told visitation is a privilage not a right, and the less inmates that got visits the easier it is for the guards. I know they don't WANT them to get visits... but that is part of their job right? And they do work for us tax payers right? I do work and have to drive from Winston and try to follow the rules but I am NOT the inmate and really am tired of being treated as such! Thank-you for your time, DONNA ANNE BEAN flrgirl40@yahoo.com

Mrs. Eileen Lubaszewski

Lake Ariel, PA† 18436



Dear Mrs. Lubaszewski,



The Office of Governor Purdue asked us to respond to your March 23, 2009 email concerning beach nourishment for the Outer Banks of North Carolina.† Although you did not provide the address of your home on the Outer Banks, from your concern over beach erosion voiced in your email, we think that you probably live in the Town of Nags Head in Dare County.† I have answered your question below on that basis -- if that is not the case, please let us know.



There are two efforts underway to provide additional sand on the beaches of Nags Head: one lead by the Wilmington District, U.S. Army Corps of

Engineers and another by the Town of Nags Head.†† The Corps completed a

50-year plan to provide beach nourishment for the developed Dare County beaches (Towns of Nags Head, Kill Devil Hills and Kitty Hawk) about three years ago; however, Congress has not appropriated enough funds to start any beach nourishment work (pre-monitoring has been done).† The Wilmington District is waiting for Congress to appropriate at least $20,000,000 in federal funds so that Phase I of the project can begin.†

That appropriation could occur in a Water Resources Development Act bill that may be passed by Congress later in 2009, but there is a lot of uncertainty with that funding.† The non-federal sponsor of the project, Dare County, would need to provide approximately $12,000,000 in local funds for Phase I.† They would likely ask the State of North Carolina to provide up to 75% cost-sharing funds to help them meet that local share.



Because the Corps project has been delayed and recent erosion has affected many beach homes in the Town of Nags Head, the Town hired a consultant last year to plan and obtain permits for doing an interim local beach nourishment project.† The Town plans to place up to 4.6 million yards of sand on 10 of its 11 miles of beach at a cost of up to $36,000,000.† They have asked the State to provide $11,000,000 in state funds to assist the Town in paying for this project.† The Town expects to begin this nourishment in 2010 if funding is available.



Please let us know if you have further questions.

Subject: Beach Nourishment

Comment: I was wondering if you had any idea if Beach Nourishment will be coming to the Outer Banks, NC. We own a ocean front home and fear that we might lose it to excessive beach erosion. The home next to us is in foreclosure, due to the increase expense of maintaining the property, I feel we may be next, if Nourishment does not come soon. There is so much valuable real estate being lost every year, what a shame. Also do you know of any other parties we could ask for Beach Nourishment support. Thank you, Eileen Lubaszewski

> Right at†the beginning of this letter, I want to establish that I have no desire to personally sit on the North Carolina Historical Commission.†

> †

> However,†I am writing to suggest that your appointments to this†important commission†should allow for a much more inclusive reflection of the racial/ethnic mosaic of North Carolina.

> †

> From my consultation with staffers at Archives and History, it appears that prior to 1975,†no ethnic minorities were appointed to the Historical Commission.†† Since 1975,†there has never been more than one ethnic minority at a time to serve on this eleven-member commission, which has major responsibilities for†the content and the depiction of history†in North Carolina.† It appears that each of the solitary minority members of†the commission have come from one single minority group and from one single section of the state.

> †

> I know that the mere suggestion of a greater inclusion and variety†of minorities on the Historical Commission opens the†door for critics who might†say that this is a request†for a quota system.†† In anticipation of this criticism, I†ask that you think broadly and that you use your appointive authority to include multiple†whites and multiple minorities.† I hope you agree that the important†gate-keeping†duties†of the state's†Historical Commission should†be viewed through the collaborative and composite lenses of†blue, green, ... and brown eyes.†

with the IBM HR staff without any assistance from the National Guard or

CSM Blackwood,



See below update and advise if you require additional information.



I received a call this morning from David Vaughn and he has closed his case

with ESGR National.† He will also contact Tony Clark, NC-ESGR and close any

action he has initiated.



David Vaughn's employer, IBM, has advised him that he will retain his

position while he is mobilized, receive differential pay and will have a

position with IBM when he returns from mobilization.† IBM has also gone

"above and beyond", by allowing David Vaughn time off, with full pay and

benefits, until his mobilization date of 11 May in order to get his personal

affairs completed and arrange for care of his minor, 12 year old sister,

whom Mr. Vaughn is the legal guardian.



This case was successfully mediated by IBM senior HR staff and did not

require action by ESGR or the NCNG.

Subject: Potential Savings of $250,000.00 or more



Dear Governor Perdue,

Would you be interested in saving a 1/4 million ($$)dollars or even more.

A recent renovation of the Governors mansion was required because it had acquired massive amounts of black mold.† This was truly detrimental to those living, working, visiting, and doing business there.† Although age was blamed for some of the renovations it was poor housecleaning habits that contributed to most of the black mold.† Using this as an example, these problems are occurring in many of our state buildings.† It is becoming more unhealthy for the people working there and I can only predict that in the near future there may be lawsuits from people who are being exposed to many health hazards.†

What it boils down to is that the janitorial contracts being issued by the state are managed by many different organizations.† They all have different contracts.† They all have different standards.† The quality of their inspections vary widely.† The demands of the contracts are anywhere from 1 page†to 40 pages.† How can there be such a diversity of service?†

The Department of Administration has some of the large buildings in Raleigh, they have 6 Inspectors for 8 buildings and there are many complaints about their service.† The DOT Support Services have 5 large buildings in Raleigh and have 92 other DMV and DOH†contracts across the State, they only have 2 Inspectors.† The DOH manages many of their own building and coordination is done locally.† Plus, there are many, many, independent state buildings who manage their own contracts and enforcement of the contracts are poor.† Many of our leased building are cleaned by the owners of the buildings and have no established standards of cleaning set by the state.


My proposal is to put all of the cleaning contracts under one organization.† There are plenty of advantages in doing this:


1.† Contract costs can be reduced by regionalizing the contracts and making group bids.


2.† Inspections can be balanced, documented, and done more often.


3.† A higher level of cleaning can be achieved.


4.† Some personnel can be eliminated.


5.† Bidding of multiple contracts can be done competitively, thus reducing overall costs.


6.† Single contract bids can be eliminated.


7.† Poor service can be detected quicker and fixed appropriately.


8.† Bids can be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder.



I'm sure that more advantages can be found if this is thoroughly investigated.† Each one of items mentioned above are there because I have seen these problems and I also see solutions.† Please give me the opportunity to present these issues, explain the problems, and propose solutions.† My work history has give me the knowledge and experience to streamline this project.† I was employed with IBM for 28 years as their Sr. Security Consultant, have been a Diebold employee for 5 years as the Manager of a 12 Million dollar budget, and as a Facilities Inspector for 6 years with the DOT it has given me the time, knowledge, and experience to reorganize the cleaning contracts of the State.† Please give me the opportunity to present this information to you.

Your answer does not make any sense.† I am not a contractor nor a vendor, I work for the DOT and am a Janitorial Facilities Inspector, why would I want to be considered for future contracts as stated in your second paragraph.† My proposal to the Governor was to merge most all of the janitorial contracts in the state in order to save money and merge many of the contracts.† I do hope someone in the Office of the Governor can understand this.

Your answer does not make any sense.† I am not a contractor nor a vendor, I work for the DOT and am a Janitorial Facilities Inspector, why would I want to be considered for future contracts as stated in your second paragraph.† My proposal to the Governor was to merge most all of the janitorial contracts in the state in order to save money and merge many of the contracts.† I do hope someone in the Office of the Governor can understand this.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Would you be interested in saving a 1/4 million ($$)dollars or even more.

A recent renovation of the Governors mansion was required because it had acquired massive amounts of black mold.† This was truly detrimental to those living, working, visiting, and doing business there.† Although age was blamed for some of the renovations it was poor housecleaning habits that contributed to most of the black mold.† Using this as an example, these problems are occurring in many of our state buildings.† It is becoming more unhealthy for the people working there and I can only predict that in the near future there may be lawsuits from people who are being exposed to many health hazards.†

Denise:

I have spoken to Rob†and reviewed his emails with you.† It appears that there was some confusion about the†R-3307 project and the possibility of it being a stimulus and design/build project.† This project was originally being considered as a possible stimulus project, but due to unresolved issues, it was not included as part of the stimulus package. †Rob was correct in directing you to NCDOT for clarification. †I will also†forward the emails between Rob and you that I have on this topic.

It is not always feasible to have a series of large projects consolidated into one project or done consecutively.††There are†considerations given to the condition of the bridges, which may necessitate doing one sooner than the other. The projects may also have a different purpose and needs and NCDOT has to comply with the NEPA merger process.

Traffic Survey manages a traffic monitoring program for NCDOT to meet Federal reporting requirements as well as support planning activities.††Their primary product in this process is Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT).††The AADT just east of the Graydon Paul Drawbridge on US 70 was 19,000 vehicles per day in 2007.† Here is a link to the 2007 and earlier AADT maps for reference:

<http://ncdot.org/it/img/DataDistribution/TrafficSurveyMaps/>http://ncdot.org/it/img/DataDistribution/TrafficSurveyMaps/

Annual average daily traffic is an estimate of a daily volume that accounts for seasonal variation and is between the peak volumes of summer traffic and†lower volumes†of the winter season.† The technique used is consistent with the procedures recommended in the FHWA Traffic Monitoring Guide and meet the Highway Performance Monitoring System requirements.††The count data†is collected using tube based counters at each monitoring station for 48 hours on weekdays.† These raw counts are factored using an Axle Factor to adjust from an axle pair count to a volume count and a seasonal factor to adjust for day of week and monthly variation in daily traffic volumes.† Here is a link to our webpage describing the process:

<http://www.ncdot.org/doh/preconstruct/tpb/traffic_survey/>http://www.ncdot.org/doh/preconstruct/tpb/traffic_survey/

The NCDOT† Program Development Branch has sent you documentation for†the R-4431 Project which includes the traffic forecast information.† If you still have questions, please feel free to contact me.

Betty,

I find you answers to be rather strange.† According to the Down East RPO TIP list, project R-3307 IS shovel ready.† Rob Will told me he got that information from DOT.† Who is being untruthful, DOT or Rob Will?† When I asked Rob the same questions I am asking you, he referred me to DOT and said that he did not have the answers.† Obviously the right hand does not what the left hand is doing at DOT if someone in your organization put R-3307 on the TIP list as shovel ready.† Please explain in detail how this happened.

I am well aware that the Northern Carteret Bypass is a separate project from the Gallants Channel project, however I believe you missed the point of my questions.† The Northern Bypass dumps into the Gallants Channel Project which dumps onto the Newport River high rise bridge between Beaufort and Morehead City.† Why are all three projects not sitting together on the TIP list?† What exactly is the point of doing things in a piecemeal manner, is that not potentially more costly?

Finally, does DOT have any actual traffic counts for the Grayden Paul bridge†and not just guesstimates of what may or may not be?† If so, when were they done and what was the method?

The Northern Carteret Bypass (R-4431) is a separate project from the US 70 Improvements Project (R-3307) which includes the Gallants Channel Bridge in Carteret County.† The TIP Project R-3307 is not 'shovel ready'. †When projects were initially being considered†as Stimulus Projects, R-3307 had been†suggested as a Design-Build Project.† It was later filtered out and is not a candidate as a Stimulus Project.

There are 121 parcels on R-3307, seven of which have been settled. Presently there has been one relocation.

The Northern Bypass†Estimated Average Daily Traffic Counts (ADT), ranging†from 6,300†to 13,500 for the current year and†9,300 to 20,200 for the year 2030,†were†from a Draft Feasibility†Study and originated from the Traffic Forecasting Report.† The 2007 ADT for the Graydon Paul Bridge is 19,000. The†ADT for the R-3307 Project is estimated at 27,620 for the year 2011 and 39,389 for the year†2031.†An ADT†forecast includes assumptions†for exiting traffic, in this case, at locations such as NC 101, US 70 across†the North River, and at Turner Street.† The traffic for the Northern Carteret Bypass varies significantly depending on which alternative is used.

The need for the R-3307 Project is based on delays due to the drawbridge, traffic volumes/capacity, accident history, and regional planning.††The bridge you are referring to as the 'Morehead City-Beaufort High Rise Bridge'†is over the†Newport River and†is not a drawbridge.††Thus it†will have a different need.††These†two†bridges will have†their own needs, and time frame for planning, design, and construction.

> Betty,

I saw that the Carteret County Transportation Committee has endorsed a Northern By-pass as an addition to the Gallants Channel Project.

I have several questions about both the Gallants Channel Project and the proposed Northern By-pass.

1)††† The Gallants Channel Project is showing up on the State's and the County's TIP lists as shovel ready, however when I asked Rob Will, the DERPO representative, what parts are shovel ready he had no real answer and suggested I contact you.†
††† With the bridge still not engineered, I must ask how this project can be shoveled ready.† If I understand correctly, to date, DOT has only obtained rights-of-way from four property owners, is this correct?† How many parcels does DOT need to get rights-of-way from?† Exactly what aspects of the Gallants Channel project ARE shovel ready?

2)††† I read that†for the Northern By-pass the estimated current-year average daily traffic counts will be 6,300 vehicles per day east of US 70 and 13,500 vehicles per day just north of the Gallants Channel project.† Where did these figures come from?† If you are using the numbers DOT currently cites for the Graydon Paul drawbridge traffic counts, your numbers are highly skewed.† I have had someone doing actual physical traffic counts on the bridge for several years now and DOT's numbers are almost double that of the actual traffic counts.† Do you have any explaination for this major discrepancy?

3)††† On the TIP lists, the Morehead City-Beaufort high rise†bridge expansion from†2 to†4 lanes is nowhere near the Gallants Channel project.† Can you explain why since all the traffic travelling across this proposed Gallants Channel multi-million dollar road project will dump four lanes of high speed traffic onto a two lane bridge.† Shouldn't the two projects be built in conjunction with each other for safety reasons.† After all, safety is the main reason being cited by DOT for the Gallants Channel project.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I agree that the project should not be considered ëshovel-readyí. My understanding is that there are small or stalled projects that are really ready-to-go, with permits and all that in place, and then there are the bigger ones that could let as design-build and would still meet the federal requirement of being bid out within the 180 days.† So, I guess it may not be considered shovel-ready, but ratherÖ stimulus-ready?



I agree with your point about the non-contiguous parcels, I guess I thought they had more.† I see where the airport has purchased a chunk.



Sorry I am not more help, you may want to call the DOT folks up in Greenville for further clarification on why the Gallants channel is on there.† I have not given it much consideration because of the cost ñ there is probably not going to be that much stimulus money (the biggest project in the first round was 64 million in Kinston) but I will see what the RPOís priorities will be after our March meeting.



Have a great weekend,

I understand that, however, I do not believe the ROW acquisitions already attained are not†even next to each other, thus, as far as I can tell, they may be able to design and construct perhaps one lot, but then will need to skip over several lots before they can design and construct any more.† This seems to be a rather stupid approach as far as I am concerned, therefore I still do not understand how it can be deemed 'shovel-ready'.

Dear Governor Perdue;    

 

I am writing you with a big concern.   

 

I just moved up here a year ago from Florida after my mom and my husband
died!  My son and granddaughter live here.  After getting a job on the wrong
side of town and being threaten, I finally got away and did find another job
6 months ago but after I found my job, because of what the other job did to
me I had to move in with my son which is a single parent and put all my
belongings for the most part in storage.

 

 My son then lost his job and we tried to do his own business doing courier,
but we just didn't have enough capitol to keep going and with the economy
getting back we had to let it go, but  in the mean time he totaled out his
car no fault of his and so now we were down to my car, 3 months after I
totaled my car out on 440 no fault of mine.  Now both cars are paid off but
no money for another.

 

With the bills and mortgage still having to be paid my son still isn't
having any luck finding a job.  We worked hard for out money last year and
now the point.

 

We are one of the lucky one in the fact that we are getting a refund from
the state BUT now you are saying we are not getting our refunds!!!!  What
are we going to do for food and everything else.? WE need our money please
release it.

 

Sincerely;

Jay Burgher & Dianne Sauer

> Governor Breaks Ground on First Economic Recovery Highway Project

Gov. Bev Perdue was joined by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and†local elected officials in Camden County at a groundbreaking on Thursday†for one of North Carolinaís first highway improvement projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The event was held at the George M. Wood Memorial Park on U.S. 158 in Camden County near the Camden/Pasquotank County line.

> †

> The $6.1 million project will widen a congested 2.4-mile stretch of U.S. 158 from east of the Pasquotank River to north of Havenwood Drive in Elizabeth City from two to four lanes. The highway is known locally as the Camden Causeway and serves as the main link between Elizabeth City and Camden and Currituck counties.

> †

> ìThis recovery project will make a significant contribution to Camden County and this region now and in the future,î Perdue said.† ìIt will quickly put people to work and have a significant economic impact.† Improving U.S. 158 helps northeastern North Carolina prepare for future growth and ensures this region is ready when new opportunities arise.î

> †

> The U.S. 158 widening project is one of 11 economic recovery projects awarded to contract in March. The projects are located in Alamance, Brunswick, Camden, Currituck, Forsyth/Stokes, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Scotland and Stanly counties.† It is also one of the $466 million first phase recovery infrastructure projects that are expected to create and sustain 14,000 jobs across the state.

Perdue is asking the commission to consider rededicating the public resource -- the river and the power generated by the dam ñ to public use that would serve the citizens and help North Carolinaís economy.

> †

> ìThe waters of the Yadkin River belong to the people of North Carolina.† Fifty years ago, we endorsed Alcoaís request for a federal license to operate hydroelectric dams on the river because they powered the companyís aluminum smelting works.† That facility was a linchpin in the regional economy and created jobs for up to 1000 North Carolina workers.î† said Gov. Perdue. ìToday the smelter and the jobs are gone ñ and so is the reason for the license.† Iím asking FERC to enable the recapture of the license so it can be used once† again to help create jobs and economic opportunity for the region.î

Subject: Status of NC Tax Refund

 

Dear Governor Perdue,

 

I understand that the state of North Carolina is currently in a budget
crunch. But I would like to request your assistance in speeding up the
refund checks to NC taxpayers like myself. My taxes were paid to the state
of North Carolina throughout the entire tax year of 2008. I e-filed my joint
federal and state tax returns through H&R Block on February 21. My refund
status on the NC Department of Revenue website has been "in process" for the
past 2 weeks.

 

I need my NC refund because my family is experiencing financial hardships.
My husband, who is a self-employed graphic designer, has seen his income
reduced by two thirds. My salary alone is not suffiecient to cover our
mortgage and other monthly expenses. Our home has been on the market for a
month, and no one has even made an inquiry. We need this money to pay for
unexpected auto repairs and our mortgage. I would appreciate whatever you
can do to reallocate funds to start paying tax refunds that are due.

 

Regards,

 

Denise Cole

‚ÄúMy goal is for North Carolina to be a national leader in health care,‚Äù said Perdue during a kick off event at the East Carolina Heart Institute in Greenville. ‚ÄúCracking down on chronic disease will save lives, it will lessen the heavy burden of medical costs that many families face, and it will reduce health care expenses for our state.‚Äù

As national policy-makers consider new approaches to health care, PFCD amplifies the voices of individual states concerned about the millions of lives and billions of dollars lost to chronic disease.† a state level, PFCD brings together dozens of leading health care organizations (39 and counting) to share best practices and new ideas.†

Speaking alongside Gov. Perdue, Dr. Paul R.G. Cunningham, dean of the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University and co-chair of the NC PFCD, said, "To truly address the health care of every North Carolinian and American, comprehensive reform must go beyond providing better coverage.† It also must address chronic disease, the number one driver of health problems in our nation."

Cancer, heart disease, asthma, obesity and other chronic diseases claim 1.7 million American lives per year and cost more than $1.5 trillion. The toll on North Carolina is also devastating, and threatens to get worse.†


Operation Slow Down

Monday, Gov. Bev Perdue announced†that the N.C. State Highway Patrol and the Governor‚Äôs Highway Safety Program†were kicking off Operation Slow Down/No Need 2 Speed to catch speeders on North Carolina‚Äôs highways. Local law enforcement agencies will join troopers from now through April 12 to encourage drivers to slow down and follow the speed limit.

‚ÄúNorth Carolina law enforcement will be going after speeders who recklessly endanger our citizens,‚Äù said Perdue. ‚ÄúSpeed is the leading cause of crashes on our highways. I urge motorists to slow down and obey the speed limit. ‚Äù

Last year 1,405 people were killed in traffic crashes on North Carolina highways; speed was the leading cause of those crashes.† Stepped-up enforcement will be conducted across the state, focusing on motorists speeding.

Dangerous driving can be reported to the Highway Patrol by dialing *HP on cellular phones from anywhere in the state. For more information about Operation Slow Down 2009, visit the N.C. Department of Crime Control and Public Safety‚Äôs Web site at <http://www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp>www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp. For more information on No Need 2 Speed, go to the Governor's Highway Safety Program Web site at <http://www.ncdot.org/programs/GHSP/>http://www.ncdot.org/programs/GHSP/.

Dear Legislators,



As many of you know, Down East Partnership for Children has been committed to launching every child as a lifelong learner for more than 15 years. We are making progress towards achieving this vision with the help of community leaders, parents and you, our legislative delegation. You remain longtime supporters of our most valuable resource, our children. That is why each year; we bring community and legislators together to review the current state of the children in Nash & Edgecombe counties at our State of the Child Briefing, April 20, 2009 from 11:30-1:30 at our offices in Rocky Mount.



To date we have heard from two of you who have agreed to attend but we are still awaiting a response from several of you. While I have had the opportunity to hear you speak about your commitment to education in Nash & Edgecombe counties, many of our guests have not. We at DEPC are confident that you will want to be a part of this event. To allow us to plan accordingly, RSVP to this email.



Should you need additional information, please contact me at the number below. We look forward to hearing from each of you.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Although I am not a citizen of your wonderful state I did serve there while in the military service years ago. The reason I am asking for your help is because nobody else wants to assist me with anything except taking my money. Over twenty years ago, closer to twenty-one, I received two traffic violations, that I did pay for, but no record can be found. I am not denying these tickets, just that they were paid for years ago. Now after all these years and numerous license renewals I'm told that my money was never received. The courts and the District Attorneys say that I must hire an attorney which being a laid-off auto worker is impossible for me financially. Surely these two tickets, paid for once already, could not cause as much financial hardship for these two counties as it would for†my family. I'm not a criminal nor someone trying to not pay for his mistakes. I know that you must be very busy, but if there is anything you could be I would be very appreciative. The counties is question are McDowell (ref #88IF2571)and Duplin (ref #89IF112), both fines were mailed in prior to my deployments. I thank you for your time.



Respectfully,

Timothy E. Head

Governor Perdue takes Additional Steps to Manage State's Cash Flow

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Thursday†instructed the Office of State Budget Management† to take steps to manage the stateís cash flow in order to meet its financial obligations.



Effective immediately,†the Governor enacted additional limitations on spending throughout state government, including freezing the purchase of goods and services, ceasing all travel not approved for public safety, public health and economic development reasons, and leaving unfilled personnel positions vacant. Exceptions may be made for direct classroom instruction expenses and emergency situations related to law enforcement, health care and public safety



ìNorth Carolina continues to face budgeting challenges. My decision to limit agency spending is crucial to North Carolinaís ability to meet our financial obligations and to provide essential services†for our citizens,î said Gov. Perdue.



Additionally, Gov. Perdue identified 18 areas from which some $145 million in funds will be transferred to maintain cash flow in the General Fund.† <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=289>For the list, click here.



Scotland County Adds Natural-Products Manufacturer, 98 Jobs

Natureís Earth Products Inc., the nationís largest supplier of natural cat litter and manufacturer of hardwood-blend fuel pellets, is opening a new manufacturing facility in Laurinburg.† The company plans to invest more than $12 million and create 98 jobs during the next three years in Scotland County.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $196,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.



ìNorth Carolinaís forward-looking policies continue to attract companies specializing in emerging green-industry markets,î Gov. Perdue said.† ìOur stateís skilled workforce, top-rated business climate and extraordinary quality of life offer the perfect environment for businesses like this one to locate and expand here.î



The One North Carolina Fund provides financial assistance, through local governments, to attract business projects that will stimulate economic activity and create new jobs in the state.† Companies receive no money up front and must meet job creation and investment performance standards to qualify for grant funds.† All of these grants also require and are contingent upon local matches.



Through use of the One North Carolina Fund, more than 35,000 jobs and $6.5 billion in investment have been created since 2001.† Project partners include: the state Department of Commerce, Scotland County, City of Laurinburg and the N.C. Rural Center.



Jackson County Manufacturer to Add 61 Jobs

Stonewall Packaging LLC, a joint project of <http://www.jacksonpaper-nc.com>Jackson Paper Manufacturing Co., is building a new plant in Sylva to produce recycled cardboard packaging.† The company plans to invest more than $16 million to renovate and modify a vacant mill, creating 61 jobs in Jackson County.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $200,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.



ìAs global markets evolve, North Carolinaís manufacturing sector is keeping pace to take advantage of new opportunities,î Gov. Perdue said.† ìCompanies like this one are investing in green-friendly products while continuing to enjoy our stateís top-rated business climate, skilled workforce and unparalleled quality of life.î



The 61 new jobs will pay an average of $39,344, not including benefits, which is more than the Jackson County average annual wage of $27,820.† The company will begin hiring this summer.



Project partners include: the state Department of Commerce, the Department of Revenue, Department of Transportation, N.C. Community Colleges, Southwestern Community College, Jackson County, the Town of Sylva, the N.C. Rural Center and Duke Energy.



Growing†a Green Economy

Speaking at a Charlotte energy summit on Monday, Gov. Perdue reiterated her view that North Carolina is poised to lead the nationís green economy.† As she said in her speech: ìThe state that gets green right will own the next 50 years ñ and North Carolina must be that state.î†

Good Morning everyone.† I spoke with Ms. Morris this morning regarding her husband's suspension for Habitual Impaired Driving.† I explained to her under statue G.S. 20-138.5 (Habitual Impaired driving) "A person convicted under this section shall have his license permanently suspended." I explained to her also that the statue does not allow for any type of hearing and she would need to go back to the court system in Carteret co regarding the conviction on 95crs10914 and also on 94crs1066 and have the judge at the time to over turn any previous verdict at the time of conviction.† I also explained to her that the Division had not yet received any 508 forms on the offense dates of 4/25/93, 11/22/92, or 09/13/91 and that also there was an outstanding fine in Carteret co on 92cr10970 and that these issues must be cleared up as well.
Have a great day.

Dear†Beverly Perdue,

I have been writing for years to anyone and everyone I can in reference to my husband's situation.† I was given your e-mail by my county representative's office Pat McElraft.† Here's the condensed version:† my husband lost his license over 12 years ago for habitual DUI's'.† He served time for them as well ~ over 12 years ago.† He has been clean and sober for over 12 years, he has dedicated his entire life to serving God through our church as well as the way he lives his life.† We are a part of a ministry team that visits the Newport Prison that he was inncarcerated†at.† I have been told that there is no way for him to get his driving status changed ~ period.† Being the woman that I am ~ periods belong at the end of a sentence or define time spans that have a beginning and an end.† He is 54 now, he has tried the "good" lawyer route and has been told by them that the only way he will ever drive again is if an ammendment to the GS he violated†is passed.† I have been told by political persons that no one wants to deal with the issue.† I have kept up with all that you are doing in the short time you have been in office†~ it is impressive to say the least.† Way back when I started this crusade, I told Governor Easley that I didn't want to open the flood gates for habitual drunk drivers to be able to drive - I know first hand that there are those who should not be driving and those who†deserve a second chance after proving themselves upright and law abiding, as well as totally reformed.† My grandma was killed by a drunk driver, drunk driving has caused immense turmoil in my family form lost driving privileges to death ~ seems stupidity has no limit, nor does addiction.† I have served as an Alanon public information chairman in Florida ~ excessive drinking has been a factor in my entire existence.† My husband is†one of my heroes ~ and just because he is my husband - if he were not what I claim him to be, I would not back him or fight for him ~ he needs to be able to drive as much as I need him to ~ we, like many others have elderly parents to take care of, children in need and g'babies to tend to ~ as well as each other.† Please help me in any way you can ~ I appreciate your time and win or lose ~†this is a battle I will not give up on.†

Thank you,

Subject: North Carolina needs to abide by Federal Law

Comment: Because NC does not abide by Federal law, taxpayers monies are being waisted. We are currently housing too many prisoners due to state definitions of marijuana which allows the wet weight of marijuana plants to be used to determine whether or not a person is charged with trafficking or not. Federal law requires that the drug be weighed dry. Reality is...the wet plant cannot be consumed and it not usable, why then is it allowed to be weighed? We are looking for ways to cut budgets...and at the same time waisting millions of taxpayers dollars by incarcerating far too many people. Like Senator Webb stated recently, we are either some of the meanest people in the world, or our laws are simply too harsh. I, like him, believe our laws are too harsh.

Thank You For Your Time, One Inmates opus #†0566688 see where our money is going, this is very bad judgement and cost us alot of money,

I have other†opus #'s this is one of the most extreme for the incident at hand, one to have to think that personalities are involved, because someone sure went over and beyond†the call of duty to get this incident this over blown.

†He had not†had any write up in the past 3 years, he was out on sponsor passes for over 6 months.

He left WCC at 5:30 and returned to†WCC at 9:30 every pass. It was written up that he got out just to see this girl that†it was all set up.

†Michael†knows everyone at that meeting and what there positions are, was he just supposed to stop going to meetings. He had already put in a transfer.†

Michael was not trying to hide anything. There was nothing to hide.

Everything was on the table, in writing to Mr. Harless. Yet he continued†on with more punishment as time went on.†

He told Michael he would not be demoted to medium custody if he plead guilty.†

He plead guilty, he was later demoted, to medium custody and visitations taken away for 6 mo, as of 2/18/09, incident†occurred†01/28/09†he was demoted on 02/23/09, he had already been put in a hole for 45 days, loss of privileges for† 60 days, limited draw for 3 mo. He has† been locked for 13 years, he is not a threat to society.

He is one of the nicest guys that has ever walked into the program, I am certain that was not the case† when he was 19, however that was a very long time ago, he has grown up a lot.

He was drinking when he committed that crime, he is clean and sober today.He has 1 year and 7 months to go.

He is healthy and physically capable of working, and something like this has thrown†him all the way back to where he started because he was a violent offender when he was 19.†

So they say he used poor judgement, Well in the big picture maybe†Harless used† poor judgement to have blown this incident into something that it just was not.

Every phone call was recorded, every time he went out on pass, every time he put in for a transfer all of this is recorded please listen to all conversations not just one.

Michael talked about meeting every night not just on the night that he got a pass.

Really it is not rocket science. †

Things were taken way out of context, and he is having to pay the price, because someone will not take the time to listen to the real story.


Our†system is broken and many of us†do not feel that our tax dollars should be spent†like this.†

This is not the first of its kind, our economy is too messed up to continue to house long term people in medium custody that are not a threat to any one and have learned a valuable lesson, and are just being human, doing human things like making friends and building a network of clean and sober people in the community.†

Our Group feels†he is a great guy and a huge part of our group.†

Thank You Again For Your Time.††

Please contact me any time.

The State Health Plan (the Plan) is in receipt of†an email you forwarded to the Honorable Governor Beverly Perdue's office concerning the State Health Plan and its creation by the General Assembly of North Carolina.

According to the applicable provisions and limitations of North Carolina General Statutes Chapter 135-45 entitled "Undertaking" explains what the Plan was created for and how it will be operated. The Plan was first made self-funded by the General Assembly in 1982.† I have included the actual statutes that explains the Plan's operations.
¬ß 135‚Äë45.† Undertaking.

(a)†††††† The State of North Carolina undertakes to make available a State Health Plan (hereinafter called the "Plan") exclusively for the benefit of eligible employees, eligible retired employees, and certain of their eligible dependents, which will pay benefits in accordance with the terms of this Article. The Plan shall have all the powers and privileges of a corporation and shall be known as the State Health Plan for Teachers and State Employees. The Executive Administrator and Board of Trustees shall carry out their duties and responsibilities as fiduciaries for the Plan. The Plan shall administer one or more group health plans that are comprehensive in coverage and shall provide eligible employees and retired employees coverage on a noncontributory basis under at least one of the group plans with benefits equal to that specified in subsection (g) of this section. The Executive Administrator and Board of Trustees may operate group plans as a preferred provider option, or health maintenance, point‚Äëof‚Äëservice, or other organizational arrangement and may offer the plans to employees and retirees on a noncontributory or partially contributory basis. Plans offered on a partially contributory basis must provide benefits that are additional to that specified in subsection (g) of this section and may not be offered unless approved in an act of the General Assembly.

(b)†††††† Individuals eligible for coverage under G.S. 135‚Äë45.2 on a fully or partially contributory basis are eligible to participate in any plan authorized under this section.

(c)†††††† The State of North Carolina deems it to be in the public interest for North Carolina firefighters, rescue squad workers, and members of the national guard, and certain of their dependents, who are not eligible for any other type of comprehensive group health insurance or other comprehensive group health benefits, and who have been without any form of group health insurance or other comprehensive group health benefit coverage for at least six consecutive months, to be given the opportunity to participate in the benefits provided by the State Health Plan for Teachers and State Employees. Coverage under the Plan shall be voluntary for eligible firefighters, rescue squad workers, and members of the national guard who elect participation in the Plan for themselves and their eligible dependents.

(d)†††††† The Plan benefits shall be provided under contracts between the Plan and the claims processors selected by the Plan. The Executive Administrator may contract with a pharmacy benefits manager to administer pharmacy benefits under the Plan. Such contracts shall include the applicable provisions of G.S. 135‚Äë45.1 through G.S. 135‚Äë45.15 and the description of the Plan in the request for proposal, and shall be administered by the respective claims processor or Pharmacy Benefits Manager, which will determine benefits and other questions arising thereunder. The contracts necessarily will conform to applicable State law. If any of the provisions of G.S. 135‚Äë45.1 through G.S. 135‚Äë45.15 and the request for proposals must be modified for inclusion in the contract because of State law, such modification shall be made.

(e)†††††† Payroll deduction shall be available for coverage under this Part for subscribers able to meet the Plan's requirements for payroll deduction.

(f)††††††† Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, the Executive Administrator and Board of Trustees are specifically authorized to use all appropriate means to secure tax qualification of the Plan under any applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as amended. The Executive Administrator and Board of Trustees shall furthermore comply with all applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as amended, to the extent that this compliance is not prohibited by this Article.

(g)†††††† The Executive Administrator and Board of Trustees shall not change the Plan's comprehensive health benefit coverage, co‚Äëpayments, deductibles, out‚Äëof‚Äëpocket expenditures, and lifetime maximums in effect on July 1, 2008, that would result in a net increased cost to the Plan or in a reduction in benefits to Plan members unless and until the proposed changes are directed to be made in an act of the General Assembly. †(2008‚Äë168, s. 3(c).)

The North Carolina General Assembly determines benefits for the Plan and has the authority to change benefits.

I hope this information is helpful.

Dear Ms. Wagoner:

Your email to the Governor's office was referred to me for response regarding I-40.

It appears you were referring to a project that calls for resurfacing, concrete pavement removal and guardrail work from mile marker 119 in Burke County through mile marker 146 in Iredell County. If so, that is not a project being handled by NCDOT workers, but by the Maymead, Inc. contracting company of Mountain City, Tenn. It was awarded a $28.375 million contract for the work in March 2008. The†project started April 28, 2008 and per contract terms, is to be completed by June 30, 2010.

That contract allows work to take place on weekends, as that should help the contractor complete the project in a faster manner, providing motorists with an improved interstate in a shorter time span. The contractor has limits on when traffic lanes can be closed, which become even more restrictive during times of heavy travel, such as holidays, holiday weekends and special events.

Motorists travelling through North Carolina this year will be coming across more construction work than in the past, which means drivers should expect some delays along the way. Each interstate in the state will have some sort of construction project under way at one time or another, making this one of the most active construction seasons in recent years. The NCDOT is taking advantage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, as well as Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles, or GARVEE bonds, which allow†it to borrow against future federal funding†to provide much-needed road improvements across the state.††

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott
NCDOT Communications Officer†

Following is the question just received:

Address: PO Box 157, Icard, NC 28666

Email: lcwagoner@hotmail.com

Subject: DOT; Charlotte Office; Schools

Comment: Governor Perdue: First, I want to ask why my tax dollars were being spent on a Sunday in Catawba Cty., on I-40 from exits 118 to 126, with a line of traffic from those exits markers? Don't we pay them overtime and double time on Sunday to work? Why??? They were doing nothing and I know this because I went east to Hickory and then west to home several hours later. All I saw them doing was riding in their trucks in the closed eastbound lane and standing outside their trucks with containers in their hands. No emergency, just out there, for what? I am sure that DOT will give you the incorrect answer to pacify, but the right answer is nothing. Never have they ever been out on Sunday to patch those large deep holes dug in the interstate before. Do some planning next time and work on week days, not weekends and back traffic for miles. Next, let me direct and say I think with the economy as bad as it is, to open a satellite office in Charlotte was a bad idea! This is not something that was going to make or break your office. And, let's face it, Charlotte has gotten so big headed that they wanted to change the capital from Raleigh to Charlotte! Give me a break. I was born in NC and if Charlotte ever succeeds in changing the capital, I wil move out of NC! With the crime and most of the business owners from out-of-state, I think that Charlotte has taken on the persona of another Atlanta, which I avoid also. Third, schools. Put back all the responsibility of the child into the hands of the parent/guardian! No faculty, no staff, or any other student should have to endure what some students cast off on them including such profanity and threats, that would curl your hair. These students lack the guidance and discipline and respect from their parents and they don't care who they reap their anger on, including their parents/guardians. The government has made the parent afraid to give discipline. The child is more learned on the laws of the DSS and they threaten their parents/guardians and anyone else with it. (I know this because I overheard a conversation from several students on just this subject). My parents made it clear what the rules were and I obeyed those rules because I knew they meant it. Too bad there aren't more of my parents around because I didn't turn out too bad. I have worked many years, every day, stay out of trouble, don't drink, never took drugs, never smoked. I passed those parenting skills onto my children and they have turned out well also. I have a philosophy; I will not put into my body that which is habit forming, defies me of memory or capacities, and takes money that I have to work so hard for. I thank my parents for teaching me I don't need these things to make good sound judgement and to withstand life's trials and tragedies.
