Comment: I talked with Governor Purdue's scheduler just after the election, which I and my members worked very hard on. I was requesting a meeting to talk about our legislative agenda for this upcoming session. I was told I would at the least get a meeting with Zach Ambrose, or her transportation person. It would seem now that it has been two months with not contact, we have been forgoten. My Union, the United Transportation Union one of the largest in the state, was the first to endorse her. If a meeting with her or staff is not possible, just say so. Richard Westbrook Director, UTU NC Legislative Board 204 Forest Manor Drive Garner, NC 27529 919-801-4110

Dear Governor Perdue,
    I'm very excided to have a girl governor!! I would really like to come to the Governor's Mansion and meet you so I would love it if you would buy some Girl Scout Cookies.

I'll collect the money when the cookies arrive.

Your old favorites are still here.
Thin Mints,
Peanut Butter Sandwiches,
chocolate covered Peanut Butter Patties,
yummy Caramel Delights,
and Shortbread.

This year there are three flavors you may not have tried.
There is a large round lemon flavored cookie called LemonAdes,

With your background as an educator,I would like to personally invite you and your staff to our annual Chairs of Hope benefit at Vandora Springs Elementary here in Garner.

Please also consider this an open invite for any of your family and staff. Thanks again for your time and cosideration.

Hi Sharon,



I’m Kelley McFarland and I am handling Gov. Perdue’s emails for the time being. I previously handled Gov. Easley’s email as well. I will be forwarding any email requests for meetings to you. I generally just forwarded it with no message, but you’ll see the person’s last name, first name and (Meeting) in the subject line. I’ll keep a copy of the email on my end so should you need me to re-forward anything, just let me know. Also, if you have any questions or requests for me to handle differently, please let me know that as well!

Thank you,

Kelley

Comment: I am writing to you in hopes that our two companies ZonaMed and ZonaLaw may in some way help improve the status of communicating with foreign immigrants especially the Hispanic community. Both corporations are proudly based in North Carolina, but the services are offered worldwide. ZonaMed and ZonaLaw were established after extensive research on the shortage of services for the ever growing Spanish population. ZonaMed is a multi-lingual health information and video interpretation website. ZonaLaw is a multi-lingual video interpretation website targeting attorneys, state and local government, law enforcement agencies and insurance companies. Both companies are innovative in establishing a forum for people of different languages to easily communicate with one another using our online state-of-art video interpretation service. This service can be beneficial for all state and government offices pertaining either to health, law enforcement, emergency services, judicial branches, and all social service agencies. This service is offered in a very cost effective form. The user of this service does not require to purchase special equipment, pay for set-up fees, or pay monthly maintenance fees. The user need only to have access to a computer with internet connection capabilities. At this time, I would be honored to meet with you or one of your staff members, in order to have the opportunity to further explain how ZonaMed or ZonaLaw can be beneficial to all branches of government in dealing with the problematic language barrier. Please feel free to visit our website at www.zonamed.com or www.zonalaw.com. If you wish to speak with me further you may contact me either by phone at 919-601-3051 or via email at egallo@zonamed.com. Thank you. Regards, Ernest Gallo President/CEO ZonaMed/ZonaLaw

I am requesting a meeting to showcase my company's ability to increase the detection of outdoor marijuana operations with increased apprehension / arrest results at dramatically lower cost opposed to what is currently being utilized. I am quite familiar with the RAID Program, having flown with the program several years as a pilot with the NC Guard. The NC Sheriffs' Association is supportive of this meeting as well. This could represent considerable savings to the State of North Carolina by reducing the direct /indirect use of NC National Guard, State Highway Patrol, State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) and local agency's aircraft and ground based manpower. I look forward to your reply. Sincerely, Shawn Harris

Subject: Governor Perdue to UNC?

Dear Governor-elect Perdue's office,

Greetings!  My name is Justin Rosenthal and I am the Co-President of UNC-Chapel Hill Young Democrats.  Our organization is currently planning our schedule for the upcoming semester.  

In 2008, North Carolina saw more young people than ever before become actively involved in politics. Now, our challenge is to keep them involved in the Democratic Party. The importance of this task should not be underestimated. There are many people for whom this cycle was their first experience volunteering for a campaign. These people will stay involved only if we keep actively reaching out to them – involving them in the legislative process, the midterm elections, and beyond.

We understand how busy Governor-elect Perdue's office must be, but we would like to invite her to come speak at UNC-Chapel Hill to discuss how he and other leaders are working to address the challenges facing North Carolina, as a way to keep college students informed about and involved in the activities of their government.  

Let me know if you think she would be available to speak at UNC-Chapel Hill sometime this semester. Our weekly general body meetings are regularly scheduled for Mondays, but we are able to work around her schedule if Mondays are not feasible for her.

P.S. UNC Young Democrats will also be hosting an internship fair in the evening of Monday, February 16th to promote summer internship/volunteer opportunities to students. Would someone from your office be able to attend? This is an excellent opportunity to recruit volunteers and interns. When we hosted our last internship fair in fall 2007, hundreds of students attended, along with 48 campaigns, student organizations, and local nonprofits.

Thanks so much,

Justin Rosenthal
Co-President, UNC-Chapel Hill Young Democrats

Subject: Possibly spam: National Green Week

Dear Mrs. Bev Purdue,


My name is Charles OrgBon and I am the President of the Saint Anthony Catholic School Earth Savers Association. I am in the seventh grade at Saint Anthony School, which is a small school of only 188 children in West Florence, very close to West Florence High School.


The Earth Savers is leading events in our school that we have planned for National Green Week (Feb. 2-6).


Our school is planning on have trash pick up, where we will pick up trash around our school campus. We will also improve the flower garden that was planted last year in honor of Earth Day. We will also have a poster contest where students can create a poster with a message using all natural or recycled materials.


 We are also creating a monthly newsletter that will contain articles on how we can live greener lifestyles. In our school newsletter, that is distributed every Tuesday, the Earth Savers is adding fast facts. We have also organized to have facts read over the intercom in the morning and afternoon. All of these facts will come from my website: <http://www.recyclingeducation.co.cc/>www.RecyclingEducation.co.cc. Students will visit my website in computer classes to learn even more. 


We would also like for an influential person or environmentalist to come to our school to talk to our 1st-8th graders. We would also like an influential person or environmentalist to read a book that we will supply to our younger children. It would also be great if you could pass my information along to others who can help me.


I was e-mailing you on behalf of my principal, Mrs. Brandis, the Earth Savers teacher coordinator, Mrs. Pasley, the Earth Savers vice president Abbey Brewster, and myself to ask you if you would come out to our school and support our Green Week Campaign.  Please e-mail me at <mailto:CharlesOrgbon@Recyclingeducation.org>CharlesOrgbon@Recyclingeducation.org if you are interested.


Thank You,


Charles OrgBon




P.S - I saw your speech at the EMILY's List event on C-SPAN. I thought you were a remarkable speaker and wanted to know if you could share the importance of being green to my school. We don't have any politicians in South Carolina who care for the environment and children as much as you do.

Thanks to your involvement in the TCC, our Lunch and Learn Series are always an enormous success!  We are starting off 2009 with the first Lunch and Learn that will feature the proposed Comprehensive Plan for the City of Raleigh. 

Please look over the form attached since we do have a new “level of sponsorship” this year and any support would be appreciated…including a donation for a door prize!   For more information on each level of sponsorship you may visit the TCC website at <http://www.tricc.org/EventSponsors.htm>http://www.tricc.org/EventSponsors.htm


Again, we are always grateful of your involvement and look forward to a great 2009!







Comprehending Raleigh’s Comprehensive Plan:

What Does the Plan Mean for Citizens and Businesses?



You’ve probably heard about the City of Raleigh’s proposed Comprehensive Plan.  Maybe you’ve read through the 400 page growth guide.  But do you really understand what it means? 



Do you own property---or a business---and want to learn how the plan will impact you?  Do you want to hear from private industry experts who’ve studied the draft and can shed light on the details, consequences and implications of the document?  Then don’t miss the TCC’s first lunch and learn of 2009!



Our forum features the best legal minds and experts in the Triangle:
Eric Braun of K&L Gates, and Lacy Reaves with Smith Anderson, et al.  Join Lacy and Eric as they pick through the plan, and discuss what it means for the average citizen.  Plus, TCC’s own Chris Sinclair will talk about the political implications of the plan---during an election year.  You will get answers to these questions and more:



* Does the plan promote balanced growth?
* Will the plan fundamentally shift how Raleigh grows?
* What are the political realities of proposed plan?

Governor Perdue,

     I am currently serving as Teacher Ambassador for Craven County
Schools.  This is my eleventh year teaching English at Havelock High
School, and I also taught eight years at New Bern High. With my two
years teaching at Croatan High School, I am currently completing my
twenty-first year of teaching. Although I am a representative for all
teachers in our county, I have not had the opportunity to share my
opinion and other teachers' opinions with key legislators regarding
important issues facing teachers in our county and other counties in
North Carolina. I hope that you will have time to meet with me because I
want to do my part and truly represent our county. I don't doubt that
you hear from teachers on a regular basis (especially when they are
upset about something), but the committee chose me because they said
they felt I possess the most integrity. I hope to be able to share some
thoughts and concerns as we move forward with the framework for change.
Thank you for your time.

Kim Bennett

Subject: Request Governor's Attendance

Comment: Greetings! My name is Jonathan Shores and I am the Director of Mount Olive College at RTP on Miami Blvd in Durham. I had the opportunity to assist with Gov. Purdue's inauguration as the Non Commissioned Officer in Charge of the Color Guard. (I am also a NC Guardsman) In my role as Director/Dean of Mount Olive College @ RTP I have the distinct pleasure of serving adult students who wish to complete their bachelor's degrees. One of the degrees we have is Early Childhood Education. At the beginning of each new cohort we start, I along with other school leaders have the opportunity to welcome the students to Mount Olive as we welcome them and talk about the importance of the career field they are choosing. I know that Early Childhood Education is a large platform for the governor and I would like to request her presence at our next cohort for those students who will be starting the degree of Early Childhood Education. I would love if she could spend 10-15 minutes to discuss her platform as well as encourage these students who are starting their bachelor's degree to serve the young children of this great state. The date of the cohort start is May 19, 2009 at 6:00pm. I know the governor's calendar fills up rather quickly but I was hoping to request her presence in advance. I would be happy to further discuss my request at the information below. Thanks so much for your help and I look forward to hearing from you soon. Sincerely, Jonathan E. Shores, Jr. Director, Mount Olive College @ RTP jshores@moc.edu 919-941-2970

Governor Perdue:



Congratulations and I wish you much success as our first women Governor!



I wanted to schedule time to discuss how The Hispanic Scholarship Fund is working to reduce the drop out rate while increasing the college pipeline among Latino students across the United States.  More importantly and closer to home, I wanted to discuss how we can collaborate to enhance your initiatives across the state of North Carolina to increase the pipeline by reducing financial barriers.  I plan to be in Raleigh February 23rd through February 25th and would like to take 30 minutes of your time to discuss this urgent matter. Please let me know if we can meet any of these days.



I thank you in advance for your time and express my appreciation for your dedication to serve as our Governor for the great state of North Carolina.   I look forward to meeting with you.

First Day of Change

Welcome to the email list for the Office of Governor Bev Perdue.  We hope that regular updates from the Office of the Governor will encourage you and the people of North Carolina to participate in our state government and will keep you better informed.

>  

> As the first order of business as Governor, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx> Bev Perdue today signed a series of change orders that will help make government operate with more transparency and efficiency.  In a ceremony at her office, Governor Perdue signed five orders:

> 1. Governor’s Task Force for the Development of an Endowment for Positive Gubernatorial Campaigns
-       Starts the process of changing the way gubernatorial campaigns are run by creating a task force to develop the framework for an endowment that will provide third-party funding and remove special interest money from gubernatorial elections.

> 1. Reforming the Department of Transportation
-       Will prohibit DOT Board members from voting on individual projects and changes the way DOT does business – putting more of the decision-making in the hands of professionals.

> 1. Open Book Government for North Carolina
-       Increases accountability and transparency by creating a searchable and public website that shows spending on grants and contracts.

> 1. On-Site and State-Stat Performance Management and Accountability
-       Governor Perdue will make regular, unannounced inspections of state facilities and will require departments to conduct statistical performance reviews of government programs.

> 1. Establishing the North Carolina Budget Reform and Accountability Commission (BRAC)
-       Citizen oversight panel will ensure government programs are using tax dollars in the most effective and efficient way possible.

>  
Additionally, Governor Perdue affirmed her commitment to participating in at least four live town halls.  She also officially launched an electric-town hall (<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/>eTownhall) to be maintained on her website in an effort to remain engaged with, and receive constructive feedback from, the public.

Subject: National Career and Technical Education Month

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, Knowing how busy you must be, but also knowing how pro-active you are; we would like to extend a cordial invitation to you from West Stanly High School (Career and Technical Education Department)any time at your convenience during the week of February 9 - 13 for "National Career and Technical Education Month". During this week, Career & Technical Education will be promoted through special activities, etc. Our teachers work so very hard and strongly believe in the importance of career and technical education combined with academics. Each day seems to be a struggle to ensure that our CTE programs are seen for the value that they offer; and that our programs will increase in number and not be overlooked or no longer offered. We strive for this each day; but especially during National CTE Week we push a little harder toward the goal. We are located in Stanly County - and should the opportunity be favorable for your attendance I will be glad to discuss any further details with you. Let me say on behalf of our CTE teachers and myself we appreciate any and all of your support for us. We know first-hand how valuable a Career and Technical Education can be - we would like for everyone else to know its value as well. I hope that you have a pleasant afternoon; thank you in advance for consideration of our invitation. Sincerely, Donna (Mabry-Furr) Career Development Coordinator, NBCT

To Bev Purdue,



I am an alumni of the University of Florida and the Young Alumni Chair for the alumni in the Triangle Area.  I am based out of Raleigh, NC and excited that we have a Gator in the Governor’s chair.  I have a request….I would like to have someone from the administration come and speak at a breakfast.



As the Young Alumni Coordinator I also network with other young and involved groups from around the triangle.  We are always looking for successful individuals to come and speak to us and share their experiences.  If this is at all possible I would be extremely grateful and so would Gator Nation.



If you have a young and involved coordinator, marketing toward those individuals under the age of 35 and students,  that you employ from your office I would enjoy meeting with him/her and discussing possible volunteer efforts/opportunities/programs.



I searched the governor’s site and emailed a few of the fellows that have anything to do with the youth office. I appreciate the time and look forward to your response.



CHEERS!

Subject: A request from the president of Southwest Virginia Community College



Dear Governor Purdue:



Hello from Southwest Virginia!



My name is Mark Estepp, and we have met once or twice, as I was a dean at Appalachian State University for many years.  Ken and Roseanne Peackock are old and dear friends of mine and Trish’s.  I am now the president of Southwest Virginia Community College, which allowed me to return to my roots in the coal fields of Virginia. 



I recollect when we talked once that you too are a coal miners child, growing up in Grundy.  We have recently built a beautiful new facility in Grundy, called the Booth Center, where we offer associate degrees.  King College and Bluefield College have recently come on board with us to offer that last two years of degrees in Nursing and Business Management there.  Who would have thought years ago, that you can get a complete four year degree in Grundy, not to mention a law degree or a pharmacy degree?



I am writing with a huge favor to ask of you.  Would you consider being our commencement speaker in May? It is Thursday May 14.  If you could do this, we could consider speaking with our educational colleagues at the Pharmacy School and the Law School in Grundy to see if you might speak at theirs as well. 



I know it is a lot to ask of a Governor, but as a local girl, I'm hoping to tug on your Grundy/Southwest Virginia heartstrings!



Thanks for considering this, and congratulations and good luck as Governor.



Mark Estepp

Dear Sir or Madam:



I would very much like to schedule a personal meeting with Governor Perdue. 



I have spoken with Governor Jim Holshouser, a personal friend of mine, about my situation and he suggested that I make an appointment and talk with Governor Perdue.



I can be brief and can also be very flexible with my schedule in order to meet with the Governor.  I live an hour and a quarter from Raleigh, near Pinehurst.



With sincere appreciation,

Zach, Courtney,

We write to request a short meeting with Governor Perdue regarding a major project in eastern NC that will create stable, agriculture technology jobs using a former textile manufacturing facility. If the Governor could spare time on Wednesday morning, it would be ideal since the entire project team is together and has other meetings in Raleigh. We met with Chief Justice Burley Mitchell and Governor Jim Hunt last week and Governor Hunt will be contacting your office on behalf of the project team as well.

The Collins and Aikman Facility, a 600,000 square foot facility, closed in 2005 and was so devastating to the community that the Town had to lay off 20% of its workforce. The Rural Economic Development Center developed the Building Renovation and Reuse Program as a result of this issue. We have met with the Rural Center and have the green light on the reuse grant.  

Not only will the project improve the social welfare of North Carolina's citizens, the United States Military (and eventually other at risk populations) through state-of-the-art Agriculture Technology developed with NCSU.  Farmville Foods will generate investment and stable jobs in manufacturing and agriculture, and provide a social infrastructure for job training, including the handicapped, that  will provide an economic engine for a an economically affected, tobacco-dependent town and region in North Carolina and spur spin-off economic effects throughout eastern North Carolina while using North Carolina commodities. Farmville Foods focuses on three priorities: agriculture, stable job creation and retention, workforce training. We think the applicability of this project to the mission of the Golden Leaf Foundation is an excellent match.


The building will be sub-divided into multiple synergistic operating entities:

1)      Food processing plant - State of the art plant using technology developed at NCSU that is already FDA approved

2)      Cold storage space – Large deficit in Eastern North Carolina

3)      Non-profit work center - Employ disabled citizens ( I will get some stats)

4)      Educational center – Partnership between Universities, Community College, and Hospital to provide workforce training and education on nutrition

5)      Location of three existing companies collaborating in this venture: Ultraseptics, Crabworks, and Mactree. Crabworks has existing contracts with the military.



The project ties together a benefit to the military, employment for more than 400 in the region, stable jobs and additional opportunities for expansion.

We look forward to meeting with Governor Perdue.

Warmest regards,
Jeanne Milliken Bonds

Subject: Graduation Speaker

Comment: Hello, I am writing as 5th grade level chair at Mel and Zora Rashkis Elementary school in Chapel Hill NC. Our school would consider it a great honor if Govenor Perdue would speak to our graduating 5th graders at their commencement ceremony on Friday morning, June 5th (specific time could be scheduled to best fit Gov. Perdue's schedule). Governor Perdue has some ties to Rashkis Elementary in that it serves in the neighborhood in which she lived in Chapel Hill. She visited our school when our current group of 5th graders were in kindergarten or 1st grade, and it would be wonderful for her to come back, now that she has been elected govenor. As a former educator herself, many of the children are inspired by her story. Our principal, Deshera Mack, also served on the State Board of Education with Gov. Perdue in 2007-2008, and was Principal of the Year for 2006-2007. This graduation is extra special because the current group of 5th graders is the first group to complete kindergarten through 5th grade at our school. Again, we would be honored if Gov. Perdue would consider being our commencement speaker for the program. (A 5-10 minute speech would be just fine). Thanks so much for the consideration and we look forward to hearing your response. We know Gov. Perdue's schedule is filling fast and she has many things on her plate, but we thought as a former educator and with the connections to our school, she might particularly enjoy this opportunity to inspire young minds. Thanks so much, Bradey Scott 5th Grade Team Leader Mel and Zora Rashkis Elementary 919-918-2160x22303

Comment: Good Morning, I am a teacher at Stoneville Elementary School. We are planning our Read Across America Day for March 2nd. We would like to invite Governor Perdue to read to our students on March 2nd. We would love to have her in person but are well aware of her committments. If she could read a Dr. Seuss book or one of her favorite childrens books and video tape it for us, we would be very grateful. She could send it to the above address by March 2nd. Our students would love to hear our Governor read to them. Sincerely, Margaret Halpin
