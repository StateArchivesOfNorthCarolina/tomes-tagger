Subject: Judge Ned Mangum and the Wells Homeschool Case

Comment: Governor Perdue, I have recently read about a case that Judge Mangum presided over in your state. The case involves the Wells family. As I understand it, a divorce led to a judgement by the dishonorable Judge Mangum to forceably take her children out of her educational care even though the children have apparently done well above average on state testing. I pray that you will do all you can to stop such a grave injustice. As I recall, you advertised yourself as a person strongly dedicated to better education for the youth of North Carolina during the elections. I trust that you will see fit to take a personal interest in this case and stand up for the rights of good parents in your great state. Maybe you have been elected for such an important time as this....Thank you and may God have his hand on your decisions. Sincerely, Kristen Sorensen

Comment: I am outraged at Venessa Mills' right to homeschool being taken away and the prejudicial orders of this judge, in case #08CVD17753. Judge Mangum's decision is a slap in the face of justice. Please do your part to correct this injustice that has taken place in my fine state of North Carolina!

Subject: Home Schooling Rights, Vanessa Mills and Judge Ned Mangum

Comment: Governor Perdue, I am deeply moved by the story of Vanessa Mills, a parent who is having her home schooling rights taken away by Judge Ned Mangum (case #08CVD17753). Can it really be this easy for a parent's rights to be taken away? Is there anything you can do to help Mrs. Mills? I do not understand why Judge Mangum would require public schooling for home school students who have tested 2 years above their public school peers. It makes no sense. Please help protect home schoolers' rights! Sincerely, Sandi Sanford Fuquay Varina, NC

Subject: Custody case #08CVD17753, Mills children

Comment: I am appalled at the recent court case in NC regarding the Mills children (who tested up to 2 grades ahead of their public school counterparts and are in no danger). Had their father not committed adultery and a divorce case not insued, this woman would have never been put in this position in the first place. She is being punished for her husband's infidelity. It can't be good for the children to not only be going through this divorce, but to also be torn from home and made to enter public school in the middle of it when all they have ever known is being at home with their caring and nurturing mother. It scares me to see that a judge thinks that he knows better than these children's own mother about what is best for them - and aims to strip her rights as a parent and American citizen just because he doesn't share her same belief system. This kind of thing is something out of Nazi Germany. I beg you to get involved and put a stop to this. If you are an American who believes in FREEDOM, please do not allow this judge to get away with hijacking this woman's children for his own purposes and taking away her rights. All the homeschoolers in Texas are watching this case closely.

Subject: HOmeschool Case in NC

Comment: I called your office about the NC homeschool case and was told there was nothing that you could do, and yet, Gov Schwarzenegger, had no trouble helping out for a homeschool case in CA. So, Governor Perdue, where is your voice for this wife and mother??? Does she deserve any less? Show us that you are an advocate for women! God bless, Gwen D'Amelio California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger blasted a court ruling that endangered homeschooling and homeschoolers statewide (CA). Here are some of the facts for the NC case: On Friday, March 6th 2009, North Carolina judge Ned Mangum presided over the case of Venessa Mills, and gave the following orders: 1. Three homeschooled children, who tested at grade level and two grades above, must be sent to public school. 2. The children's Christian beliefs, as taught by their mother, were to be deliberately "challenged" by their public education. 3. The children's mother was not given enough financial support to allow her to continue homeschooling, or even to adequately survive in the family home. 4. The children were burdened with a visitation schedule of equally divided time, while the mother temporarily continued to homeschool them, creating a completely unworkable and disruptive environment. 5. (The judge's intent from the beginning was to force these parents back together and out of his courtroom, acting like a liberal-biased marriage counselor instead of being a judge.) 6. The children's father, a confessed adulterer, was given freedom to stay at the family home indefinitely while continuing to play tennis with his mistress. His crime of adultery was rewarded, rather than censured. 7. The children's mother's conservative Christian beliefs were deliberately attacked and slandered by the opposing attorney, and she was accused of being brainwashed for simply upholding the truths of the Bible. 8. Despite a complete lack of evidence, she was punished with a mental health evaluation - while the judge deliberately exposed her to the continued emotional trauma of her adulterous husband living with her and her children. 9. The children's father was granted his request for the children to go to public school, the minimum level of financial support, and - with no official order to leave the home - was, in effect, given complete freedom to dictate property settlement and terms before moving out. 10. A home evaluation is to be carried out - most likely after the children's public school starts, and still in the midst of their parent's divorce, a disruptive visitation schedule, and their mother's financial hardship. The judge knows this is a recipe for failure, for which the mother will be blamed. This is a prima facie case of injustice and prejudice. It's not about conservatives versus liberals - we wouldn't even want liberals to be treated this way.

Subject: Please help protect parental rights...

Comment: I am writing today to express my opposition to the ruling in case number: 08CVD17753, involving Thomas and Venessa Mills. Judge Mangum has ruled against a mother's judgment in how her children should be raised and schooled. This mother was found to be a loving, nurturing mother who has done a wonderful job in home schooling her children for the past four years. Her children have repeatedly scored above their grade average, yet this judge feels that he needs to "challenge" her children's academic abilities by forcing her to send them to public school. The father of these children has admitted that she has done a good job of home schooling and is a good mother. The father is an admitted adulterer, who has torn apart their family. His request for their children to be sent to public school is being granted, while the mother who has only done what is best for her children is losing her rights. The mother's religious beliefs are also being attacked and has been ordered a mental health evaluation simply for teaching her kids God's Word, which was considered brainwashing. I thought in this country we had the right of religion and to teach our children our beliefs. She is also being forced to allow her husband to live at home, while he runs off with his mistress. I would ask that you please call for the removal of this judge from the case or make him offer a fair judgment for these children after carefully reviewing the facts. Thank you for your time, Kari Powell

Subject: Remove Judge Ned Mangum

Comment: Judge Mangum of Wake County should be removed from the bench for his recent ruling ordering home schoolers into the Government education system. This is a gross violation of Venessa Mills rights as parent and an insertion of the judges‚Äô personal and political views. This is clearly an abuse of power and an outrage to parents across this nation. I wonder how much money the NEA donated to Judge Mangums election campaign. This whole thing stinks and needs to be cleansed by the Judges removal. Your failure to act on this matter is also very troubling. On the other hand, you being a Demoncat this is all part and parcel of the Obamanation of America. The citizens of this country will be watching this case very closely.

Comment: I am not surprised by this judgement in the case#08CVD17753. What I am surprised by is the lack of freedom in how we choose to teach OUR children. This is a travesty and really needs to be reversed. Judge Mangum at the very least needs to remove this judgment, or be removed from his position. It is a sad day in our history when we as parents are forced to do what is opposite of what is best for our children. I thought that the family is supposed to be supported by our government, and yet we continue to come up against liberals forcing their opinions on us. This country is in dire need of representatives standing up FOR US and not FOR THEMSELVES and their next term. Please, do what our constitution states and help set this situation straight and set a precedent for future cases. Thank you! S. Nichols

Greetings Gov. Perdue,

I am writing in regard to orders given by Judge Ned Mangum in case number 08CVD17753 (Wake County, NC). Judge Mangum has given utterly unethical and blatantly prejudiced orders in this case and I am writing to ask that you help with the request that he be removed from the case. Among the facts of this case and the orders given were (summarized):

1. The Mills' three homeschooled children, who tested at grade level and†two grades above, must be sent to public school. Despite acknowledging that Ms. Mills had done a superior job in homeschooling her children, Judge Mangum wanted her teachings to be challenged - not scholastic teachings, but moral.

2. The children's Christian beliefs, as taught by their mother, were to be deliberately "challenged" by their public education. Despite having many outside the home activities, such as being on a swim team and having leadership roles in history club events, Judge Mangum thought they needed "socialization" because of their moral/religious beliefs.

3. The children's mother was not given enough financial support to allow her to continue homeschooling, or even to adequately survive in the family home.

4. The children were burdened with a visitation schedule of equally divided time, while the mother temporarily continued to homeschool them, creating a completely unworkable and disruptive environment.

5. The judge's intent from the beginning seemed to perspicuously clear to force these parents back together and out of his courtroom, acting like a liberal-biased marriage counselor instead of being a judge.

6. The children's father, a confessed adulterer, was given freedom to stay at the family home indefinitely while continuing to play tennis and rendezvous with his mistress. His crime of adultery was rewarded, rather than censured.

7. The children's mother's conservative Christian beliefs were deliberately attacked and slandered by the opposing attorney, and she was accused of being brainwashed for simply upholding what she believes to be the truths of the Bible.

8. Despite a complete lack of evidence, she was punished with a mental health evaluation - while the judge deliberately exposed her to the continued emotional trauma of her adulterous husband living with her and her children. Meanwhile, despite her husband's admitted deviant behavior, he was not ordered to have any mental evaluation.

9. The children's father was granted his purely spiteful request for the children to go to public school, the minimum level of financial support, and - with no official order to leave the home - was, in effect, given complete freedom to dictate property settlement and terms before moving out. This is unheard of.

10. A home evaluation is to be carried out - most likely†after the children's public school starts, and still in the midst of their parent's divorce, a disruptive visitation schedule, and their mother's financial hardship. The judge knows this is a recipe for failure, for which the mother will be blamed.

What Judge Ned Mangum has done, is stacked his orders so harshly against Ms. Mills, that she cannot maintain the excellent order and education in her home for her and her children. One cannot be sure why Judge Mangum has ruled with such prejudice and malice toward Ms. Mills and her children, but it is unacceptable. It is inconceivable that Judge Mangum would order the children out of homeschool and into the poorly performing, morally decrepit and even dangerous public school system, when the children have tested up to two grade levels higher and excel beyond the public school children. Judge Mangum's excuse that the children needed "socialization" is first most irrelevant because the children are very socially active outside the home, and is secondly beyond the scope of his authority. He has no authority to preside over any person's socialization choices. This case has been a blunder. It's so bad that some have wondered if money exchanged hands to achieve such an asinine and lopsided outcome. And so I ask that you do whatever is within your authority to have Judge Mangum be removed from this case, his orders rescinded and another more competent Judge preside over this case to assure a fair and unprejudiced judgment.

Thank you for hearing my concerns.

Sincerely and Respectfully Yours,
Jason D. Roberts

I am outraged to learn that Judge Ned W. Mangum has denied Ms. Mills the right to raise her children as she deems best.†† In his court ruling, case number: #08CVD17753, Judge Mangum claims the children should be enrolled in public school to counter the ideas they have been taught in the home.† This sounds more like the old Soviet Union than America.† What rights will we as parent lose next?† This Judge clearly has a bias against homeschoolers and an agenda of social engineering of his own.† Please put a stop to this abuse of power.

Comment: You can reference the case number: #08CVD17753 Wow! I had always heard that North Caroline was a wonderful place to homeschool your children. With judges like Judge Mangum decisions in this case, we may have to rethink our dreams of one day moving to your beautiful state. The children are obviously doing well with homeschooling. Having them evaluated when they lives are turned upside down by their parents divorce AND being thrown into school is simply not in the children's "best interest". This judge should be ashamed of using his bench to further his OWN personal beliefs!!! I hope there will be a LOT of news coverage of this! Simply outrageous!!!!!

Dear Madame Governor Perdue:



I am writing to you from the State of Washington and in regards to the horrendous ruling this so-called ìJudgeî passed down up Robyn Williams against her homeschooling her children. This ìJudgeî is overstepping his bounds in an obscene and ugly way, in effect imposing his own uber-liberal ideologies as they pertain that children should be forced into sub-par public schools where the so-called ìteachersî can impose and indoctrinate kids into their way of thinking, i.e., homosexuality is A-OK and youíre a racist if you donít embrace the homosexual way of life, that pre-teen sex is A-OK as well, with ìteachersî passing out condoms WITHOUT any input whatsoever from the parents who have the ultimate right to raise their children as they see fit, as long as the child in not endangered by physically or emotional abuse.



Judging by the overwhelming outpouring of support, I see this as untenable situation for you and your State. This will bring nothing but negative press and this story will not go away until Miss. Williams is allowed to teach and raise her kids the way she deems proper. Itís obvious that these two kids are so much farther ahead then their peers and one canít help but wonder if this is the real reason behind this travesty of personal rights ñ that the uber-liberals running this country canít tolerate the fact that their idea of public education is being proven to be far less superior than that of a homeschooled child. And this is what is so laughable about their stand on this matter; everyone already knows that our nations public school system has been co-opted so badly that it will take decades before our schools resemble something close to what they were like when I went, and to give you an idea as to how long ago that was, I graduated in May of 1980, not to mention that from the age of 15 until she retired at the age of 67, my grandmother taught kindergarten as well as my step-father was also a teacher, teaching all forms of music until he also retired some six years ago, so I know full well what Iím talking about.



Bottom line here, Madame Governor, is that this ìjudgmentî cannot be allowed to stand. Not only is it inherently wrong on myriad levels, it sets an ugly precedent. Do you really want your state, under your watch, to be forever known as the state that started the assault upon our very rights to raise our own children? Whatís to say that it wonít stop there? That somehow a ìJudgeî can now decide what a child should eat, wear, listen to, etc., is a frightening thought and one I hope to never see in my lifetime, or even the lifetime of my two year old niece, who incidentally will be entirely homeschooled and yet have an equally active social life where daily interaction with her peers will be the norm, not the exception, which by all accounts is what Ms. Williams has upheld in her ideals as to how best to raise her children.



In closing I want to make clear that while this ìJudgeî in particular is overstepping his bounds to the point where I seriously doubt his ability to render fair and unbiased decisions from the bench, I do not think that all Judges are as bad as Mr. Magnum is, nor do I deem all teachers to be nothing more than uber-liberal indoctrinators. I also realize that there are (at least I hope this to be true) far more good teachers then there are bad ones, but anymore Iím beginning to wonder if itís not really a toss-up, as it seems that everyday I read a story of a teacher gone horribly wrong.



Please, Governor Perdue. Please make the right decision here (not the politically correct decision) and stop Judge Ned Magnum from perverting and bastardizing this womanís God given right to raise her children as she sees fit and without all the politically correct garbage that the uber-left wing constituency sees fit to ram down our childrenís (and our own) collective throats.



With the utmost respect and warmest regards,



Michael Blankenship

NC Judge Orders Homeschool Mother to Put Kids in Public School
Contact: Adam Cothes, 253-797-6194, <mailto:acothes.publicity@gmail.com>acothes.publicity@gmail.com
RALEIGH, NC, Mar. 12 /<http://www.christiannewswire.com/>Christian Newswire/ -- Venessa Mills is fighting a legal battle for the heart and soul of homeschooling in North Carolina. As reported on World Net Daily, on Friday, March 6, Judge Ned W. Mangum stripped her of the right to homeschool, and ordered her three children to enter public school.

<http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=91397>http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=91397

Mills was forced to defend her right to homeschool during divorce proceedings brought on by her husband's unfaithfulness. Mr. Mills admitted, under oath, to repeatedly committing adultery. Even with abundant evidence showing the Mills children are well adjusted and well educated, Judge Mangum ruled overwhelmingly against Mrs. Mills on every point. He stated the children would do better in public school despite the fact that they are currently at or beyond their grade level. Evidence showed two children tested several grades ahead.

When issuing his verdict Judge Mangum stated his decision was not ideologically or religiously motivated. However, he told Mrs. Mills public school will "challenge the ideas you've taught them."

What has emerged is a picture of a clearly liberal judge imposing his beliefs and striking down traditional values. Mangum, a Democrat appointee, disregarded the facts of the case in favor of his own agenda. Such anti-conservative prejudice is increasingly legislated from the bench, and appears to be encouraged by the Democratic Obama administration.

Robyn Williams, friend and homeschool mother of four was present at the proceeding. "I have never seen such injustice and such a direct attack against homeschooling," said Williams. "This judge clearly took personal issue with Venessa's stance on education and faith, even though her children are doing great. If her right to homeschool can be taken away so easily, what will this mean for homeschoolers state wide, or even nationally?"

On March 24th lawmakers in North Carolina will be reminded of the sheer numbers of homeschoolers in their state. As students and their parents descend on the capitol, organizers of the Capital Fest 2009 field trip will show they have a voice in North Carolina legislation regarding education.

Williams is rallying homeschoolers from across the nation to fight back to defend their rights as Americans to educate their children. She feels the judge has been given a free hand to impose his personal opinions and needs to reexamine his decisions. Please subscribe to Robyn's blog and join the fight for protecting everyone's homeschool rights (<http://www.hsinjustice.com/>www.HSinjustice.com).

For more information or to schedule an interview contact Adam Cothes at <mailto:acothes.publicity@gmail.com>acothes.publicity@gmail.com or call 253-797-6194.

The public is being encouraged to take these action steps:
1. Forward this message to every person on your contact list, and all those interested in protecting basic American rights. After the right to educate is gone, property and other basic rights will follow.

2. Read the blog at <http://www.hsinjustice.com/>www.HSinjustice.com.

3. Contact three officials to express your outrage at Venessa Mills' right to homeschool being taken away and the prejudicial orders of this judge. Three or four short emails or phone calls could be the difference for these kids, and many more like them.

Comment: Dear Madame Governor Perdue, I'm sure you are very busy, but I believe this matter requires your urgent attention and action. Please review the facts of Venessa Mills' case, as presented on www.HSinjustice.com, and review the full official records for yourself. It is outrageous that Venessa Mills is being victimized by such contradictory, inconsistent, and unsupportable statements from the bench - on top of the precedent this sets for removing children from a thriving homeschool environment and placing them into public school. Unfortunately, we cannot simply wait for the "system" to fix this problem, because the system is what has broken down. Please make a quick phone call and rectify this abuse of the law. In the interest of justice, intervention is required to compel Judge Mangum to act in accordance with the evidence and with common sense. Otherwise, he should be removed from case number #08CVD17753 before any further damage is done. Our concern is also that this same situation does not happen again, and another mother (or father) is put through a similar ordeal. If Judge Mangum is not capable of impartially ascertaining facts and acting in a logical manner, his fitness to serve as a judge should be called into question. I do not have any grudge or ax to grind against good judges, good laws, or good attorneys - but rewarding the guilty and punishing the innocent is an abuse of justice by any standards.

Subject: Judge Ned Mangum Case #08CVD17753

Comment: Governor Perdue We are writing to you to share our firm disagreement with Judge Ned Mangum's ruling on case #08CVD17753. As I'm sure you are well aware now, Judge Mangum has pushed a personal agenda by ruling against the right to Home School and forcing the Mills children to Public School. We have an obvious case of above average children (in all areas) being forced to attend Public School for no apparent reason but the Judge's ruling of "supplementing" or "making them well-rounded". Please explain this ruling, how this is not an injustice and how this will not lead to further unexplainable rulings? Please do whatever you can in your power and stop this before it is too late. We need you to stand up for American rights and Freedoms! I would not be in disagreement with his ruling if there were hard evidence/proof of outright neglect for these children. So, how can I read anything into this but a personal agenda. This is not a case of a Judge using the Law to make a decision. Judge Mangum admits as much! These type of actions from our Judges is becoming the norm and we are going to lose everything we hold dear. Please take action, support the Constitutional rights of this family and also support our freedoms! Billy and Rebecca Shugart

There is a fifth-hand version of this being bandied about.

Let me see if I have it straight:

Some judge wants to force people who are successfully educating their children at home to send them instead to failing government schools.

Are you in a position to dock that judge's wages?

Subject: Case #08CVD17753 / Judge Mangum/ Mills' Right to Homeschool

Comment: As a homeschooling mother in NH I am outraged by Judge Mangum's arbitrary decision to revoke Vanessa Mills' right to homeschool her children based on his opinion that he wanted them to have "more well-rounded education" in a public school. His opinion does not trump parental rights. If this decision is allowed to stand then I fear that every homeschooler in every state will see this type of totally inappropriate judicial activism to strip parents of their rights to homeschool. Governor, I urge you, in the name of common sense and simple justice, to encourage Judge Mangum to reassess his position on ordering these thriving children into public school against their mother's wishes. If you need more information on the case, here is a news report link: http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=91397 Thank you for your time and attention.

Comment: Governor Perdue, I, along with thousands of other homeschoolers, are asking that you uphold justice by removing judge Ned Mangum from the recently publicized case concerning Vanessa Mills (Case #08CVD17753). Stripping parents of their right to decide what is best for their own children, and imposing a judge's convictions upon them, is unconscionable. Judge Mangum has no business imposing his views upon this, or any other, family. Again, please use the authority of your office to remove judge Mangum from this case. Thank you, Michelle Smith

Subject: Homeschooling in North Carolina

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am a former educator who taught in Florida for more than six years. When I moved to North Carolina, I made the decision to homeschool my children. It is the best decision I have made in my life. My children are learning at incredible gains and my family is close. My family chose to move to North Carolina because there are so many opportunities in homeschooling. This is why it saddens me to see a judge over step the rights of a parent and force children into school. I am talking about the case in Wake County: The provisional court order from Judge Mangum. The order is incorrect and something needs to be done. The judge's personal agenda can clearly be seen to override the facts. What you'll see here is not a judge dispensing fair and balanced decisions in the best interests of children and parents, but a judge playing at marriage counsellor and dispensing emotional torture to an acknowledged "good" mother and homeschooler. As a voter in this state, I would hope you help this mother out whose rights are being taken away.

Subject: Judge Ned W. Mangum

Comment: I would like to express my surprise and disappointment over the resent verdict handed down by Judge Ned W. Mangum as he stripped Vanessa Mills of her parental right to homeschool her children. These children were testing above grade in their homeschool. Yet Judge Mangum says they will be better educated in Public School. This is not his decision to make. The state does not have the right too intervene in a family unless there is severe neglect or abuse. It is clear that this family had neither. Homeschooling is legal in North Carolina. Children who are homeschooled have shown over and over again that they test above their public school piers. The scariest aspect of this verdict is that the Judicial system of North Carolina is intruding into the parental rights of a family unjustly. Through out the history of our nation and state, parental rights have been treated as a constitutional right. I think that the Governor's office should look into this matter.

Subject: NC Judge orders homeschool family to public school

Comment: Thank you for serving the families of North Carolina as our Governor. We appreciate your commitment to our state and nation. I am a mother of three, two girls at Reagan High, and a 6th grader who is homeschooled. Though all of my kids have been homeschooled for at least a few years, I feel like my background has more than qualified me to do this as I have a B.A. in Education from The College of William and Mary and have been certified to teach in VA. Though my husband and I obviously do not have any particular problems with public education (obviously, since we have two kids there now), we wanted to insure quality education and values while they were young and felt that these would best be instilled at home. In addition, two of my kids have attention deficit issues, and a quiet home environment has provided a better environment for learning than a classroom full of distractions. My husband and I recently received information about case #08CVD17753 in Wake County, where Judge Mangum denied Vanessa Mills her right to homeschool. All of her children have tested at or above their grade level and are involved in many activities outside the home. Clearly, the well-being of the children was not what motivated this judge‚Äôs ruling. It appears that he was using the bench to litigate his own ideological standards. We believe he has overstepped his authority by stripping this mother of her freedom to choose what is best for her children. I don‚Äôt know how you as governor can step into this situation which falls under the judicial branch. However, I‚Äôm sure that the ripples of this ruling will reach our state House and Senate eventually. I ask your help in defending homeschool families. The freedom of families to choose what is best for their children needs to be protected. North Carolina is a strong center of homeschooling in our nation. If you feel that you need any information about homeschooling in our state, I will be happy to lend any help I can. Thank you for listening to a concerned mother.

Subject: Homeschooling and judge's decision

Comment: I do not know who to go to and voice my incredulity. Today, while reading the newspaper, I found that Judge Ned Mangum had some pretty ridiculous comments to make about the quality of public schooling! While I have three daughters who HAVE graduated from the Wake County public school system, I would NEVER say that this was superior to home schooling! Judge Ned Mangum needs to send a teenage spy into the school system and see what it is like today. Sex games are RAMPANT with the 13 and older set. Alcohol is a given. My daughters and I navigated the teen years together; can you imagine telling a divorced mom (whose husband had an affair...himself unable to turn down what was not best for his family) that it was now LAW for her to send her children to this arena (public school system)? I am not saying homeschooling is the only answer...just that public schooling is NOT necessarily the "real world" that I actually WANT my children exposed to. Judge Mangum is revealing a bias that he does not know all the facts about. I do not know Vanessa Mills. Should her children be "ordered" to attend public school, it should be for a reason other than 'being made stronger due to what they are exposed to'. You are the Governor; isn't there something you can do or say about this? Sincerely, Cathy Berger

Dear Governor Perdue,



North Carolina is held up in high regards nationally for its home-schooling program. †Parental rights are well established and the home-schooling community has thrived.† In the face of these results, Judge Ned Mangum has made an off the cuff ruling to take kids out of a thriving home and put them in our public schools. †According to all reports, the kids are at or above their appropriate grade level in their studies, emotionally stable, and healthy. †If that is the case, what gives the judge the right to take them out of this situation? †It defies logic or common sense.† We have a known situation with a positive outcome, and now he wants to force them into an unknown situation? †This is poor decision making at best, and outright tyranny at worst. †



As you know, the U.S. legal system is based on precedence.† If this decision is allowed to stand, judges across the nation will be given the green light to take healthy home-schooled children from their parents and placed into the public school system. †Please do whatever you can to reverse this ruling.† The final ruling is not signed.† It is not too late. †Please make your voice heard. †



I would have copied the judge on this email, but his office is not taking calls or emails on this matter.† I called this morning to express my displeasure, but apparently they are refusing to hear from us taxpayers.† They will only take letters.† By the time the letter gets there, the decision could be signed.† Please help.† Judge Mangums office phone has been re-routed to a call screener at (919) 792-4800



Respectfully submitted,

Subject: Home School ruling in Wake County

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I write you today as a concerned citizen and father of homeschooled children. I read today about a recent ruling in Wake County where the 3 children of Vanessa Mills are being forced out of homeschooling into public schools simply because the judge feels that a Christian-based education is a "problem." (See online via: http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/4727161/)Governor, the law has upheld the right to homeschool time and time again. I am absolutly perplexed as to what law the judge interpreted that caused this ruling against the rights of parents to provide a thorough education on their own, without state assistance. In the story I read, these children are all testing 2 grade levels above their peers. How many public schools can make that claim? Governor, I ask you as a concerned American to ensure that the laws defending the right to homeschool are not thwarted by an individual judge's personal opinion. Thanks for your time. Very Respectfully, Chase Spears

Comment: Dear Governor, I thank you for serving our wonderful state. I want to add my voice in asking that you would look into a case of NC Judge Mangum ordering Vanessa Mills to send her children to public school. The Mills family is going through a divorce due to the husbands unfaithfulness. Vanessa has met state requirements to homeschool and the kids have tested at or above grade level. It appears the judge has an agenda that is different than the state of NC which is why I ask you to look into the matter. Amy Kate Budd

I am yet another American voice out here expressing my outrage at Judge Mangum's ruling on the Mills case in reference to ordering her homeschooled children into public school. We, including custodial parents, have the right to choose our children's †education.. And the fact that these children have been homeschooled for 4 years with the father's approval and are not only thriving but are above grade level speaks for itself. My motto is "if it aint broke don't fix it". So why is the judge "fixing" things????
It is a clear LACK of judgement and he has made a grave error. This judge will bring on a huge controversey into his arena and the outcome will not show him in a positive light. This may ruin his career and I Hope it does. He has overstepped the boundaries of the law. And he obviously has no regard for the children's best interest. Is he not familiar with previous case law referencing homeschooling? Is he not familiar with the Home Schooling Legal Defense Association? Is he not familiar with state law? The father had NO leg to stand on but yet the judge manufactured one! This is akin to ordering a public school kid to be homeschooled!!† Its absurd!!!!

Subject: North Carolina case number is 08CVD17753 - Venessa Mills' case

Comment: I'm sure you are very busy, but I believe this matter requires your urgent attention and action. Please review the facts of Venessa Mills' case, as presented on www.HSinjustice.com, and review the full official records for yourself. My wife and I home-schooled our son from the 7th through the 12th grades. He always made well above his grade level on state tests and there is NO lack of socialization. "Socialization" has been used many times to make cases for forcing homeschool parents to put their children into public schools. In point of fact home schooled children are more often better socialized than public schooled children. This was shown by actual psychological testing several years back. It is outrageous that Venessa Mills is being victimized by such contradictory, inconsistent, and unsupportable statements from the bench - on top of the precedent this sets for removing children from a thriving homeschool environment and placing them into public school. In the interest of justice, intervention is required to compel Judge Mangum to act in accordance with the evidence and with common sense. Otherwise, he should be removed from case number #08CVD17753 before any further damage is done. Our concern is also that this same situation does not happen again, and another mother (or father) is put through a similar ordeal. If Judge Mangum is not capable of impartially ascertaining facts and acting in a logical manner, his fitness to serve as a judge should be called into question. I look forward to hearing that you have taken this matter to heart and done what is right. Thank you,

Comment: I do not agree with Judge Mangum forcing Vanessa Mill's children into our failing public school system. The children are currently performing well above grade level in thier homeschool. Judge Mangum is violating her 2nd amendment right to freedom of religion in the process. Judge Mangum should be focusing on custody issues, alimony and child support versus his individual opinion of someone's religious freedom and parental rights. How the children are educated should be decided by the parent who possesses primary custody of the children and this should be Vanessa, despite the degradation she must endure of a mental status evaluation as well as her husband committing adultry.

Dear Governor,

I am urging you to intervene in the tragic court case involving Mrs. Mills and her homeschooled children
who were ordered to attend public school by the biased, activist bigoted Judge.
The Mills children tested 2 yrs. ahead of their public school peers, yet, this unlawful, ignorant
judge has stepped on their rights to act as the social engineer by deciding they should get a "better
rounded" education.  ROUND IT OUT by exposing them to illegal drugs, school violence, illicit sexual
abuse by teachers or maybe provide an opportunity for another "teen pregnancy", rampant narcissism
and irresponsibility as it is encouraged by the "public engineers" in the school system ?!!!
I taught school in the state of Washington for 18 yrs. and have supported and encouraged my 2 sons
to homeschool their children because I have witnessed up close and personally how very UNdesirable and
destructive to young impressionable children the public system has become.
I completely understand why homeschooling is growing nationally at a tremendous rate.
Please compel your court system to provide a wise and unbiased / unbigoted judge in the Mills case;
some young lives are counting on that.

Respectfully,

Susan Gibson

Comment: Governor Perdue This case is outrageous. This is exactly what you get from an education in the "REAL WORLD" - stupidity and no common sense. I honestly can't believe this Judge. There is nothing that this Judge has ruled that makes any sense whatsoever. For the Judge to say, the children should be exposed to the "real world" - the real world of drugs in school, violence, disrespect for teachers, failing grades, provocative clothing??? That's the real world in our public schools today. You have got to be joking! Let's put the children in Columbine and watch them get blown up by some deranged kid. That will be a great "real world" experience. That judge shows more concern for his dog than he does for the children. What is he thinking? He must be on drugs or he's being paid off, or he's totally lost control of his brain. Is anybody thinking anymore? Common sense is just not common anymore. The Father is using the children as a weapon against their Mother and the Judge is feeding him the tools. How disgraceful to use those children in their marriage war. Those children did nothing to deserve this outrageous abuse by the Father and then again by the court. Please get the Judge some help and get another Judge to hear this case.

I do not have any grudge or ax to grind against good judges, good laws, or good attorneys - but rewarding the guilty and punishing the innocent is an abuse of justice by any standards. Many people will be watching to see what action you choose to take. Thank You for your time, Mrs. Kelly F. Kerley

Subject: Case #08CVD17753

Comment: This letter is in response to case number: #08CVD17753. I am very disappointed to hear about Venessa Mills' right to homeschool being taken away even with abundant evidence showing her children are well adjusted and well educated. These orders of Judge Mangum seem to show prejudice. I would like to see someone protect our basic American rights.Sincerely,Cheryl Barkman

Subject: Judge Ned W. Mangum

Comment: I am writing to protest Venessa Mills' right to homeschool being taken away by the prejudicial orders of Judge Ned W. Mangum. This matter had little bearing on the divorce proceedings in which Mrs. Mills was engaged and appears to be ideologically motivated and an affront to Mrs. Mills' civil liberties.

Subject: Case #08CVD17753

Comment: My family is a home school family and I am outraged that this judge has the right to deny Venessa Mills' right to homeschool her children. This right is protected by our constitution and judges are bound by it just as we are. He has overstepped his authority. I am concerned for my family and the other homeschool familys across the state. There are over 40,000 homeschool families in NC and this one ruling puts us all in danger. Please do something to protect us and our constitution right to homeschool. Thank you.

Subject: Judge Ned Magnum's decision regarding Venessa Mills & her children

Comment: I may not be a North Carolina resident, but I humbly ask that you hear me out anyway. Please speak out against the blatant injustice upheld by Judge Magnum, who admits he believes he knows better than the children's own mother what is best for them. How can anyone argue that it is in the best interests of the children to be uprooted from a homeschool environment that by all accounts has served them well, and forced into a public school environment at the same time their home life is undergoing dramatic change? Who in their right mind can think that these children will be better off with MORE stress and MORE upheaval in their lives? Please, come to the defense of these children and speak out against this injustice! Thank you.
