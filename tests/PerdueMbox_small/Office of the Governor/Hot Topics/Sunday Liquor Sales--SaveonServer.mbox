Subject: Sunday Alcohol Sales

Comment: I'm disappointed that Sunday alcohol sales would even be considered. I suspect that evryone who wants to drink alcohol on Sunday already has it on Saturday, and the small amount of increased sales would probably not make up for the additional expense of staffing the stores on Sunday. Our state would be much better served by reducing expenses such as the current two different organizations to oversee the schools, the multiple governor's offices, and the numerous examples of wasteful spending.

Subject: Alcohol Sales on Sunday

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue, I understand that the job you have to do in times such as these is difficult and our state is trying to find ways to increase cashflow. Sunday alcohol sales is not the only way. There are others, they are just harder and uncomfortable. I voted for you. I believe in you. I don't believe in this proposed action. To get money in this manner will not, in the long run, prosper our state. Our great state. It makes me feel so ashamed and sad to see the level to which we would lower ourselves. Look further. Please don't do this! Sincerely, Karen Atwater 1 Tim. 6:10 ...the LOVE of MONEY is the root of ALL KINDS of evil... Psa. 33:12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord.

Subject: The sell of Alcoholic Beverage On Sunday.NO!

Comment: Dear Governor Bev Perdue You have the nerve too sit there and call it a sin tax. Then you turn around and want to sell it on Sunday for more money for the state of NC. For every bad decision North Carolina State law-makers make there will be a consequence too pay in the long run. I want too believe that our North Carolina State Government has a conscience somewhere... This economic mess happen because the Federal and State Government levels were sleeping on the job where did Common Sense go with our politicians, and both political parties. Our level's of Government has drop the ball this time... Insanity is doing the same stupid thing over and over again and expecting a different results... I have too ask it again where did Common Sense go for our politicians? If you do this there will be a need for more: 1.Police- on call. 2.Police-For DUI and wreck with death's. 3.Police-For Shootings in the street. 4.Police For Break-in's and robbery's for business. 5.Police For Domestic violence against women and children. 6.Police For Gangs 7.Crime will go up for North Carolinian.... Please rethink your decision on the sell of Alcoholic Beverages on Sunday you saw the rewards but not the risks of more crime in North Carolina. It sure is bad enough now are you willing too make it worst. This is not the change we were looking for in North Carolina when we voted. Thank you Brendett Miles Lilesville NC

Subject: ABC Store

Comment: I was watching the news last night and heard that Bev Perdue is wanting the abc store to be open on Sundays. I think this is wrong, to me there should be NO alcohol sold anywhere on Sunday just like Myrtle Beach. She wants to raise taxes on cigareetes and if she keeps doing it to much it will put people out of work even more. If she worried about money why doesn't she take a cut in pay or make people of the high class take a cut in pay because the low class people are struggleing pay check to pay check to barley survive. We need to figure out a way to help better with jobs. I just feel like some of the things she wants to do is wrong. The Government wants to keep worrying about cigarrettes when you need to get the drugs off the streets, that's ten times worse than cigarretts. I wanted to voice my opinion and ask why....

Subject: ABC stores open on Sunday.

Comment: Much opposition has shown it's face with the recent media coverage of the ABC proposal which will open stores on Sundays. I am in favor of this proposal, though I am not a drinker. It is unconstitutional to band beverage sales on Sunday. The only argument that the opposition has is based on religious beliefs, and the Constitution plainly states that we CANNOT pass a law in regard to ANY religion. Our ancestors came here for this freedom, and as far as I know the Bush administration did not revoke that right. If we keep getting our state/federal legislation mixed in with Christianity, or any other religion for that matter, we will be in a bad situation. We learn our history to avoid repeating the same mistakes, wouldn't you agree? I gladly voted for you, and President Obama, because we need change. I think that it is due time that we start putting that talk into action. I support you fully. Please make my rights heard, and more importantly, respected like our Constitution so demands.

Subject: Sunday liquor sales

Comment: I am extremely against the proposal of opening the ABC stores on Sunday and so is everyone else I talk to about this. NC has always been a religious state and it should stay that way. We have alcoholic drinks in our house, but if we neglect to purchase it before Sunday, we do without. If you are aware of all the teenage drinking going on in our state, then you probably would not agreed to such a law. So many of our young people are drinking just about every day, but they can't get it on Sunday. You need to be looking at that problem and look for other ways to increase the state's income. Perhaps honoring Sunday would do more for the state than desecrating it. Please re-think your proposal!

Subject: Allowing the sales of liquior on Sunday

Comment: I know that everything is looking really bad. But do you believe in God?The first words are In the beginning is God. He said , all we had to do is ask, And God says he will supply our needs. Do you honestly believe , that should be done, on Sunday? Honestly , I wish I hadn,t voted for you. Maybe you weren,t raised in a liquior filled atmosphere. Do you realize that Sunday is Gods Day. Think about the violence , as well as everything else , deaths too , because of alcohol. I hope you will think seriously about it, knowing you are putting a lot of peoples lives at risk. It,s bad enough at any other time. Thank you , for your answer to this. Oh and also why do you need an office in Charlotte? Think about the money , spent to rent that office. Stop the pork waste.Think about what that money could be spent on.

Kudos to Senator Rand for spearheading the legislation that would permit the sale of alcohol (ABC Stores) on Sunday.  Yet another fine attempt to invoke the separation of Church and State.   The sooner the power structure in this state and nation realize that the Church is not GOD - nor is Jesus of Nazareth, the better off we're all going to be!

Subject: Opening ABC Stores on Sunday

Comment: We totally disagree with the proposal to open ABC stores on Sunday. It will cost more money to have them open and will probably cost more people's lives that will be drinking and driving. It's bad enough that they are open during the week. We don't need them open on the Lord's Day. You need to run the government more efficiently then you wouldn't be so desperate for money.
