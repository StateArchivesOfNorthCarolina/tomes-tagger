Subject: Taking 50 Million from Education Lottery

Comment: This just takes the cake in what our wonderful government will do to us. We pay tax on our income, then we pay tax on what we buy,we pay tax on food for Christs sake, we pay tax on all our bills. Now you want to rob us some more. We as Americans put the money in the lottery for schools while if we are lucky we can win something you can tax again. I guess education is not important to you since you are willing to take from lottery money. This money is to fund schools not line your pockets or state employee pockets. 100 million from Clean Water Fund, 50 million Public School Building, and 50 million Public School Textbook Fund. You need to make some more cuts in your budget.Sorry you can't manage your budget Governor maybe you should call it a day. I look at all the cars you state people drive up and down the roads, I know several people that work for the state and the luncheons you hold that tax payers pay for, you get raises, your time off meaning vacation and sick time I wish I got that kind of time paid to me so quickly. I am sure there is a lot of spending that is uncalled for but can be covered up in some fashion. Oh and by the way I didn't vote for you. Now all the people that did can rejoice in the fact that you can take lottery money, what a disgrace you are. Rob from the schools Bev. the hell with education. What we will have after your reign of terror? I guess we don't need to invest in clean water, school buildings or God forbid textbooks you go Bev balance your budget girl do whatever it takes at any cost. Maybe the people that put you in office will have deep regrets. I just read this on WRAL site and I am sick that you would do this being a woman you could find other ways but you have stuck it to us real good. Rob peter to pay Paul Bev and how do you plan on paying this all back. MORE TAXES NO DOUBT FOR US TO PAY. AMERICANS LOVE TAXES BEV PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE GIVE US SOME MORE TO PAY WE ALREADY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT AFTER PAYING TAXES AS IT IS SO PLEASE TAKE SOME MORE AND I HOPE WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR OR LAY YOUR HEAD DOWN TO SLEEP THAT IT IS PEACEFUL FOR YOU DEAR BEVERLY PERDUE....THANK YOU SO MUCH.....GREED IS WHAT AMERICA IS ALL ABOUT...

Subject: school funding - FY2009

Comment: Funding for education should not be touch because schools are in desperate need for it. It should be the last option, I am sure that funding from other sources could be utilize instead of hurting our childrens education, which is already in need for change. We voted for you because we believe that our childrens education was and is a priority in the state of North Carolina, please do not disappoint us. I rather pay a little more taxes than see education suffer. TMANN.

Subject: lottery funds

Comment: I read an article on the internet that you are planning on using funds generated by the lottery to ‚Äúbalance the state budget‚Äù. Is this true? I was under the impression that when this lottery was rushed through the system that all the funds were to go toward education. Even though I did not support the lottery, I think it is unconscionable that even one penny is NOT used for the intended purpose, education. If there are funds that are not being used, (I find this completely unlikely considering the buildings that have been put on hold due to shortage of funds,) it should be set aside for future use in the area of education. I did not support the lottery proposal because I have seen this system fail in Tennessee and Florida. It seemed that the leaders were not ethical enough to keep their hands off the funds and they would either strip the general budget of any education funds or they would dip in to it, as you are intending to do, to make things better for their bottom line. The sate of the education system in North Carolina is dismal and if there is money left over from the lottery, it is a testament to the math that the leaders of the state used to devise the spending.

Subject: NC Education Lottery Funds

Comment: Do you find it as distasteful as I do that politicians make campaign promises to get votes and then forget them when they get in office and need the money? The lottery was sold as a means to benefit education, not to supplement poor budget planning by elected politicians. Go back and look at your campaign promises to keep the NC Education lottery just that -EDUCATION. You're going to get my taxes with Obama's handing it out and my children and grand children will be paying for it in the rest of their lives. Hurry for Socialism. Should we expect an increase in gas taxes, drive by the mile taxes, how about a sales tax increase, how about higher tax rates on small business, how about greater "sin" taxes - Cigarettes, Alcohol - how about reducing deductions for charaity, the list goes on and on and on.........

Subject: Diverting lottery money from education

Comment: I think your decision to divert lottery money from education is wrong. The schools in this state aren't just being squeezed they are being choked. Our children deserve better. You are still advertising it as the Education lottery, on TV , in stores and on the tickets themselves. I think that is fradulent. If its going to now be the North Carolina bail out lottery than call it that. I know times are tight but who is more important than our children? Mine are grown and no longer in the schools, and yes I am a teacher but in a charter school so I don't benefit from lottery money and I still think it is an unbelievably unfair move on your part. Why not tax the tickets? Use that money for whatever we need and give the ticket revenues back to our children where it belongs.

Subject: Lottery Funds for Schools?

Comment: Dear Governor, I am surprised, I think, that you would take money from the lottery fund as I was led to believe this would not happen by most politicians. Blame it on what you will, but I have no faith that your team will be any different than the previous. I know information exist that I am unable to see, but this is a slap in the face to the voters of NC. Is the state attorneys fund unavailble, (yes), for your money gathering. Please, for once, give NC a straight, decent politician that cares about NC and her people. Jim Black, Easley in limos, and school lottery money being used for pet projects. Why do I continue to believe that any of you guys/gals are different. Good luck with this job. NC needs strong, trustworthy leadership and no more cross-talk. This lottery, which I supported but do not play, is a sham that was sold to us by liars and is not being used as promised. I am not surprised, I just hoped for more from this administration. God bless NC and these people who are spending our money. The picture on the website of Bev and the school children should be changed. It just does not fit with her actions.

Comment: The lottery was voted in to support schools not to support the stupid wasteful projects of the people who are supposed to represent us. Using lottery money to balance the budget is a breach of contract and illegal. Governor Perdue is bound by the conditions listed before the lottery vote. Maybe she should cut out the unnecessary trips by our elected officials, their spouses, and their staff. A cut of 50% of the staff of these officials would help. Keeping election promises, not stealing money committed to schools is a better plan. Do not CRAP ON our children! Larry Abernathy

You know it is wrong of you to take it for any other reason. I understand the economy is bad,and that you are trying to put together a budget. The facts of this are simple, either raise taxes or cut spending. That is what we elected you for. Make the tough decisions and stop taking money that is suppose to be used for our children.

Comment: You are making a big mistake if you take lottery funds to use for the general budget. Many of us who supported the lottery did so only on the promise that these funds were for EDUCATION only. Why is it that when budgets have to be cut, that education seems to be the first place attacked? Education should be the LAST place cut and that includes use of lottery funds. These should never be used for anything other than education.

How does the teaher's pay stack up alond side of the rest of the states. Why does the schools around my house have huts everywhere. I don't understand the lottery thing. Since it no longer totally stands for education, I think you need to vote on it again or rename it.

Subject: Taking money dedicated to the schools from the lottery.

Comment: YOU RESCENDED ONE OR MORE OF YOUR PROMISES TO THE PEOPLE OF NC. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU PROMISED TO USE THE LOTTERY MONEY TO IMPROVE SCHOOLS IN NC. YOU EVEN HAD A MEETING WITH SCHOOL OFFICIALS AND TEACHERS AND SCHOOL PRINCIPALS OF HOW IMPORTANT TEACHERS ASSISTANTS WERE VALUABLE AND NEEDED FOR THE CLASSROOMS. THEN YOU TURN AROUND AND STEAL MONEY FROM THE LOTTERY WHICH WAS MEANT FOR SCHOOLS AND USE IT AS YOU WANT. THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SEND THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL THAT SPEAK NO ENGLISH, GET FREE LUNCHES, NO PENCILS OR PAPER, WHILE WEARING DESIGNER CLOTHES. YOUR DECISION TO USE THE SCHOOLS MONEY IS AN INTEGRITY ISSUE. IF A PERSON LIES TO ME ONCE THEN I THINK THAT MAYBE THEY JUST MADE A MISTAKE, BUT WHEN I'M LIED TO TWICE THEN I CAN NEVER TRUST THEM AGAIN. IT IS AN INTEGRITY ISSUE. DID YOU NOT RENIG ON YOUR PROMISES? CUT SOME OF THE FAT IN RALEIGH TO START WITH. PUT SOME OF YOUR STAFF ON A 4 DAY WORK WEEK WITH A PAY CUT FOR THE DAY THEY WERE OFF. IT APPEARS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE LIKE THE LAST GOVERNOR THAT WE HAD. SPENDING MONEY FOR HIS PERSONAL PERKS AND FOR ALL HIS FRIENDS. YOU ARE STARTING OFF LIKE HE DID. ONE MORE THING, IS CUTTING TEACHER ASSISTANT JOBS BY SENIORITY RATHER THAN QUALIFICATIONE. THAT IS A LOUSY WAY OF SEPARATING THE GOOD FROM THE BAD. MANY TEACHERS AND ASSISTANTS USE THEIR OWN MONEY FOR THING USED IN HIS CLASSROOM BECAUSE OF BUDJET CUTS, WHEN THE MONEY IS {WAS} THERE IN THE LOTTERY FOR SUCH THINGS. THE PTO HAS TO HAVE FUND RAISERS TO HELP SUPPORT THE SCHOOLS. WHAT A SHAME. I CAN'T FATHOM WHAT YOU DID AND YOU USED TO BE A FORMER TEACHER. MOST ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE VERY WEALTHY AND DON'T HAVE A CLUE HOW THE POOR NORTH CAROLINANIONS LIVE. MOST HAVE NEVER ACTUALLY WORKED PHYSICALLY A DAY IN HIS LIFE AND HAS BEEN HANDED MONEY DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU THAT YOU CANT BELIEVE POLITIANS IN WASHINGTON AND IN OUR OWN STATE. THAT IS MY STORY AND I'M STICKING TO IT.

Subject: raiding our education lottery fund

Comment: I want to protest the raiding of New Hanover County's education fund which is funded by the NORTH CAROLINA EDUCATION LOTTERY. Please re-read the name of the fund and why it was voted into effect by the citizens of North Carolina. This fund was intended by the voters to finance our education needs and absolutely should not be raided by the State of North Carolina.

Subject: Lottery

Comment: Please tell me Governor Perdue that you are not taking $88 million from the EDUCATIONAL Lottery and using it somewhere else. If this is true, not a good way to start off your term. If you are doing this, please tell me what it is you plan on doing with that money. The lottery fund was helping build a BRAND NEW school in my area and helping to upgrade another. These projects have been told they are not going to be getting a lottery fund check for at least a month. This is after the lottery fund was budgeted. I hope if this money that you are being alleged to take from the EDUCATIONAL LOTTERY fund, may benefit those of us in the WESTERN part of the state. I would also like to know how the stimulus money from the Federal Government is going to benefit the WESTERN part of the state when you have taken up to $64 million for your home town of New Bern. With all due respect A very concerned NC citizen, David Eckard I look forward to hearing your responses.

Subject: Stealing from Education

Comment: Sure, let's take the funds we lied to our children about being for their education and blow it like we've blown all of the other money taken in taxes. It's not like it would be spent wisely on education anyway. And, it's not like we're the absolute last in the nation in education, right? What are we, 47 out of 50? Makes perfect sense, not.

Subject: Complaint on the action taken by governor perdue, to spend lottery money on state bills

Comment: As a retailer in the state of N.C. and also a daughter of a tobacco farmer, I feel that governor perdue, is not out for the best interest of the blue collar working class man of N.C. I feel as a very prosperous young small business owner, who sells hundreds of thousands of dollars in lottery a year, needs to get together with other small business owners to boycott the lottery. We also need to refuse to pay our over taxing government, taxes that our gouging to our businesses. So, I'm writing Mrs. Perdue to see what she wants to do about her lies and her over taxing. I' am sick and tired of crooks in the government. In my eyes I feel I need some kind of explanation of where my lottery money is going or I' am taking it out of my retail store, and talk other store owners to do the same. We are also waiting for our buyout. Not only are our sales down 25 percent, my father also lost his poultry and tobacco contract all this year. We will never see our buyout though, b/c we are a blue collar working american that's not connected with wall street. I need some answers quickly or the lottery is history.

Comment: I am sending this to express my extreme displeasure in your decession to cut off lottery funds to the schools to pay for other budget problems!! When your party pushed the lottery bill thru we were told the money would be used for education funding and education funding only! If the funds are not going to be used for education as was the expressed reason we were given for passing it, (I do not oppose the lottery but I do have a problem with the way it was forced on those who do) then the lottery should be dismantled.

Subject: Taking $100M from Education Lottery for Emergency Fund

Comment: This action is absolutely the worse thing that could have befallen this state's education system. This state's education program, especially elementary and secondary, is one of the worst in the country. Now, you steal money from it to pay off your cronies' programs. And this is after you divert money from the education budget, dollar for dollar, because of the Education Lottery. Due to this action, I expect to put all my volunteer energy into seeing you don't get reelected, and I've never done any political volunteering before.

Where is all this so called money from the lottery going? Shouldn't it go towards issues such as this? I am confused on why NC is having this problem currently. Why have the lottery if it‚Äôs not going to save teachers jobs and benefit the students. I really wasn‚Äôt sure who to talk to about this issue but I figured talking to you is a start.

Subject: Misappropriation of Lottery Funds

Comment: Robbing funds from schools that have been provided by the North Carolina EDUCATION Lottery is fundamentally wrong. As a 40-year-old college student who has returned to school to re-train for another career, I have already felt the burden placed upon me from the school having to give back money to the state that was already allocated to my school. At some point in time, someone in this state and country will realize that education really should have a much higher priority that it current receives when it comes to budget money allocation. I challenge YOU to FIX the laws surrounding the EDUCATION lottery so that money from that system is ONLY used for educational purposes as it was ORIGINALLY INTENDED. When we, the little people, suffer a shortcoming in revenues, we don't have the luxury of borrowing from some other fund. For some strange reason, we have to either cut back or simply do without. Government is obviously above this simple fact of economics though.

Dear Madame Governor:

Thank you for your leadership and for living up to what you preach.† The lottery in this state is alive and active because of your†vote, and never has it been clear how any such entity should provide any more that 100% for education considering that is why you voted for it, right?† Who decided that only a 30% allocation was even ever†allowed?††It is still somewhat shameful that this lottery has tainted our reputation, but thankfully you will benefit it towards our future success; not towards giving outsiders big paying jobs, or politicians money to fight over.

And, thank you for taking seriously the requirement to balance our state budget.† I have recognized that you are considering our status in this world for sound management, critical†thinking, and trustworthiness.† Those qualities are not just happenstance.† Sincerely, you are our representative, and we must depend on your performance of duty.

Dear Governor, our state of North Carolina is greater than most could fathom.† You must begin to prove our independent nature, our individual rights as citizens, and our natural capacity to lead through personal responsibility.† We have always found cause to take care of our people, and as long as we are free then we would not fail at that mission.† Our people and our land belong to this historical truth, and to begin to diminish our freedom or†this heritage through governmental control or force is opposite of our culture.

Are you a tarheel born or bred?† Either is acceptable when you regard our way of life as preeminent.† North Carolina does not need interference.† We have the finest expertise and ethics in the universe......

Subject: "Education" Lottery

Comment: Thank you for confirming what I knew a few years ago when the lottery passed. Anyone with an IQ of 10 knew politicians can't be given money and be expected to use it as it was intended/promised. I scoffed at calling it the "education" lottery then, and now know I was correct. Just like the "temporary" sales tax increase! Seriously, we are not that stupid! As I go out to the High School today to coach track I will stop and marvel at the 20 trailers being used for classrooms behind the school. I will know that the reason we have these fine facilities is that the governor can't control state spending on entitlements, so our kids have to go to school in trailers. Thank you Governor for bringing change to the way the state does business. Thanks for putting the kids first.

Governor Purdue,
As a supporter and someone who voted for you in the November elections, I was DEEPLY TROUBLED by the fact that you plan to use education lottery money on things other than EDUCATION.
I have been a teacher of mentally disabled students in Cumberland County for over 23 years. I often buy supplies for my students because there are no textbooks available. I could not begin to count the amount of money I have spent in my classroom over these past years.
I am more than disappointed with your recent decision to invest these lottery†funds in other areas. I am perfectly aware of the plight of our economy. Believe me, I feel it every day. But this lottery was created to support the school systems across our state. That was its' sole purpose. To know that the money intended for our students, schools and staff will be used in other ways, quite frankly disgusts me!!
I certainly did not enter the teaching profession to get rich, just as I'm sure you did not intend to get rich†when you†began your career in education.†But I was so hopeful that as a past educator you would "get it". The struggles that we face today to†teach and educate†our youth can be blinding, but yet we persevere.
I, along with so many of my fellow teachers put so much hope and faith in your campaign promises. But we have been GREATLY let down!
I am†sure it will be difficult to look us in the eye when you have to face us.
I look forward to a response from you or at the very least, your office. You still have a chance to "right this". Please don't let us down again.

Thank you,
Alison Boney, Teacher
Cumberland County Schools

Let me get this straight - We are taking money from the "Education" Lottery to pay for General Fund expenses, while we are†using Gasoline Tax funds to pay for education? How can we taxpayers have any faith in where our taxes are being spent when this type of stuff is going on?

As far as Senate Bill 13 is concerned, I'd support going even further - sounds like murder to me! I understand that making it a lesser crime may increase the chances of passage, though. Please do what you can to have the punishment for this act takes into account both the mother and the baby.

On the "Stimulus" funds, I understand the state accepting them, but I still haven't figured out how sending the money to Washington and then sending them back to Raleigh for distribution is efficent. Is Washington better at knowing North Carolina's needs than we are here?

Thanks for the updates.

Subject: Lottery Money

Comment: Governor Bev Perdue, I must say that I am very disappointed in you. We gave you all our support for a number of reasons. One of the main ones was you said the Lottery Money would never be touched for anything but schools. Shame on you.

Subject: Transfer funds

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue, I understand that you plan or want to transfer some $87.6 million from the lottery funds to the general funds. I object to this. When we voted on this program we were told the funds would be used for education and now, politicians want to transfer them to cover other spending that they have made. This is WRONG. The same think has been done with the Highway Funds. We pay high gasoline taxes which we were promised would be use to build, repair and maintain our roads. Yet funds have been used for other programs and then our roads become a mess with no money to fix them. When will politicians quit lying and do what they promised? Will it take a revolution? Thank you for considering this

Subject: Education

Comment: I demand that you remove any reference to education from the North Carolina lottery. You are marketing a lie. Have you no shame. I concede that you were skillful in finding a way to create a voluntary tax on the poorest of this state, and making them eager to pay it. However, to do it in the name of education while robbing the education system of desperately need funds is despicable.

Subject: Spending (out of control)

Comment: What are you going to do about the current trend of out-of-control spending? I understand that you have just raided the Education Lottery, removing $88 million that was intended for education/schools. You said you would never do this during your campaign. Can we trust anyone in government, anymore? You have been in control of state finances for 8 years prior to becoming governor, and now you appear to be taking spending to the next level. Even the $6 billion from the Obama stimulus package is being spent too quickly. When are you going to get control of spending? We taxpayers cannot continue to support the level of spending you are demonstrating!

Subject: NC Gov. Perdue takes NC Education Lottery.

Comment: This to me was appalling. I know that times are tough and budgets are pinched, but when I saw this on WSOCTV's news at 6 pm last night, I was mortified that our Governor took this money to use for NC's budget!!!! This is OUR Education Lottery. Our EDUCATION Lottery. What part of that is NOT understood to our Democratic Governor????? Where does it stop???? Who steps forward and says This Is Enough!!! The Government is robbing us blind! And now our NC Democratic Governor Bev Perdue takes the surplus NC Education Lottery money...Depletes it....For the NC Budget???? This in my mind is criminal. And to hear the reaction from Mr. Sheehan (NC Lottery Executive Director) and from Peter Gorman (Charlotte Mecklenburg School Superindendent) is depressing and frustrating news. Maybe Mr. Gorman does not blame the NC Governor for taking the money meant for the School system and for road construction, but I do. I blame this Democratic Governor for taking every penny of it just because it was there. One question for Governor Perdue from me....What if we didn't have the North Carolina Eduction Lottery, Governor? Where would you have gotten the money if we didn't have that lottery fund? Some people may think I'm overreacting to this, but blame me for holding our Government accountable!!!!!! That's just how I am. And with this Democratic Government that we have now, I'm doing my part to be diligent in calling any of the Politicians out when I see something that doesn't smell right!!!!! Here is Governor Bev Perdue's reaction when asked about it: "My priorities have not changed. Hold the classroom and public schools as harmless as I can." Governor Bev Perdue's response to all this. ???? How is this right??? How is this legal??? This is appalling and I hold Democratic Governor Bev Perdue responsible for this greed! And YES, I am sending a copy of this to Governor Bev Perdue as well because I am always transparent in my diligence with our Government. http://www.wsoctv.com/news/18865295/detail.html Governor‚Äôs Plan To Use Lottery Money To Affect CMS Debt Payments To comment on this story, e-mail Tim Caputo. Posted: 6:25 pm EST March 5, 2009 CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- A number of viewers have contacted Eyewitness News to ask why the North Carolina Education Lottery can't bail out school systems during budget crunches. Eyewitness News reporter Tim Caputo has been digging through the numbers and now has an answer. He found that 35 percent of all the money the lottery makes goes to education. First, the lottery pays off all the winners. After that, money is put into a reserve fund, in case sales are slow. That reserve fund can only have a maximum of $50 million in it. After it's full, money funds education programs. The money is split four ways: school construction, pre-K programs, teachers‚Äô salaries and scholarships. The money specifically has to be used for these categories. The money for teachers‚Äô salaries is given to the state, which hands out proportionate amounts to each county based on student population. The teacher money is included in the overall funding that the state provides to the school districts. Overall, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools got more than $730 million from the state last year. School construction dollars go directly to each county, not the school districts. That money can only be used for new school construction or to pay off old construction debt. Mecklenburg County is $1.4 billion in construction debt. This year, Mecklenburg County was supposed to get about $14 million from the lottery to pay off debt, but that amount could be lower this year. Governor Beverly Perdue recently took $88 million out of the lotto money to cover the state's massive debt this year. The first $50 million depleted the reserve fund. The other $38 million comes from the construction money. For Mecklenburg County, that'll be a reduction of about $4 million. The county still needs to pay off the debt, so they'll now have to find somewhere else to cut $4 million to continue their debt payments on time. Copyright 2009 by WSOCTV.com. All rights reserved.

Subject: Lottery Money

Comment: When I heard on the news today that you took the money from the EDUCATION lottery for other projects it really disappointed me. The lottery should be called just that a lottery if the money is NOT set aside solely for education. I know and realize in this day and times that times are hard. My husband and I own our own business and have to make ends meet in this struggling economy. I can't take money from my daughter because I need it and I have to balance things with the money that I have. So should the government. I'm so tired of taxes being raised and money going out of struggling familys pockets while politions get richer and find new and different ways to waist our hard earned money that the government takes from us with no second thought from us once they are in office. This is not only my opinion, but also the opinion of my husband and his sister all of whom are voters. I also realize that you came into office at a bad time, but you knew what you were getting yourself into when you agreed to run. Look at all your spending every last penny. See where all the money is and I bet there are places that you can and should cut spending that doesn't effect raising taxes and hurting the elderly.

Subject: Education Lottery Money

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am a Democrat who happily voted for you. But I am appalled that Lottery money legislated for Education will be used to plug budget shortfalls. I opposed the lottery in the first place because I felt a state and people should actually SUPPORT education as if it is actually essential to our well-being. A major argument at the time the lottery was passed was that money in the budget for education would be displaced by lottery money rather than supplemented by lottery money. So, now we have a situation where the lottery money won't even GO to education. Yes, we have a financial crisis, but there are two reasons this is a very bad idea. 1. It is a violation of trust in government, particularly for those who voted for the lottery (I wasn't one of them) and makes the government's "noble" rationale for the lottery a lie. 2. It makes education appear to be expendable. When are we going to understand that this is one of our more important priorities in North Carolina. Miriam Herin
