Comment: I believe one of the best ways to stimulate our NC economy is for the state to send out the tax refund checks. I should have already had mine - that would surely help me and help the state.

Comment: I am so disappointed in how the NC dept of revenue is holding it's taxpayer's money hostage. It's been 4 weeks since I filed my return electronically and I still don't have my refund. I can't pay my mortgage or my electric bill. I don't care what your cash flow problem is, mine is alot worse! I will now make sure that in 2009 I withhold enough cash back from my state tax so that I don't have to go through this next year. You can bet you will not have interest free money to hold onto from me in the future. You should be ashamed of yourself! Glad I didn't vote for you!

Subject: Where do I bill NC for interest and penalties for not refunding my tax over payment

Comment: Since the state of NC has failed to refund my tax over payments from 2008 within a timely fashion (now over 6 weeks) I wanted to inquire to the chief incompentence running this state as to whom I may direct a bill noting penalties and interest on the $1960 due me by the State of NC. I find it ironic that you democrats who can not manage our government and over spent revenues cant seem to find the money to pay those hard working citizens back the over payments collected by this "fine" state. Maybe your proposed $1 per pack of cigarette tax will be used to help repay the citizens the money that the state has stolen from them so that your rediculous entitlement programs and wasteful spending can continue. I find it disgusting that you are looking for ways to further tax people in this economic time period when the rest of us who actually work are trimming the fat out of our budgets to survive. Here is a novel concept...if you dont have the money for it, dont buy it! Wow! What a day it would be if you and the rest of your democrat friends would actually say "Gee, we dont have enough money to spend so we need to tighten things up." Personally, you and the rest of the politicians in Raleigh disgust me and there is a special place in hell for all of you. In the mean time, please let me know where I can send a bill to the state as I intend on collecting interest on the money you are illegally with holding from me. Fair is fair, if you can charge me a penalty for not paying on time, the state should do the same. Here is a novel idea...why not suspend payments to you rediculous polticians until the rest of us get our money back? Hummm How many more years till an election? What a day when we get the sleaz out of the governors mansion and out of Raleigh!

Dear Governor,

We have always paid our taxes on time.  We have filed our taxes early in the season.  I was told by the Dept. of Revenue that our tax return had been processed and was approved.  She said you are asking people to be patient on refunds.  If we were unable to pay OUR taxes on time, the State of NC would not only charge us penalties, but interest as well, and would not be patient in waiting for us to pay.  We have bills that need to be paid!  I ask that you expedite the payment of our refund.  We thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Daniel Britt and Susan Prangley Kimel

Comment: I am currently due a $701.00 tax refund. I filed my tax return with the State of NC at least a month ago. Frankly, though, I don't really care if I receive that refund or not, as long as it is put to good use (feed a couple of hungry families, pay a months rent for a family, help pay someone's medical bill, or any other similar use) by the State of NC.

I would like to know why the state is not held to the same standard.

I called the NC Revenue service today to inquire about our refund status and was told our tax return was received on Feb. 15 (I sent the taxes by mail in a postal blue box on Jan. 27) and they started processing our return on Feb.27th. 4 whole weeks after it was sent. I find this odd that this is the first year in the 26 years my husband have filed our returns and not received our check in less than 4 weeks. We all know what you are doing with our money and its not fair. We have bills to pay to. I have always paid my taxes on time and feel you owe it to my family to send the money that belongs to us. We are struggling!!!!!!!! I'm not asking for a hand out only what belongs to me.

Comment: I would like to know why it is taking so long to process NC tax refunds. I hve received my federal refund and I know they process more paperwork the NCDOR. I cetainly hope the finds are not being held. This is our money tht has been involuntarily taken from my paycheck every pay period. If I over paid my state taxes you need to return the difference. If I owed taxes I don't think you would settle for receiving it when I "get around to it! It has been over six weeks and we have been offered no explanation for the delay. Only an automated message tht states "in process". In process HOW LONG? People need there money now more than ever. Disgusted with NC government

Comment: Hello Governor Perdue, I'm sure these questions are screened but I still wanted to address this letter to you. I had filed my taxes on Feb 16 2008. Today is March 23 2008. I check Dornc.com to find out where my refund is every day. It still says it has been received and is in process. I have called the Dpt of Revenue as well who can only acknowledge the same thing and that the refunds this year need a little more time. How much time do you need to give me my money back. I was laid off in October, both my kids are on medicade and wic. I really need this money and was wondering when I could expect it. I do apologize for the simple format and the straight forwardness of this email. I realize this may not be the most professional letter you have received but I'm just frustrated and really don't feel like making it as professional has it should. Thank You.

A total of 20,183 traffic and criminal citations were issued statewide.

Subject: Tax Refunds EXTREMELY DELAYED!

Comment: My biggest question is WHY are tax refunds almost TWO MONTHS behind! I paid my taxes on time, and the state held my money for a year, and now it is time to pay me back, and here I sit! It has never taken this long to get a refund. This delay is unacceptable! Look.......the least you can do is put a post on the NC Dept. of Revenues' website alerting citizens that there are delays for whatever reason. It is bad enough having extreme delays due to governmental problems, but even worse when you will not inform your citizens of such delays. Stop keeping taxpayers in the dark, and let us know what is truly going on, and why our refunds are tied up. We deserve to know the truth, and in these tough economic times, we deserve to have our overpaid taxes refunded to us in a reasonable amount of time.

Subject: State Tax Refunds

Comment: I would like to know where our state stands on state tax refunds? I filed electronic over 4 weeks ago and when I check the site it has continued to say they have been received and are in process. How long exactly does the processing take? Does NC not have the funds to issue state tax refund checks? If not, why have we not been notified? I do not like being lied to or have information kept from me. I work and pay my taxes. NC tax is taken out of every check like clockwork but when it's time to get my refund I am having to wait longer than told and it costs extra to file electronic so what was the point? So yes, I have a suggestion. Notify the people verbally if it is taking longer. We can appreciate it if you are honest with us even though we may not like it. If you are going by the last 2 digits of social security numbers like the stimulus checks last year of whatever, just let us know. I know alot of people like myself who are awaiting these refunds in this suffering economy and just making us wait without justifiable notication is just the same ole politics.

Comment: There are people out here waiting on there tax refund to pay bills. Just like North Carolina needs to pay it's bills. But the state seems to be holding on to this money it owes it citizens to pay other bills. I think the bill North Carolina should pay is the money it owes it's citizens so they can continue to survive in this economy. People are going to learn from this and adjust their withholding so you will see less tax income over the course of the year. And when they owe the state at the end of the year I don't think North Carolina will be as patient then as we are expected to be now. You aren't making any friends right now so don't get too comfortable in your new seat. Thanks

However, it is almost April and I really would like to have my tax refund. If I owed the state, you would still expect my check on the 15th of April even if I too had financial problems.

Dear Govener:
†††† I am a bit concerned about the status of our 2008 Tax refund from the State of North Carolina.† The Revenue Departments web search tool indicates that our return has been processed, yet no refund has been forthcoming.† Both our Federal and South Carolina refunds have posted to our asccounts as of three weeks ago.† Returns were filed at the end of Feb.,†If you could be of assistance we would be grateful.

Many thanks, and Good Luck

Subject: State Income Tax Refund

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing to you about a very serious concern that I have regarding the length of time it is taking me to receive my 2008 North Carolina Tax Refund. As you know, these are trying economic times for North Carolina and citizens do not understand why the have to wait 9-12 weeks to get a refund which they are due because the state is either inefficient or is broke and can't pay its bills. Citizens are required to pay taxes in a timely manner and with interest if they are late. My return is dragging into its ninth week with no end in sight and I am not being paid interest for the delays because the State of North Carolina is either incompetent or is insolvent. If this is the case, your office should be upfront with North Carolina taxpayers and tell them why they are being held hostage due to politics as usual in Raleigh or the incompetence of the North Carolina Department of Revenue. I intend to contact my local newspaper and have them do a story on this tax debacle and maybe then some information will get down to the electorate. I would appreciate a reply and not some hand to another bureaucrat. Thank you for your consideration.

Subject: State with holding tax money from the owners

Comment: I understand that you have decided to with hold sending out the state tax refund checks from the people that it rightfully belongs to for up to six months or more because of the state's enormous debt. The people are just as strapped for cash right now to pay their own bills and in some cases to keep food on their tables for their families. You should turn over the people's money to the people. This state is in the worst shape it's ever been in because of the policies of Easley...and seems like we're headed down the same wrong path with you...

Subject: State Income Tax Refunds

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: Why have you not come out publicly and leveled with the citizens and taxpayers of North Carolina and let them know that the State is insolvent and can't pay its bills? There is no excuse for the State not to be paying its bills unless it is insolvent. Delaying payments without proper payment of interest is against the law and the double talk and lies coming out of the General Assembly and the NC Department of Revenue and Mr. Lay is deplorable. State officials are more interested in triple A bond ratings than taking care of the business of the average North Carolina citizen and taxpayer. The Governor and the General Assembly as a whole are responsible for a lot of the current economic mess this state is in but you insist on budgeting with "voodoo economics" by counting on money that you do not have in the Treasury. Household budgets do not work that way. We can only spend what we have or earn. Governor, you need to address the people of North Carolina and admit that the State Treasury is insolvent and that the state can't pay its bills and not all of the crap about delays within the NC Department of Revenue because it does not have the cash flow to pay its bills on time. The NC Department of Revenue is in a state of default. Governor Perdue, you need to address this issue and I expect a prompt reply. State newspapers need to do an expose on state government and expose all of the lies that the citizens are being told by elected officials. Put politics aside and level with the people about the insolvency of this state. I do not appreciate state government under your watch that is being run like AIG. I expect to receive an answer to my questions. Thank You Larry S. Smith Constituent

Subject: State Tax Return

Comment: Good Morning, I'm expressing my frustration at the fact that my state income tax return has been filed since the last week in January, yet I have yet to receive a refund. When I access the State Revenue site I've been getting the same message for weeks, ie, "return received and being processed". When I attempt to contract the State Revenue Service all I receive is a recorded message. My entire professional career has been affiliated with federal or local government and I am conscious of the financial woes being experienced by government at all levels. However, I am mystified that the State of North Carolina has not escrowed tax money in anticipation of paying refunds, furthermore it is frustrating that no message has shown up on the state Revenue site which alerts NC tax payers to the potential that their returns will be delayed. I suppose it would be OK for the individual taxpayer to simply tell the state that he/she couldn't pay their taxes because they are experiencing "cash flow" issues. Respectfully, Bob Simpson Colonel USAF (RET)

Governor Perdue,

First of all, I think you are dong an awesome job especially with all that is going on across the state and nation right now!

I need my state tax refund!† My wife and I both lost our jobs within a week of each other last July and she is just now returning to work this month.† We have a refund due of $585 and have done everything just as we should have to insure an expedited refund.† I understand the situation the government is in and I have tried to be patient, but I had hoped that with all the stimulus money flying around we would have seen something before now.† When I call or go on the web, I am told the same thing over and over again - return has been accepted and is in processing.† With us being out of work and only me on unemployment, this refund is vitally important to us and is causing us to have to do without - sometimes even with food.† My 3 kids have really known what sacrifice is lately.† Is there anything that can be done to speed things up?† I really, really need this money this week.

Thanks,

Paul Kennedy

RE: NC Dept of Revenue, refund

Dear Governor

††††††††††† I hope you can help me. The Dept. of Revenue has decided to keep approx. $1900 of my money even though the tax preparer, (H&R Block) submitted to them that a complete refund was due me.† The Local H&R office in Boone sent in a second request for the refund that was signed for on 3/04/09. I have heard nothing from the Dept. of Revenue. The original notice from the Dept of Revenue was received by me in mid Feb.that the Department had decided to ADJUST the previous return done by H&R Block. See Dept. Of Revenue Notice Number 3589 251 090 220.

†The second return by H&R block had the preparers written note on the front sheet that states ‚ÄúAttached is a copy of the W-2 from Unum Life Ins. Co. with a NC withholding of $1920.00. The Taxpayer should have this amount refunded since the J-code-(sick pay) is not taxable Also attached is a copy of the NC return. Please process refund as soon as possible‚Äù Thank You Jeanette Lyons, Tax Preparer, H&R Block-Boone,NC..

††††††††††† †By the Dept. of Revenues own rules, I am (by their rules) quickly running out of time to do anything about this. Please look into this problem ands get back to me. I am now on Social Security Disability, so this money is important.

Comment: I filed for my 2008 $595 tax refund on 01/29/2009. I lost my job on 01/15/2009. Today is 03/27/2009. My power bill is past due and my water bill is past due. If I were late paying my taxes, there would be a penalty! Yet, I am about to be living in a home with no power or water, and the $595 due to me would allow me to keep my utilities turned on. This simply is not right, Governor. Please help. I pay my taxes, please assure that I am refunded what I have overpaid. I need this money. Jamie Richardson Concord NC
