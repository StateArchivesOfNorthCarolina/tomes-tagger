See The Emperor's Latest Edict. Bottom of email. The funny part is that it's not much different from actual practice. This group is simply beyond all belief. Why they are still in business is a real stain on N.C. government.

Reggie now says the release date is the kill date. Ah, haven't I been saying that??? They kill on the morning of the 3rd day. Well, yeah. We knew that too. The funny part is that Reggie or someone is setting himself up as an EXPERT on dogs. Oh, please....that's stuff for Saturday Night Live. The pictures tell a much much different story. The latest edict is just one more step in making adoption even harder. What's their mission???? Cleaning kennels is not part of it,whatever it is. Their "New Leash on Life" statement on page 1 of their site sure doesn't have much to do with practice.

NO, I don't think this guy is hound. Unless it's beagle. One picture, hard to tell. Can't get a size either. Every other shelter publishes the animals' weight. This is important to possible adopters. Again, Reggie fails to put out the information that might make a difference to an animal's continued existence. We need more pictures, real pictures, not mug shots so that they have their tag photographed which is a matter of the pound's bookkeeping. Other shelters bring in real photographers to feature the animal's best qualities and you know that Petfinder usually has 3. Again, these photographs are not intended to aid in adoption.

Gov what do you think? will you help, you could if you wanted to, but you also have to want change.
I will tell you how burke co did it,.. if you want to know... 
Office of the County Manager

Location: Administrative Building, 128 W. Main Avenue, Gastonia, 28053 
Telephone 704-866-3100

Animal Control Concerns:

Why? Why do you allow this to still go on in Gaston County?

If you havent attended a "kill session" You should maybe it will compele you as it has myself, maybe you will get off the pot and stand for a change.

Burke county did, ans we pick at them calling them country folk,.. at least they are civil and half way smart.. Or a whole lot smarter then you all. Or even Catawba county, took somone firing the director to make a change, and a change happened. Indianapolis, what did it take a CHANGE! By the time you read this you will be 
behind" It will have been circulated from computer to computer and the east coast will already know and all EYES are on you and what and who stands up to make a real change. Who wants to be the one who gets applauded and who wants to be the brunt of alot of sad heart filled emails.

I stand up for Sampson who died friday night in the gas chamber to no fault of his own. I am his voice and I will strive to get a change. If you need help if figuring this out, on how to make things change. I will be glad to ge the ball rolling and when it rolls it is fast, not 3 yrs out in the making, its no longer something we talk about that will happen it is happening.

This will help...<http://www.catawbacountync.gov/events/lethalinj.asp>http://www.catawbacountync.gov/events/lethalinj.asp

<http://www.wibc.com/News/Story.aspx?ID=104417>http://www.wibc.com/News/Story.aspx?ID=104417


Maybe its time for a change.. maybe that change needs to start with you.

Your in a trusted position appointed by people we as citizens put in place somebody needs to put the seat back down and get up actually make a change for the good.

Records are being kept for every animal walking in and everyone coming out. If you can not help in the change to make gaston a pet friendly place its time to find someone who will, time for a change..

Sad isnt it that while you sit at home tonight eating your dinner and enjoying your home, a dog is peeing on itsself and gasping  It vomits and deficates on its cell <http://mate.as/>mate.as it flips and flops from one side to the other trying to escape death.  A healthy dog named sampson who used to belong to the older couple down the road who had to choose between there medication or there dog of 6 yrs. Sad isnt it that we revert to cramming animals into a metal wagon and stuffing them into a box while we suffocate them. And nobody presses charges of neglect or abuse because this is the norm, this is as it is called the kill.
Have you ever been present when "the Kill" is taking place?
Everyone talks about it everyone knows it happens, but have you personally ever been there to stuff animals into the wagon and wheel them in and wait as they cry and whine and then when its silent open the door, only to discover hey they arent all dead, Sampson is trying to pick up his head to see you but then you close the door to do it again. Hopeing that this time it does him in. And if that doesnt well theres a baseball bat that will.
So tonight while you sit in your chair and flip from chanel to chanel sampson is still struggling to stay alive and will now die in the freezer. All the while your enjoying your night at home.
Sad isnt it. It is even sader to know that monday when you return to work and after you read this and blow me off as some animal rights activist with nothing else to do, you will go about your day as if never reading this. Its not your dog its not your fault, and it hasnt affected you personally yet.  You will go about your day provably go to lunch on the citizens of gason county youll leave the waitress a half ass tip and you will find somethig to keep you busy till its time to go home.
Prove what kind of person you are, prove what kind of representation you are giving for the county. Prove that your human and not just going through the motions waiting on a nice cushy retirement check.
Its time for a change if the change doesnt start from where your at, I'll keep climbing till someone makes a stand and makes a change.

I told you on the phone Im not afraid, and I have nothing to loose. It takes people like myself challenging people like you to get things done.
Oh and you dont need to spend the day driving all the way to forsyth all you have to do is look right next door. Lincoln, catawba, meckelnburg... ect.. Dont waste tax payers money driving all over, donate it to building a new shelter. Maybe if everyone was more responsible with county money we would have a shelter.. Learn from those right around you, waste of money time and energy to drive all over the country to not do anything when you get back anyhow. Watch the unnessesary field trips. Help build a shelter.

let me remind you of your mission
Mission:
The mission of the County Manager is to provideprofessional (theres nothing proffessional about how the animals are killed)management and support of county government by supervising departmental operations, recommending policies and programs to the Board of Commissioners, and ensuring that the directives and policies established by the Board of Commissioners are implemented.

New Animal Care and Control Director Begins Work 
By Reed Parker 
1/23/2009 
The new Indianapolis Animal Care and Control director has been introduced to the community. 
Douglas Rae comes to Indianapolis from Philadelphiaand has served in several positions in the animal welfare field after leaving a corporate career in 2003. 
Rae says he chose to come to Indianapolis due to the partnerships already in place with the Humane Society and city. 
Rae says he has already made some changes at the shelter, such as temperament testing and a new way to clean the kennels. He says his goal is to have 80 to 85 percent of the animals that walk in the front door leave through the front door.

A Spaniel. Muzzle seems wrong. Age, between 1 and 2 years? "Experts", as Horton claims he is, give far more precise ages. This is not useful information. One more thing that indicates to me that these people are rank amateurs. Why would this lovely dog be categorized "Others", the group that gets killed the fastest? Did he object to being tossed in the truck, or growl when the choke pole was attached and he was dragged by it? This determination is not the result of temperament testing. The truck driver makes an on-the-spot decision. Based on what?

Two to four years? This is not an "expert" opinion. It's not even a good guess. They are not, apparently, equipped to make these determinations. And many others. So why are they doing it? Why "others"? Again, we don't know. We only know that is is not the result of temperament testing. Of course, I doubt if this staff can do temperament testing. They don't seem to do much else.
I notice since this pound, since it's failing inspection, has been trying to change their appearance slightly. You will recall when they were criticized for publishing pictures of dogs dangles, practically, from the end of a choke pole, they masked the pole out in subsequent pictures. Apparently feeling invincible, they dropped that practice fairly quickly. If this is the Old South, Reggie is likely as not untouchable. (I married into a Southern family. Yakuza, watch out!) 

Oh,sorry. I forgot the latest "edict" in the previous email.

HI,
       My name is Rita I run a non profit rescue in New England. Why are they still gassing at this place. I am sick over this place can't we get a petition together to stop this stuff.

There is a picture that is heart breaking not only a rabies pole which if the dog aggressive I can understand but Blood on the floor and the dogs mouth bleeding.  Why not take the picture thru bars. Look at his toe nail.

Shar pei? Again? Well,maybe. I've done this for a couple of years now and have seen one Sharpei come out of Los Angeles. Yet I have seen dozens from this pound. What's up with that? I do have some speculations on their bizarre breed attributions. A few wrinkles does not a Sharpei make. One to 3 years??? Expert? Ha!

Than you for contacting me with your concerns. I will speak to the manager concerning this matter.
Donnie

> -------------- Original message from DSC Channell <<mailto:dogarete@mac.com>dogarete@mac.com>: --------------
> 
> I sent this yesterday to Jan Winters before I realized that such is a useless effort, that Reggie Horton has persuaded him that Horton is running the shelter appropriately. 
> As a an informal group of national rescuers, we will not stop. We do not just disappear and go away. Don't ignore us. Start working with us. While you are pretending that Horton knows what he is doing, the rest of the country is watching and you look terrible. 
> Gentlemen, this is disgraceful. I work with rural shelters everywhere. In dozens of states. Small counties with small budgets. This is the worst I have ever seen. The Humane Society, PETA and the ASPCA are interested in situations like, with more than 200 animals found dead mysteriously, in their kennels after a weekend. In a month and half every animal pulled from this shelter died, one day at a time, so I was informed. 
> The letter is below.
> Dear Manager Winters:

Your problems with your animal facility are known all over the country. If I were you, I would be embarrassed. 

I would be more than embarrassed. I would be mortified. Gaston is being discussed in  California ,  New Mexico , Texas ,  Indiana ,  Illinois ,  Pennsylvania , Colorado ,   New York ,  Maryland ,  Georgia ,  South Carolina , for starters. I would be absolutely ashamed to continue to run such a seedy operation. I would, in your position, take immediate and drastic action. There are things that can be done and they can be done now. 

You don't have to like animals to uphold your public mandate and be a decent human being. You have to insure that the animals are safe and well cared for whether you like them or not. That is your mandate and you have publicmoney for this. 

Nobody in the entire country, that I know of, has seen such hideous, indifferent pictures of animals in sheer terror as the ones that Gaston publishes on the net. 

The things that can be done are simple. Of course, they require work and coordination. But you are a public official, so why not?

Fire Reggie Horton. Any human who would continue to house animals under the conditions that exist in that building is not looking out for the animals' welfare. The unexplained deaths and the enormous rate of disease are red alerts. One points to something or someone way out of balance and the other is a possible public health threat. Rabies is on the rise in  North Carolina  and not because of raccoons!

With his salary, take all the animals and place them in paid foster homes while you bring in portables to house the animals. Bring in runs! Dogs cannot sit in pet mate kennels for weeks on end.  Toss those filthy, never cleaned pet mate kennels. Buy new ones for the cats. One woman wrote me, hysterical over what she had seen. Dogs sitting in their own filth, no food, no water. (I know Reggie made noises about this after the facility flunked the first inspection. Do you really believe that it has changed? Try some drop in, unannounced visits.)

And bring in people who know animals, whether volunteers or paid, who can determine dominate breed, age, and say something about disposition. Check with other shelters. The wheel has been invented but that news does not seem to have gotten to  Gastonia . 

Gaston plays little tricks that you need to investigate. Tricks in categorizing an animal as "adoptable" or "other". Tricks in determining breed. Tricks in gassing in particular. If you are unaware of these, you are then insufficiently informed about the facility's operation. If you are aware of these,then you are not fit to continue in public office. 

I consider that it's possible that whatever you are spending on the animal facility is ill spent and mismanagement of public funds is not a nice thing to deal with. 

Please do you job now and put an end to Gaston's reputation as a house of horrors. 

Thank you.

Dianne Channell

Get this the animals release date is now the kill date, they took away our few extra hours of life to be able to find homes for these animals.
Reggie is not working with us, hes trying to do everything possible to just be as big an ass as possible. If you knew him on a personal basis you would understand.
He does not have the animal interest at heart, its all death or nothing at all. Go see, go visit, you will then understand.
If you notice at the bottom of this note theres a list of what we saved today and for tommorrow its not all by far, but we need the time. And reggie is cutting into that.

Have a beautiful day..... <http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/01.gif>

Would you let me know when your going, I would love to be there. But if not.. give me a shout I will send you the euth list for the next day. Tommorrow is a rough day there. Reggie has changed things the release date is now the kill date, it has been but we always had till 4 in the pm to get the animals out well he changed it to 8 am. So we have to get the animals out the night before at 5:01 or have an answer to them before 8 on the release date which is the kill date at 8 am. Check it out..
Mr Horton has no intention of helping us out.
I have so much to tell. The disease rate coming out is horrendous. I have personally moved 69 dogs and cats out of that shelter since thanksgiving.
All 9 of the cats I got died either of Calisi virus, FIV or Felv, all highly contageous. I have also lost 32 doggies, pupies of Parvo. I have one here now that got Parvo at gaston and he has been being treated for the past 2 weeks, the Parvo eats away at there intestines its absolutely aweful. The virus lives in the floor, in the rust on the kennels, it is everywhere. And this dog is 3 yrs old. I dont know if he will live or not, I cant even get him into rescue and the vet bills are mounting. All becasue of not getting vaccinated on intake. If he would have been vaccinated on intake he might have had a better chance. Instead hes having ceisures and wont eat because he relates eating with pain in his stomach.
Its sad, if they dont die of asphixiation in the (sp) gas chamber they suffer greatly from the effects of just being at the shelter. The entire ALGC has records and its not just the animals I have rescued that are sick.. Its so many.

I sent this yesterday to Jan Winters before I realized that such is a useless effort, that Reggie Horton has persuaded him that Horton is running the shelter appropriately. 
As a an informal group of national rescuers, we will not stop. We do not just disappear and go away. Don't ignore us. Start working with us. While you are pretending that Horton knows what he is doing, the rest of the country is watching and you look terrible. 
Gentlemen, this is disgraceful. I work with rural shelters everywhere. In dozens of states. Small counties with small budgets. This is the worst I have ever seen. The Humane Society, PETA and the ASPCA are interested in situations like, with more than 200 animals found dead mysteriously, in their kennels after a weekend. In a month and half every animal pulled from this shelter died, one day at a time, so I was informed. 
The letter is below.
Dear Manager Winters:

Your problems with your animal facility are known all over the country. If I were you, I would be embarrassed. 

I would be more than embarrassed. I would be mortified. Gaston is being discussed in  California ,  New Mexico , Texas ,  Indiana ,  Illinois ,  Pennsylvania , Colorado ,   New York ,  Maryland ,  Georgia ,  South Carolina , for starters. I would be absolutely ashamed to continue to run such a seedy operation. I would, in your position, take immediate and drastic action. There are things that can be done and they can be done now. 

You don't have to like animals to uphold your public mandate and be a decent human being. You have to insure that the animals are safe and well cared for whether you like them or not. That is your mandate and you have publicmoney for this. 

Nobody in the entire country, that I know of, has seen such hideous, indifferent pictures of animals in sheer terror as the ones that Gaston publishes on the net. 

The things that can be done are simple. Of course, they require work and coordination. But you are a public official, so why not?

Fire Reggie Horton. Any human who would continue to house animals under the conditions that exist in that building is not looking out for the animals' welfare. The unexplained deaths and the enormous rate of disease are red alerts. One points to something or someone way out of balance and the other is a possible public health threat. Rabies is on the rise in  North Carolina  and not because of raccoons!

With his salary, take all the animals and place them in paid foster homes while you bring in portables to house the animals. Bring in runs! Dogs cannot sit in pet mate kennels for weeks on end.  Toss those filthy, never cleaned pet mate kennels. Buy new ones for the cats. One woman wrote me, hysterical over what she had seen. Dogs sitting in their own filth, no food, no water. (I know Reggie made noises about this after the facility flunked the first inspection. Do you really believe that it has changed?

And bring in people who know animals, whether volunteers or paid, who can determine dominate breed, age, and say something about disposition. Check with other shelters. The wheel has been invented but that news does not seem to have gotten to  Gastonia . 

Gaston plays little tricks that you need to investigate. Tricks in categorizing an animal as "adoptable" or "other". Tricks in determining breed. Tricks in gassing in particular. If you are unaware of these, you are then insufficiently informed about the facility's operation. If you are aware of these,then you are not fit to continue in public office. 

I consider that it's possible that whatever you are spending on the animal facility is ill spent and mismanagement of public funds is not a nice thing to deal with.

IF THEY WANT TO KEEP THE SHELTER FROM BEING OVER CROWDED WHY DON'T THESE LACKWITS SET UP A FOSTER PROGRAM????? "Hey,Dianne, we just got in 8 more dogs. It's pushed us over the limit. Can you and Susie and Mary and Helen take a few???"    Locked into backward thinking!!!! ! KILLING IS NOT THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP THE POPULATION DOWN. AN ARRANGEMENT WITH A LOCAL KENNEL, AND PUSHING PUSHING PUSHING ADOPTION.........making it easy. Staying open late,even if it means closing during the day; asking volunteers to come in and cover the phones while they leave....... ...... How the hell many people belong to the AGL? Seems to me a few dozen!!!!!!

Hi Lisa thanks for sending this. Can we get more hours for the shelter to stay open and all these legitimate complaints from people would stop?  All we are trying to do is help save lives of animals that have needed up in a very very bad facility.   All the shelters I work with have Sat adoptions days, are open in the evenings, and are very helpful in getting animals out.  Right now Garo in NYC was able to cut the killing rate from125,000 animals down to 17,000 because he got things to change and shelters to help make that happen.  From what I have seen there is no reason for everyone of these animals at Gaston to be able to get out and into foster care, adoption or to a rescue. The only thing that stands in the way of saving lives the policies now that exist at this very outdated killing facility. 



New times are here and with the internet this facility is being exposed as one of the worst in the country as far as the inhumane treatment of animals.  I would like to continue helping change this facility to a more humane place where animals and people come together to help each other and bring a new purpose to this place and not the one it currently has of being filled with death and violence to animals. 



Take care,

Hi everyone,



I just wanted to write and clarify that this is not a new policy.  When Marcie was told that she could no longer do any type of animal related work during her work hours, she asked me to put a hold on all dogs and puppies for the next day until she was up and running from home. She can verify this for you. I spoke to Reggie about her request and he said we could do that until things were up and running.  We have been doing so since the first of November.



As you all know, Marcie has email now and is able to correspond once again, and has had for some time now.  Since overcrowding was an issue on the state inspection the shelter failed, we are trying to adhere to the release date as much as possible. Since animals are impounded throughout the day, we never know how crowded it may become at any given time. For instance, on Friday, one person surrendered 8 animals, another 4, and others 1 or 2. It may appear at times that we are not as “full” as we could be, but again, we never know what the day (or night) might bring.

As for “the release date is the kill date at 8 AM, no exceptions”, many of you that I work closely with know that this is not the case. Many exceptions have been made. Someone just needs to communicate that they definitely have a rescue for an animal and it can be held until 4pm. That has not changed. The release date has always been the day an animal is put to sleep, can be adopted, or released to a rescue group.

This information: ·  Rescues or persons wanting pets w/ a release date of Tuesday, Jan 27th, must have a confirmed rescue by 4 PM the day before the release date is incorrect. We must be notified by 5pm the day before the release date to place an animal on hold.  4pm is the deadline for the animals placed on hold to be pulled on the release date.

Please let me know if you have any questions, and I will be glad to get back to you.

Thank you,

Lisa Benton

from Wall Street to Main Street and everywhere in between, stay up-to-date with the <http://aol.com/?ncid=emlcntaolcom00000023>latest news.
The bill is endorsed by the American Humane Association, Animal Law Coalition, In Defense of Animals, Born Free USA, and many veterinarians and animal welfare organizations.  It would require humane euthanasia by injection of sodium pentobarbital, or an alternate oral version of the drug, for all animals euthanized in the custody of shelters.  Sixty-five animal shelters in North Carolina euthanize primarily by injection, and fifty-nine of those report using this method exclusively.  Employees in those shelters have been trained to safely deal with wildlife and aggressive animals.  Still, thirty-two county and city shelters kill animals in gas chambers made of cinderblock, metal, and even wood.   

Witnesses including veterinarians and animal shelter personnel have reported seeing animals struggle to escape gas chambers as they howl and cry.  "With respect to animal welfare concerns, carbon monoxide can produce agitation and convulsions in the animals before death, " says Paula Kislak, DVM, President of the Association of Veterinarians for Animal Rights.

Alice Singh, Board Member of the North Carolina Coalition for Humane Euthanasia, says after viewing euthanasia by CO gas chamber in Yadkin County, "I will never forget what I saw.  The dogs were trying to jump out of the large metal box, only to fail with the many other dogs in the chamber with them. The screams from that box will never escape my memory, nor will the many scratches inside of the box, or the blood in the bottom left after removing the dogs."  Alice has been working to end the gas chamber for 8 years in counties all over North Carolina.  Since that time, seventeen county shelters have made the change to humane euthanasia by injection. 

Gas chambers can also be hazardous for shelter workers. Inspections from government agencies including North Carolina Department of Labor, North Carolina Department of Agriculture, North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, and local fire marshals in Reidsville and Stokes County have revealed leaking and malfunctioning gas chambers and gas cylinders, which have in many cases exposed workers to high levels of carbon monoxide. 

But what about the cost?  A new cost study from national Animal Care and Control Consultant Doug Fakkema, commissioned by American Humane Association, shows that euthanasia by injection can be less expensive than the gas chamber.  This study was based on recent figures obtained from North Carolina animal shelters.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
North Carolina Coalition for Humane Euthanasia <mailto:nccoalition@yahoo.com>nccoalition@yahoo.com


Davie's Law/ Humane Euthanasia in Shelters was filed Wednesday, January 28 in the North Carolina General Assembly by Representative Cary Allred.  This bill is named for a little puppy who survived a North Carolina gas chamber, later to be found in alive a plastic bag in a dumpster by a citizen taking out her trash.  Many shelters still use the CO gas chamber and other cruel and inhumane methods to end the lives of lost and abandoned animals.  If Davie&#700;s Law passes, it would ensure that no animal would ever again be subjected to this treatment in a North Carolina shelter. 

The bill is endorsed by the American Humane Association, Animal Law Coalition, In Defense of Animals, Born Free USA, and many veterinarians and animal welfare organizations.  It would require humane euthanasia by injection of sodium pentobarbital, or an alternate oral version of the drug, for all animals euthanized in the custody of shelters.  Sixty-five animal shelters in North Carolina euthanize primarily by injection, and fifty-nine of those report using this method exclusively.  Employees in those shelters have been trained to safely deal with wildlife and aggressive animals.  Still, thirty-two county and city shelters kill animals in gas chambers made of cinderblock, metal, and even wood.

Comment: Please support Davie's Law and ban the use of gas chambers for putting down animals. Please, please stop this cruel treatment of animals. Euthanasia is a far less expensive, more humane way of putting an animal down. Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Governor Easley,
I am a resident of Illinois and I work at the local humane society. I recently found out that using gas chambers to kill dogs and cats in your state is legal. This is a very cruel, painful, and inhumane way to die. I understand that not all of the animals at shelters can be saved, but I don't see how this is even an option on how to euthanize these animals. I hope and pray that you will change the laws to stop this from happening anymore. I live in a small community with limited money but we are still able to put down our animals in a humane way. I have visited North Carolina and have family that live in your state. Knowing what goes on in North Carolina shelters makes me reconsider ever visiting there again. Please do something to help these animals, you are in a position to make a change. Thank you.
Sincerely,
Stefanie Pribble

Dear Governor, after seeing a video from your state about gassing of animals, followed by other research on the subject, I find the event to be appalling and inhumane. The video, seen from the “Helpsaveone.org” website was about ten years old but I understand that this method is still being used today in your state. There must be a better way to resolve this issue. It may appear to be cost affective in eliminating the over population of dogs and cats, however, it is a rather barbaric and painfully suffering way to eliminate these animals. I do not support gassing and I encourage you to lobby very hard to get your state to change laws regarding this. I will continue to research this on going occurrence in other states and reach out to others that feel as I do. I appreciate your time and efforts.



Thank You,



Joe Adiletta

Subject: End Gas Chamber in North Carolina

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue: Although I am not a citizen of your state, I, however, would like to join with your citizens who want to see companion animals when having to be put down be done so humanely. That is why I am asking you to approve the bill now in your legislature, H.R. 6 which does the following: The bill would mandate euthanasia by lethal injection of sodium pentobarbital or an equivalent, or oral ingestion of the drug, for all shelter animals. The law would ban injection, however, thru the heart, a cruel and painful procedure known as heartstick. Davie's Law would require the removal of all gas chambers from North Carolina shelters. Sixty-five animal shelters in North Carolina currently euthanize primarily by injection, and fifty-nine of those report using this method exclusively. Employees in those shelters have been trained to safely deal with wildlife and aggressive animals. In the 32 county and city shelters that still use gas chambers, some use commercially manufactured units, while others are crudely built units constructed of cinderblock, metal, and wood. A recent study from the American Humane Association by national Animal Care and Control Consultant, Doug Fakkema, shows that euthanasia by injection is less expensive than the gassing in every scenario. This study is attached to this article as a download and was based on recent figures obtained from North Carolina animal shelters. This bill getting nationwide attention and it would be in the interest of North Carolina to join a growing number of states now outlawing the gas chamber and show the nation and the world that it cares for its companion animals. Sincerely, Richard W. Firth

Dear governor
I am writting you to ask if you would please put a stop to the gassing of these dogs and cats... That is the worse way to be put down. I know there are alot of animals wityhout homes and money is tight for many mnay families but there are other ways to put an animal down peacefully. I don't know if you have ever not been able to get your breath, but I know what that is like. I couched on an ice cube when i was young and it's very scary.  But can you imagine being jamed into a box with as many as can fit. In the dark. no way out and then the gas is on. No more air!!!  Please try to put a stop to gassing. Please Please Please..

Comment: Please will someone do something about the gas chambers! How can something so inhumane still be an everyday occurance? I have spent a lot of time in N.C. and have always been amazed by the friendliness of the people, so how and why is this practice still in use? As a country we send our murderers to a death far nicer than mans best freind. Can you look the other way forever?
