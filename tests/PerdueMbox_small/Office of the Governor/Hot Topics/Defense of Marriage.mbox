I am writing to oppose the so-called "Defense of Marriage" constitutional amendment.

Please don't sponsor it and don't vote for it.

The fact is, this bill does nothing to protect anyone's marriages, but it would take away even the smallest protections for unmarried couples.

Our constitution should be about protecting rights, not playing politics.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I understand that Representative Paul Stam from Wake County has already
raised the issue on the House floor of a need for an NC Defense of Marriage
amendment. There are many critical issues facing our state and this is not
one of them.

I am writing to urge you discourage valuable legislative time being spent on
this issue and to encourage our legislature to on the state budget,
healthcare and education issues that are essential to all NC citizens.


Best regards,

I BELIEVE MARRIAGE IS ONLY FOR A MAN AND WOMAN BECAUSE GOD ESTABLISHED MARRIAGE IN THE GARDERN OF EDEN WITH ADAM AND EVE.THE BIBLE SAY IN GENESIS 2:21-23(New Living Translation for Women), "so the LORD GOD caused the man to fall into a deep sleep. While the man slept, the LORD GOD took out one of the man's rib and closed up opening. Then the LORD GOD made a woman from the rib, and brought her to the man. "At last!" the man exclaimed. This one is bone from bone and flesh from my flesh! She will be called 'woman' because she was taken from 'man'.

Therefore,keep it GOD'S WAY.  Plus, Our forefather built the foundation of this Country on GOD'S WORD and following it; that ,included, marriage between a man and woman.

I am writing today to strongly urge your support for the Marriage Protection Amendment that is coming up this fall.  I am deeply concerned that this proposal has been proposed in the past but has been blocked from coming up for discussion or vote by both Senators Basnight and Hackney.  I feel that this is a very important issue that needs to be discussed and voted upon.  To date 30 states have this in their constitutions which will allow marriage only between and man and woman.  I sincerely hope you will take the time to consider this Amendment to our Constitution and give it your support.

Dear

My name is Kimberley Barron and I am writing to you today to voice my opinions and concerns regarding marriage. I believe marriage is under attack in this country. I see many of the values and beliefs that made this country great, being torn away from within. We must protect our Nation, our rights and our Christian Heritage. God, not man, created marriage. God made a covenant of marriage to be between a man and a woman.  I am vehemently against same sex marriage and do not support any legislature that would permit same sex marriages becoming legal.

Respectfully,
Mrs. Kimberley Barron

Governor Perdue:

North Carolina currently does not recognize non traditional marriage. The Catholic Church, of which I am a member, does not sanctify and perform non traditional marriage. Under current law, no church will be forced to perform non traditional marriage. We certainly do not need a constitutional amendment to this effect as our NC Catholic Bishops will support at their February 24th press conference at the legislative building.

I believe that this proposed amendment is discriminatory and against the civil rights of any LGBT couple involved in a committed, loving relationship. Just as interracial marriage was historically illegal in North Carolina, this proposed constitutional amendment is unjust, hateful, and will ultimately be determined unlawful. Do not allow this amendment to proceed.

Subject: Banning gay marriage????

Comment: In recent weeks I've been hearing about an initiative to amend the state constitution in order to ban same-sex marriage. As a homosexual man, I find this alarming at best. "Pro-marriage" groups cite that they are "protecting" their "time honored institutions" and "preserving moral decency," and that brings me to my first question: WHO gave churches and their blatantly affiliated organizations (in our country founded on freedom of religion [and in turn 'freedom FROM religion']) the power to influence the legislative processes in a manner which denies minorities, of their choice, rights granted to all other law-abiding citizens? This leads to my next qualm: WHY should I (a morally ethical, upright, TAX-PAYING, and unfortunately in this case- minority citizen) have MY rights taken away from ME to suit the divisive aspirations of the "moral" majority??? Finally, if homosexuals are made second-class citizens through denial of a basic right granted to even those who are incarcerated or drug-addicted, will churches and their organizations (who are leading the charge for a gay marriage ban, and have unconstitutionally injected themselves into politics [not that politicians aren't entitled to their own personal beliefs]) lose their tax exempt statuses? I think it is only fair, afterall, THEY put themselves in the political arena to advance THEIR crusade. I'm sorry if this has come across as some sort of anti-christian tirade but I am fed up with it. Thank you.

Subject: Don't Sponsor the Marriage Discrimination Amendment

Comment: Our state is facing real crises, but some want to spend their time taking away rights from other North Carolinians instead of addressing unemployment, crumbling infrastructure, and the budget shortfall. This week, the so-called "Defense of Marriage" amendment will be introduced. Please don't sponsor it and don't vote for it. This bill does nothing to protect anyone's marriage, but it would take away even the smallest protections for unmarried couples. The rights of a minority should never be put to a vote of the people. Please help ensure our constitution protects, rather than harms our fellow North Carolinians. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Governor Perdue:

Dear elected officials,

We are writing to you today to urge you to oppose enforcing any legislation that supports marriage outside of what God has ordained--between a man and a woman only.

While we are called to always "love our neighbors as ourselves (Leviticus 19:18)", we cannot sanction what God has declared unholy. Please read all of Chapter 18 in Leviticus for what God says about unholy sexual relationships that defile a nation.

We fear you are giving into the minority with regard to supporting gay marriage. Please do not give our country, and our children's future, over to such depraved minds! Look at history, God has NEVER honored a people that supported marriage outside of a man and a woman.

You CAN STOP this movement of supporting gay marriage that is taking America down the path that the Apostle Paul references in Romans 1:21-28: "For although they knew God, they never glorified him as God, nor gave thanks to Him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles."

"Therefore, God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen."

"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion."

"Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, He gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not be done."

America was chosen by God to be a light reflecting His glory to the world, but this can only happen if we obey all His decrees. We don't want to be like Europe, nor do we wish to support things that defile the name of Jesus!

We can still love someone but not sanction their sin. Please do not destroy what God has clearly put in place--the joining of a man and a woman ONLY in marriage.

We are praying for you to make the right decision as we know you are accountable before the Lord one day for your decisions, as we all are, whether you believe that or not.

Sincerely,

Mr. & Mrs. Jon Wick

This letter is to inform you of my position on the Marriage Amendment Act and to ask you to vote for a constitutional amendment to protect marriage in North Carolina as being between a man and a woman.  There is no more valuable unit in our society than that of family as defined by a mother, father and children.  Children grow up in confusion when surrounded by homosexual union.  It is a perversion that does not create happiness, and to encourage its practice is to weaken the sanctity of marriage and the family--our most valuable American asset.  If you want misery, then don't vote to protect marriage, because homosexual union will not bring happiness and it will not result in a strong nation.  It will weaken us beyond repair.

Subject: DO NOT SIGN ANY MARRIAGE RESTRICTION OR DEFINITION BILL

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am writing to urge you to not sign any bill that restricts marriage between consenting adults, no matter their gender identity, sexual orientation, mental ability, race, culture, or religion. Any such restrictions are clearly unconstitutional, and the use of the Bible (no matter which translation or edition) as reference for such restrictions is clearly a violation of the separation of church and state. It is every adult's civil right to marry whomever they wish. Marriage is a union between two people, & is recognized by the state as such. Belief in a religion is an individual choice in this state and country; our laws must not be made to satisfy any religious doctrine. Remember, it wasn't so long ago that it was against the law for people of different races, as well as those w/mental deficiencies, to marry. People referenced the Bible then to support that restriction. We deemed them against civil rights & unconstitutional. This proposal to restrict marriage to one man & one woman falls into the same category. Besides the constitutionality issue, there's also the identity question: if you restrict marriage to one man & one woman, what do you do about transgendered or intergendered individuals? Where do they fit in? If you begin to restrict marriage on the basis of sexual orientation, where do you stop? And if you use the King James version of the Bible as supporting documentation, what do you do about more modern translations? What about other religions whose sacred scriptures are different? If you declare that marriage is for procreation, what do you do about infertile couples? Any restriction beyond age & number of spouses is just wrong. Please allow marriage licenses to be given to any two consenting adults, no matter their gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Thank you.

Dear Governor Perdue:
I strongly support NC Senate Bill 272, The Defense of Marriage Act, which would amend the state constitution to "provide a marriage between a man and a woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this State".
Many religious, political and judicial figures have eloquently spoken on this subject, but perhaps none better than Justice Stephen J. Field of The United States Supreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of anti-polygamy laws. Justice Field declared for the Court in 1885:
For, certainly, no legislation can be supposed more wholesome and necessary in the founding of a free, self-governing commonwealth . . . than that which seeks to establish it on the basis of the idea of the family, as consisting in and springing from the union for life of one man and one woman in the holy estate of matrimony; the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble in our civilization; the best guarantee of that reverent morality which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and political improvement.

I look forward to learning of your strong support of this important, and necessary constitutional amendment.

Thank you for your time and service.

Benjamin Keating

Subject: N.C. Marriage Amendment

Comment: Governor Hagan, As one of your constituents in the great state of North Carolina, I am outraged by the destructive marriage legislation that has been introduced to the N.C. House this week. N.C. Rep. Paul Stam and his right-wing supporters have recently entered a bill that would amend the N.C. Constitution and ban same-sex marriage, domestic partnerships, and same-sex partnership benefits. Barring Florida, North Carolina is the last southern state to steer down this path. These conservative representatives have used intense propaganda, unchecked by science or theology, to gain support in the N.C. House. They actually argue that same-sex unions would jeopardize the welfare of children -- a fact that is simply not supported by psychological or sociological research. Furthermore, they have gained the support of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh and Charlotte, turning a political action into a theological debate. I realize your position has many larger responsibilities, considering the enormity of our current economic crisis. However, I also recognize that you have strong ties with the gay community. I urge you to take a stand against this amendment, as it has long-term ramifications. In no way are gays and lesbians asking for preferential treatment. In fact, we're merely asking for equality under the law. The conservatives of this state are using personal preference and skewed religious views to influence governmental responsibility -- actions you personally spoke out against during your campaign race. Again, I ask you to take a stand in the media and in the N.C. legislature against such "political hate crimes". Effectively, this is what they are. Sincerely, David E. Witek, RN, MSN

Subject: House Bill 361

Comment: Governor Perdue, I've read the information about House Bill 361 and the actual bill itself today. The thought that we, the citizens of North Carolina, can have the right to marry decided by popular vote has almost made me sick. It's a civil rights lynch mob disguised as a vote. What other laws are decided by popular vote? Those sponsoring and co-sponsoring this bill are hiding their own prejudices behind a popular vote. I very seriously doubt that they would introduce a bill to make same-sex marriages (or even unions) not recognized in the State of NC - they'd be labeled bigots. Imagine if women's or blacks right to vote were decided by popular vote? I wonder how things would be if anti-miscegenation laws had been put to popular vote in the 50's or 60's? Ms. Perdue, my husband and I both supported you during our last election. I personally saw the opposition for having a female governor... and a Democrat at that from coworkers and friends. Still, many of us had faith in you and the results are obvious - you became our governor. Some background information about me. My husband and I have been together for 10 years. We own a house together, vacation together, buy cars together... just like any other couple. In fact, we were married in August '06 in Montreal. Our marriage is recognized in Canada, most of Europe and territories, and some states in the US. Now, our own home state of 35 years wants to not only not recognize of our relationship and dedication to each other but to sign into law wording that would legally invalidate it. I'm not sure what your opinion is of same-sex relationships, and it actually doesn't really matter. Opinions are fine; legislating them isn't. Forcing ones morality on others is not what this country was founded on. I'm also not sure what you can do about this bill. I am asking your help, though, in fighting it. What can WE, those effected by it, do to stop it? I've done the obvious (contacting our representatives), but two of the co-sponsors are from our own county! What can YOU do to help us, your constituents who elected you as governor, with this issue? Thanks for your time and consideration. David Stallings

Governor Perdue:

As a concerned life-long resident of this great state, I would like to urge you all to consider the severe consequences of legalized same-sex marriages.  To allow this to happen would undermine the very structure of our society which I believe to be the family.  I realize that many of our citizens are single parents who are doing an outstanding job of raising their kids on their own.  However, a family made up of one man and one woman is the backbone and foundation of this great nation of ours.  The consequences of same-sex marriages are yet to be fully realized but history teaches us that societies that allow such unions have never survived.  Please support a marriage amendment ASAP.  You are my voice in Raleigh and in Washington.  Please stand up for me and my family.  I'll be watching
and will remember your actions come election time.

Thank you for your service to this beautiful state we call home.

As one of your constituents here in Durham, I urge you to strongly oppose Senate Bill 272 [House Bill 371], which seeks to insert discriminatory language into the state constitution by making marriage between a man and a woman the only legal domestic union in North Carolina.  I have read the bill, and far from convincing me that there is a need for such an amendment (or legislation), its argument is that NC alone among the other Southeastern states has not yet voted on this issue.  The bill has no goal other than the promotion of anti-gay prejudice and, if preservation of the institution of marriage is its true intent, it provides no shred of evidence that flagrant discrimination and inequality are the right and best means of accomplishing that end.

If anything, North Carolina should strive to rise above its geographical neighbors in promoting human rights, acceptance of diversity, justice in the distribution of legal privileges, and separation of church and state.  The state and its citizens have bigger challenges to address in the coming years than to play to the scruples and insecurities of people who oppose social progress and positive change.



Please vote against the proposed marriage discrimination bill.  I look forward to your considered response and will follow the voting with interest.

Subject: Marriage is defined as one woman and one man

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, If you do not co-sponsor the marriage amendment bill, you DO NOT support protecting marriage in North Carolina! We respect the legislators who take a clear stand. It's the ones who say, "I'm all for protecting marriage", but won't co-sponsor the bill that we have a problem with. These legislators are just playing politics as usual. That may sound harsh, but its a fact. Many of our state legislators want to have their cake and eat it too. Please do not appease the pro-gay marriage crowd by not co-signing the so-called "discriminatory" bill. Marriage is defined as one woman and one man by God in the book of Genesis in the Bible. It is time for the pro gay agenda to be silenced on this topic. They can call their union any thing they want, but marriage is not acceptable or accurate. Sincerely, Nora Robbins

Subject: Constitution amendmend on same sex marriage

Comment: I surely hope we can avoid a Constitutional Amendment prohibiting same sex marriage. There is no reason under the sun to prohibit "the pursuit of happiness" for individuals whether it fits the majority or not. This is a religi8ous issue and government has no business in it. My wife and I have lived many years with next door neighbors as lesbians; I can assure you it has affectd our marriage in no way. Thyis is an example of majority rule over the minority in a matter that has nothing to do with the majority. And that is mob rule, not rule by law.

Subject: Marriage amendment

Comment: It is very important that North Carolina add a marriage amendment to its constitution that defines marriage as being between one man and one woman at the time. Without that amendment an activist judge can easily rule that same sex marriage and marriage to multiple partners are legal. It is even conceivable that a person will be legally able to marry an animal. These type unions will destroy the family, as we know it. In addition to the biblical immorality of such unions, we will all have to pay the extra taxes to support children that fail to finish high school and other resulting societal problems. Statistics have proven that children reared in other than homes with a mother and a father are more likely to not finish school and are more likely to become wards of the state penile system. I urge you to past this amendment.

Subject: HELP

Comment: WE NEED YOUR HELP! Would you please use your influence to convince the leaders of our legislature to bring up the Defense of Marriage Act so the people of NC can vote on this amendment in November 2009? When you were campaigning you spoke about your family and the love you had for them. It only takes one liberal judge to rule and would destroy marriage as we know it. North Carolina is the only state in the southeast that does not have this constitutional amendment. PLEASE HELP! Thank you. Roberta Fulk
