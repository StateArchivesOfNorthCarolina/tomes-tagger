Subject: Lake levels at Badin Lake on the Yadkin River

Comment: Governor, As I believe you are aware, Alcoa Generating is attempting to get a 50 year right to draw down water to a level of five feet below full pond level rather than the normal three feet. This could cause some some serious problems to unknowing boaters or even more seriously for skiers. I have had first hand experience with a jet ski being beached on top of a metal plate that sticks up near the surface at a given lake level. There are both rocks and jagged stumps that can be just below, at or just above water level that can also be very dangerous. When the water level gets down to the five foot level, lives will be jeopardized. I've seen a boat that hit an obstacle and had a gash down one side that cost a substantial amount of money to repair. Badin is a beautiful lake and it would be a tragedy to allow lake levels to be lowered enough to cause endangerment of human life. As we understand it, this is all about money and how much power Alcoa can sell. Two feet of water can't make that much difference. Thanks for your consideration. Don Berrier 336-461-4457

Subject: Badin Lake vs Alcoa

Comment: Hi Miss. Perdue congratulations on the election first of all! Just a note letting know the concern of the citizens and property owners around Badin Lake stating our worries about Alcoa (a private company) controlling an entire river basin for there own greedy profits and gains. For the last 2 years my "lake front property" has been useless and dry and for the only reason of foresaid greed. The lakes just above Badin (Tuckertown and Tillery) remained full! Hummmm Alcoa clams "Drought" I clam BS pardon my french... Please please help the people of North Carolina have a safe place to go on weekends without the worry of stumps and boulders just below the waters surface. Hope you can help! Thank you James Tracy Davis

Subject: Alcoa Plans for Ruining Badin Lake

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue In this difficult real estate environment, we don't need additional challenges that reduce our home values even lower!! I have a lake-front home that is already valued nearly 10% lower than 3 years ago!!! With the Alcoa proposal to operate Badin Lake at 5 feet below full, my dock will be on dry land, and my beautiful home will potentially be worth less than my mortgage value!! Please don't allow Alcoa to put North Carolina citizens in more jeopardy to go upside-down on mortgages than we already are!! Please! Over 1500 North Carolina residents have sent letters to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) objecting to their proposal to allow Alcoa to lower normal operating water levels on Badin Lake (Narrows Reservoir) from 3 to 5 feet. We believe there were substantial errors in representing the interests of the people in the state during the license negotiations. FERC also failed to adequately recognize and evaluate the devastating effect in the local community of lower water levels on Badin Lake. We need your help and the help of our state agencies in preventing this from happening. To date FERC has not responded to our concerns. Alcoa is proposing to lower the normal operating level on Badin Lake from its existing 3 foot level to 5 foot. Neither FERC nor Alcoa have stated the reason why the decrease in operating level is necessary after 50 years of higher water levels. The proposed operation would allow the lake level to be lowered during periods of normal rainfall conditions when on average four times the amount of water flows into the lake than is required to flow out. The lake has been operated at 3 foot below full for the past 50 years and lowering the level to 5 feet will have a devastating effect on both the local community and visitors to the area. The water in the lake is a public resource that needs to be protected from the profit motivation of a private corporation. Lower water levels are particularly detrimental to water quality and pollution in the lake. Persistent fluctuations in the lake levels accelerate erosion and will stir up polluted sediments, reintroducing them into the lake system as well as transport polluted sediment down stream below the dam. Maintaining consistent higher water levels minimizes erosion, is good for water quality, good for the environment, good for fish and wildlife, and good for users of the lake. We can find no good reason why the state of North Carolina or its state agencies should not support our efforts to maintain more consistent water levels in Badin Lake. At the very least, the state should require Alcoa to maintain lake levels at its historic operating level of 3 foot below full pond during NON DROUGHT conditions. A slight increase in profit to a private corporation cannot be allowed to overshadow and destroy the social and economic well being of the local community. We are requesting your help to notify FERC that we are opposed to lowering normal water levels on Badin Lake. In light of recent pollution issues identified in Badin Lake, we are also requesting your help in obtaining the support of our state agencies to support the citizens of North Carolina who are concerned about these issues and their impacts on Badin Lake. We are not comfortable with the state granting the 401 Water Quality Certification and giving Alcoa a 50 year license until these important issues are resolved. Your help in obtaining a fair and equitable solution to this issue will be most appreciated.

Comment: As home owners at Badin Lake we are very concerned over Alcoa and FERC decision to relicence the normal operating water levels from 3ft to 5ft. below full pool. This would basically make our pier unsafe and we would be unable to use it. Realestate values are already suffering lets not make it worse by downgrading a beautiful natural resourse. please let us know where you stand on this important economic and ecological issue.

Dear Ms. Perdue,

Â·         Given the stateâ€™s budget shortfall and the overall economic troubles facing our nation, we must invest our tax dollars wisely and work to attract new businesses to our state.  The fact that Stanly County has spent $1 million in taxpayer money â€” and wants the State of North Carolina to spends hundreds of millions more to take over Alcoaâ€™s business â€” is very concerning. 

Efforts to take over the Yadkin Project set a dangerous precedent and are bad for business in

Hi, Mrs. Perdue
  My name in Lynwood Butler , I wanted to talk to you about the Yadkin
River situation. I have  worked for Alcoa for 32 years and have worked
for APGI for over 10 years ,I also work for Stanly County Sheriff's
office ,so I work for both sides of the debate . I would, as you would
like to see a win, win in this but don't think that will happen. Most of
all I am a tax payer in Stanly County too .I know this is something that
you would like to get resolved for everyone involved . The problem is
this has been going on for over 6 years now  and the county wants more
than Alcoa will give them .This isn't about water rights ,if it was then
the county would be talking about Progress Energy  also ,which is on the
same river as APGI's ,down a few miles and part of it is in Stanly
County too. It is about land and that is the bottom line .I may sound
like I'm for APGI only , but working at the dams as I do ,I know that
they go to a lot to make sure that the lakes are clean . I work on the
lakes as a Sheriff Deputy too . I see all the people who enjoys the lake
and know that if it wasn't for Alcoa ,that big lake wouldn't be there.
So if you will look behind the scene  and you will see it also. If you
would like to take a tour of our dams I can arrange it .or you may call
me at 704-422-5547


Thank you

Dear Governor Perdue:
This letter is to express our concerns in connection with the delay of the approval of the application of Alcoa Power Generating, Inc. pending before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 

Although you have been made aware of the issues being raised by those communities who are in favor of a delay and intervention by the state of NC, we feel you should also be aware of the seriously negative economic effect the delay is having on the Davidson County side of High Rock Lake.

As you are certainly well-aware, over the past few years, Davidson County has suffered extreme economic decline due to the offshore outsourcing of both the textile and furniture industries, formerly our lifeline.  Without these industries, what will be our highest source of revenue in the future?  We contend it is tourism and leisure.  People are drawn here because due to the NC Barbecue Festival, Bob Timberlake Gallery and Industries, Childress Vineyards, more than 50 additional vineyards in the Yadkin Valley, and High Rock Lake.  Of these attractions, High Rock Lake stands to be the one that will bring more “permanent” money to our county as the snowbirds continue to move south and those in neighboring counties are investing in “stay-cation” second homes.

Under the new rules laid out in the Relicensing Settlement Agreement, formerly “un-sellable” property becomes viable.  For example, current rules mandate 200 feet of shoreline and an 8 foot water depth to construct a private pier.  Under the new rules, if a 50 foot lot was platted before 1987 and has a water depth of at least 6 feet, a private pier will be allowed.  Also, the proposed draw-down schedule and equalization of water levels among reservoirs means High Rock will no longer be “Dry Rock” and the levels will extend our leisure season. These changes will create millions of dollars of potential sellable property that otherwise is not attractive to those seeking lakefront property.  With the extreme decline in the real estate market in general, the delay of these properties becoming sellable is having a serious impact on our new economic lifeline – bringing visitors and new residents to the 2nd largest lake in NC and Davidson County. 

As a group of investors, we join with realtors, business owners, and other concerned residents of Davidson County, and urge you to consider that although it may have been appropriate to delay the renewal of Alcoa’s license prior to the devastating decline of the economy, to delay any longer is only compounding the negative economic impact in our community and possibly others who border the lake.  Furthermore:

·       The communities raising issues to cause the delay had nearly four years, during well-advertised and well-attended pre-application meetings to express their concerns and get the state of NC involved.  MOST of the interested parties signed the Relicensing Settlement Agreement, and in this country, doesn’t the majority rule?

·       We feel that given the state’s budget shortfall and the overall economic troubles facing our nation, we must invest our tax dollars wisely and work to attract new businesses to our state.  The fact that Stanly County has spent $1 million in taxpayer money — and wants the State of North Carolina to spends hundreds of millions more to take over Alcoa’s business — is very concerning.

·       Efforts to take over the Yadkin Project set a dangerous precedent and are bad for business in North Carolina.  We certainly agree with Albemarle Mayor Whit Whitley, as do many residents of Stanly County, and share his concerns that these efforts will make it more difficult to attract new companies to both Stanly and Davidson Counties.

·       The Yadkin Project is one of more than 20 privately-owned hydropower plants in North Carolina and should be treated in the same manner as other hydro projects.  Established state and federal processes should be allowed to continue without interference or delay.

·       With the installation of new technology that will increase dissolved oxygen levels, discharges from the Yadkin Project will meet all applicable water quality standards.  The Division of Water Quality (DWQ) review of the water quality application should focus on the quality of water being discharged from the dams and not be swayed by emotions or political influence.   

·       The important environmental and recreational benefits that were negotiated during the relicensing process are being delayed because of a few vocal critics.  A new license will allow ALL North Carolina residents to reap the benefits associated with new recreational opportunities, more stable water levels, improved water quality, and increased land conservation.

The majority of the stakeholders signed the Agreement and many of us based our business plans on those agreements, assuming that even though SOME did not get what they wanted in the agreement, MOST did – a compromise.  No matter who “owns” or manages the reservoirs, there are going to be some who are unhappy with the decisions and it will be impossible to make everyone happy. 

We believe, in light of the unprecedented state of our current economy, that more focus should be placed on how we can increase revenue and for Davidson County - that means allowing FERC approval of Alcoa’s license renewal application.
