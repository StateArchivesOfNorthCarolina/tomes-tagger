Comment: Dear Governor Purdue: I would urge you to support a "Castle Doctrine" law as proposed by N.C. Senator Brock. Many of our surrounding states currently have approved this approach to self-defense without the doomsday predicted by anti-gun advocates. North Carolina's current self-defense laws are a legal nightmare that leave victims of dangerous criminals in a situation that can expose them to legal and financial ruin on one hand, or serious injury or worse on the other hand. Our current economic situation will only create an environment of increased criminal activity and risk of violence for innocent citizens. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Michael Jacques

Comment: Hello NRA is working with State Representative Mark Hilton (R-96) and State Senator Andrew Brock (R-34) to introduce "Castle Doctrine" self-defense bills, which will seek to allow law-abiding citizens to use the force they deem necessary against a violent criminal attacker to protect themselves wherever they have a legal right to be. The bill also provides civil immunity for those who defend themselves from criminal attack. Cosponsor the "Castle Doctrine" self-defense legislation when it is introduced and support passage of this critical reform. Thank you. Danny.

If I am following the law and someone enters my home who is not following the law and is acting in such a way that I or my family feel threatened, I should be able to take the appropriate action to protect myself or my family and if I am not convicted in criminal court, I should not be able to be tried civilly for the same charges.

[NCDP-on-Trial] 105: †Peeling back the Wake County†Progressive Onion
.
This Edition is especially for you, David Young, useful in your continuing Orientation. †Before you were elected Chair of NCDP, your hangout was Western NC, where your Travel Agency business is. †Now that you're in Raleigh more than you might like, you're learning about how several parts of NCDP all cohabit together at 220 Hillsborough St, in the wonderful old Goodwin House, which has become Headquarters for intrigue and conspiracy in the NC Democratic Party.
.
At NCDP HQ, we find Jerry Meek's old Office, now yours. Also, a lot of empty NCDP Staff†desks, most of whom flew the coop when former Ex Dir Caroline Valand jumped ship. A skeleton Staff is there at 1/4 strength†<http://ncdp.org/contact>http://ncdp.org/contact, until you hire a new Exec Director, who will then hire his/her own crew.†
.
On the NCDP Website, under We're Hiring, you're still advertising for an Executive Director, even tho "Closing Date for all Executive Director Applications" was Feb 28th, a full month ago. Rumor is you're now looking Out-of-State, because no one decent In-State will take the job after all the wreckage JM caused to the Party for the past 4 years. †Who would want to have to clean up JM's wretched mess? †You got conned into becoming Chair without knowing what you were buying into.
.
Of course, the other problem is money.††Your last 2 weekly NCDP†Newsletters have stressed ONLY the Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner Fundraiser, still a ways off in May.†Is NCDP broke, David? †And are Fundraising Forecasts in our growing†Recession†giving you the heebie-jeebies? †Focus, David. There are other time-critical things, that money can't buy.
.
You didn't even mention far more important dates, April 14-25, when near-at-hand†County Conventions are being held:†<http://ncdp.ncdponline.com/2009-NCDP-County-Conventions>http://ncdp.ncdponline.com/2009-NCDP-County-Conventions. See how easy that was to advertise? †Now you can explain to Jerimee how to do it. Just publish a link, inside a short paragraph.
.
If you do NOT get a really great group of Chairs across NC, you're Administration is cooked before it starts, and Burr goes back to the US Senate in 2010. You've got a lot of old JM junk to deal with, and NOT a lot of time to do it. Your first hundred days ends on Mother's Day.
____________________________________
.
But Goodwin House houses more than just the State Party Offices. †
.
Wake County Dem Party --†with all it's many Subdivisions, pays rent to be there -- an even greater hotbed of intrigue, especially since the Witches of Wake emerged to take over. You think they just popped-out full-grown at SEC on Jan 31st where you were elected Chair, David? †Nope. They've been gaggling around for years, but accelerated to abuse of power under Lobbyist Doris Weaver's Chairship. †Doris anointed lieutenants, like Joanne Casey, Mary Alice Simmons, Chris Telesca and fellow Lobbyist Linda Gunter, to help keep troops in line, by intimidation and rumor-mongering, and threats at meetings.
.
When Witches realized Election of Ms Evangelista as Party Secretary†on Jan 31st would give her access to ALL Party Records to review at her leisure, the Witches of Wake panicked. †They knew what she might find. †So they pulled out all the stops, and began rallying Witches far and near, like Betsy Wells, former Chair in my native Cleveland County, and others from Forsyth, Scotland, Halifax, Guilford and Buncombe Counties.
.
You only saw their 3rd assassination attempt of Ms Evangelista, the big Public One at the SEC Meeting. Doris and Jerry made 2 earlier attempts, first with a Goodwin House Hearing on trumped-up charges, which Evangelista won at a Council of Review. †Then came Doris' Appeal to a Kangaroo Kourt Jerry had set up, where a pre-stacked "jury" of proxies ruled against her. See Comment #40:†<http://carypolitics.org/forums/showthread.php?p=51283#post51283>http://carypolitics.org/forums/showthread.php?p=51283#post51283† A lot about this is showing up on the Internet, once JM left power, just like with Bush/Cheney. GwB and Cheney can be tried for murder. What can Jerry and Doris be tried for?
_____________________________________
.
And then there's Wake County Progressive Democrats, subject of today's investigation.†
.
Looking closely at the Wake County Democratic Party Website is quite revealing. †For those of you from smaller County Parties -- where you're hoping just 5 people will show up to organize a Precinct --†you can get lost in the complexity of such a huge County Party. Just look at all the Groups they have:†<http://www.wakedems.org/groups/wcdp>http://www.wakedems.org/groups/wcdp
.
Eight (8) Auxiliary Clubs listed. †But wait. When you look for more info, they're not all the same:†<http://www.wakedems.org/node/12>http://www.wakedems.org/node/12<http://www.wakedems.org/node/1842>. †Seven say <http://www.wakedems.org/node/1842>Group Type<http://www.wakedems.org/node/1842>: Auxiliary Club. †For <http://www.wakedems.org/node/1842>Wake Co Progressives<http://www.wakedems.org/node/1842>, it says <http://www.wakedems.org/node/1842>Group Type:<http://www.wakedems.org/node/1842> <http://www.wakedems.org/node/1842>E<http://www.wakedems.org/node/1842>xternal<http://www.wakedems.org/node/1842>.<http://www.wakedems.org/node/1842> †<http://www.wakedems.org/node/1842>External<http://www.wakedems.org/node/1842>? †Hummm. †Seven legitimate children, and one pretender step-child. †Interesting family.
.
Other†Auxiliary Clubs have Mission Statements, and ByLaws. †Wake Co Progressives has neither, only a vague claim to promote justice, transparency and fairness, none of which did they believe when Wake Co Progressive Members publicly attacked an SEC Member on Jan 31st.
.
Wake Co Progressives' Website is totally independent, not sponsored by the Party like legitimate†Auxiliaries. So why is this self-serving group allowed to masquerade on the Party Website as if they were a legitimate Auxiliary? †Because State Chair†JM†wanted it, and Wake Co Chair Doris delivered.
______________________________________
.
Wake Co Progressive†Chair Jesse Goslin is also Chair of the Raleigh/Wake County Caucus for Progressive Democrats of America, subsidiary of an Out-of-State PAC. Name of the subsidiary PAC is Progressive Democrats of NC, Inc (PDNC), an independent, private membership Corporation with no legal connection to the NC Democratic Party.
.
There's a brag on the PDNC,Inc Website that this private Corporation elected JM†as Chair of the Democratic Party. In return, JM promised to sneak PDNC,Inc into His Party, so they could help reshape it into His Image. †And so, instead of working to help all good Dems across NC get elected -- which is the ONLY purpose the NC Democratic Party has for its existence -- JM spent his 4 years searching the landscape of the State, seeking fertile ground to plant Progressive Groups inside County Parties. †All the resultant dozen or so illegitimate Progressive Groups were fathered by JM. †None of them was sired by the State Party. †NOT ONE of them.†
.
Jerry joined with County†Chairs wherever he could, and planted†Progressive Groups†along the way, not unlike terrorist cells: lawless, aggressive Radicals, taking instruction from no recognized authority. †Progressive Groups are the ONLY Democrats who are allowed to endorse Democrats AGAINST Democrats, which the†Plan of Organization†forbids Officers to do. As illegitimate†Progressives grew into bully-boys, they pushed older moderates and conservatives out of the Democratic family, into the welcoming arms of the opposition Party. Sounds a lot like treason to me.†
.
You inherited this problem, David, the legacy†JM†left for you. †What do you do with illegitimate Auxiliaries once they've been born? †Maybe it's time to become a good step-parent, and push them out of your Party so they can learn to fly on their own, and you can get back to doing what you were elected to do, as Chair of the NC Democratic Party.†
_______________________________________
Breaking News: †A National Progressive Coalition is calling for mass Rally "actions" simultaneously in cities across the US at 2 pm on Saturday, April 11th. †One of 16 Supporters listed is Wake County Young Democrats. †How did this happen? It's not on the NCDP Website Calendar. This one is way over-the-top of what the NC Democratic Party supports or stands for.
.
Looks like Doris has lost control of the Wake County Party, if she ever had it. Cancer of Progressives is penetrating another Wake Co Party Auxiliary, causing them to also operate independent of the Party. Who the heck allowed Party Auxiliaries to morph into private clubs of its Members? †JM. JM. JM.

What happens, for instance, if the Raleigh Progressive Rally turns nasty, because Radicals from all over America are being invited to come? †What if people get hurt? Could your†NC Democratic Party be sued because it allowed†Wake County Young Democrats†to published it's name as one of the organizers of this Rally? †Does NCDP have enough insurance to cover liability for this Rally? †Think about it. †It's for certain that†Wake County Young Democrats did NOT. †<http://www.anewwayforward.org/demonstrations/>http://www.anewwayforward.org/demonstrations/.

And this is only the beginning of the troubles†Progressives are going to cause.

Update: †Wake Progressive Chris Telesca, identified in Edition 103 under Toxic Democrats, popped up again in the Cary Politics Blog link above (about Ms Evangelista). †
.
Apparently he cruises several Blogs, searching for targets, under a variety of aliases, including: Chris, Telephotonc, VVActivist and Progressive Pitbull. †He's been kicked off by one Blog Administrator. †Was Telesca a Progressive Green Dog first, or a mean-spirited†Pitbull who became a Progressive†in order to find folks to attack without provocation?

Why peel this many layered†Wake Progressive†Onion? †To show that -- unlike an†Artichoke†-- when you get thru peeling a†Progressive, there's nothing there. Like an†Onion, there is no Heart.
.
At your upcoming†County Conventions, if you elect a†Progressive†as an†Officer†of your Party -- as is so well demonstrated by what happened to the†Wake County Democratic Party†-- then you can kiss the peace, security and integrity of your†County Party†goodbye.
