ìI CANíT UNDERSTAND WHY THERE ARENíT RINGS OF YOUNG PEOPLE BLOCKING BULLDOZERS AND PREVENTING THEM FROM CONSTRUCTING COAL-FIRED POWER PLANTS.î - AL GORE

Itís time.

<http://members.greenpeace.org/event/view/3105/>
<http://members.greenpeace.org/event/view/3105/>We can determine the fate of our generation.†We know there is a climate crisis and we know we have to stop it. Weíve organized, weíve lobbied, weíve passed policies, weíve educated, weíve agitated, and still†our government has not recognized the scope and urgency of global warming. We know we have the capacity to transform our society, what we lack is the political will.

But now there is a new administration and a new Congress, which gives us another chance. We have a window, but we must open it. Together.

Like the movements that have come before us, we have an opportunity to send apowerful message of urgency through peaceful civil disobedience. There has never been an American tradition more noble, and it is needed now more than ever.

<http://members.greenpeace.org/event/view/3105/>Join†thousands†of citizens, young and old, who are taking action to lead us toward ecological sanity and sustainability.

Weíre taking our action to the Capitol Coal-fired Power Plant in Washington DC ñ a plant that is literally powering Congress with dirty energy.

It will be the largest mass civil disobedience to stop global warming in US history. Join us.

<http://members.greenpeace.org/event/view/3105/>

Toxic coal ash piling up in ponds in 32 states
January 09, 2009 3:11 PM EST
WASHINGTON - Millions of tons of toxic coal ash are piling up in power plant ponds in 32 states, a practice the government has long recognized as a risk to human health and the environment but has left unregulated.

An Associated Press analysis of the most recent Energy Department data found that 156 coal-fired power plants store ash in surface ponds similar to one that ruptured last month in Tennessee. On Friday, a pond at a northeastern Alabama power plant spilled a different material.

Records indicate that states storing the most coal ash in ponds are Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Georgia and Alabama.

The man-made lagoons hold a mixture of the noncombustible ingredients of coal and the ash trapped by equipment designed to reduce air pollution from the power plants.

Over the years, the volume of waste has grown as demand for electricity increased and the federal government clamped down on emissions from power plants.

The AP's analysis found that in 2005, the most recent year data is available, 721 power plants generating at least 100 megawatts of electricity produced 95.8 million tons of coal ash. About 20 percent - or nearly 20 million tons - ended up in surface ponds. The remainder ends up in landfills, or is sold for use in concrete, among other uses.

The Environmental Protection Agency eight years ago said it wanted to set a national standard for ponds or landfills used to dispose of wastes produced from burning coal.

The agency has yet to act.

As a result, coal ash ponds are subject to less regulation than landfills accepting household trash, even though the industry's own estimates show that ash ponds contain tens of thousands of pounds of toxic heavy metals. The EPA estimates that about 300 ponds for coal ash exist nationwide.

Without federal guidelines, regulations of the ash ponds vary by state. Most lack liners and have no monitors to ensure that ash and its contents don't seep into underground aquifers.

"There has been zero done by the EPA," said Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W. Va., chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee. Rahall pushed through legislation in 1980 directing the EPA to study how wastes generated at the nation's coal-fired power plants should be treated under federal law.

In both 1988 and 1993, the EPA decided that coal ash should not be regulated as a hazardous waste. The agency has also failed to take other steps to control how the waste is stored.

"Coal ash impoundments like the one in Tennessee have to be subject to federal regulations to ensure a basic level of safety for communities," Rahall said.

The Tennessee spill was at a Tennessee Valley Authority plant covered 300 acres in a slurry of coal ash and water, destroying homes and tainting waterways and soil with high levels of arsenic.

The utility reported a second breach Friday at a pond at a northeast Alabama power plant that was storing gypsum, a material trapped in air pollution control devices that is different from the sludge that spilled in Tennessee. Some of the gypsum reached a nearby creek before the leak was stopped.

The spills have renewed a 20-year-old debate about whether stricter regulations are needed to govern them.

Rahall and Democrats in the Senate are also calling for tighter controls, including a requirement for ash ponds to be lined.

"The federal government has the power to regulate these wastes, and inaction has allowed this enormous volume of toxic material to go largely unregulated," said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who chairs Senate committee that oversees the EPA.

In March 2000, the agency highlighted the risks posed by wastes in landfills and ponds. In an early draft of its proposal for a national standard, the EPA concluded that the wastes "have the potential to present danger to human health and the environment."

It also warned that the number of cases of contamination nationwide was likely to be underestimated because of poor state records and the lack of groundwater monitoring.

At the time, the agency said storage ponds posed an even greater risk than landfills when it came to leaks and spills.

"Surface impoundment controls occur at a significantly lower rate," the EPA concluded. And the pressure exerted by water "increases the likelihood of releases."

In 2006, the EPA once again found that disposal of coal waste in ponds elevates cancer risk when metals leach into drinking water sources.

The agency, which had set 2006 as a target for issuing a proposed regulation, says it is still working toward a national standard. A top EPA official also said there has been no "conscious or clear slowdown" by Bush administration officials who have run the agency since 2001 and often sided with the energy industry on environmental controls.

"It has been an issue of resources and a range of pressing things we are working on," said Matthew Hale, who heads the agency's Office of Solid Waste.

Over the years, the government has found increasing evidence that coal ash ponds and landfills taint the environment and pose risks to humans and wildlife. In 2000, when the EPA first floated the idea of a national standard, the agency knew of 11 cases of water pollution linked to ash ponds or landfills. In 2007, that list grew to 24 cases in 13 states with another 43 cases where coal ash was the likely cause of pollution.

The leaks and spills are blamed for abnormalities in tadpoles. The heads and fins of certain fish species were deformed after exposure to the chemicals.

Hale said the national standard would require monitoring for leaks at older, unlined sites and require the company to respond when they occur.

The industry already runs a voluntary program encouraging energy companies to install groundwater monitors. Industry officials argue that a federal regulation will do little to prevent pollution at older dump sites.

"Having federal regulations isn't going to solve those problems," said Jim Roewer, executive director of the Utility Solid Waste Activity Group, a consortium of electricity producers. "What you have to look at is what the current state regulatory programs are. The state programs continue to evolve."

Despite improvements in state programs, many states have little regulation other than requiring permits for discharging into waterways - as required by the federal Clean Water Act.

In North Carolina, where 14 power plants disposed of 1.3 million tons in ponds in 2005, state officials do not require operators to line their ponds or monitor groundwater, safety measures that help protect water supplies from contamination.

Similar safety measures are not required in Kentucky, Alabama, and Indiana.

And while other states like Ohio have regulations to protect groundwater, those often don't apply to many of the older dumps built before the state rules were imposed.

"The solution is readily available to the EPA," said Lisa Evans, an attorney for Earthjustice, an environmental advocacy group. "We wouldn't like it, but they could say that municipal solid waste rules apply to coal ash. They could have done that, but instead they chose to do absolutely nothing."

TVAís structure needs replacing, not repairing

December 10, 2009

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall

Humpty Dumpty had a great fall
All the king's horses, and all the king's men,
Couldn't put Humpty together again



It is easy for me to say ìI told you soî about the TVA but is hard to understand why the many millions affected by every action of the TVA still are not outraged by its dissembling, its obvious major management blunders - until now.

WWD Action Alerts: Keeping the Momentum Going - Getting Involved at the
Precinct Level










‚ÄúMeet Your Precinct Officers‚Äù

Sponsored by the Wake County Democratic Party

Wednesday, January 14, 2009

Cary High School Cafeteria

6:30 PM - 8:30 PM

Subject:  Invitation to Get Involved in the Democratic Party in the Cary area

Greetings!  Due to your efforts we were able to turn North Carolina blue and
elect Democrats at the local, county, State, and, Presidential level.  For those
of you who are interested in continuing the momentum for change, your local
Democratic party offers opportunities to get involved within your community.
The party will be holding elections for precinct officers in late February/early
March of 2009 and will hold the Wake County Democratic convention in April to
elect all of the County-wide officers for the party.

With your involvement, Democrats in the Cary/Western Wake area can:

¬∑        identify and support progressive candidates for County school board
elections and local council races that will be held in 2009,

¬∑        can plan and carry out voter registration drives that will continue
to increase the number of progressive voters which will increase our chances of
success at the polls,

¬∑        build a strong grassroots organization that is ready to support
local, county, state legislative, and federal congressional candidates through
voter registration, phone banking and canvassing,

¬∑        strengthen the grass roots organization so that we can have an even
stronger get out the vote effort for future elections.

This past election showed the rewards of a vigorous grass-roots oriented
campaign that focused on expanding voter registration, identifying and
convincing voters on a personal contact basis, and mobilizing strong get out the
voter efforts.

We realize that many of you have not been involved with the local Democratic
party.  We invite you to come to a "Meet your precinct officers" informal
gathering on Wednesday, January 14th, from 6:30 pm -8:30 pm at the cafeteria at
Cary High School on Walnut Street .  State Representative Ty Harrell will be the
keynote speaker and will discuss the importance of grassroots and precinct
organization.  Then you will be given an opportunity to speak to your precinct
officers and volunteer for various committees.  We will also have some light
refreshments.  This will be an opportunity to learn more about how you can get
involved in the Democratic Party at the grassroots level and to hear your ideas
for how the Democratic party can better serve Democrats at all levels.

I look forward to working with many of you as we continue our collective
efforts to support progressive change at the local, State, and federal levels.

‚Äì typically five years or greater. Also, if you have to do many

retrievals, scanning will pay for itself by increasing efficiencies in the

office.¬† With scanning, there are no ongoing costs.¬† You pay once and you

have a legal copy of your business documents forever.¬† Some examples where

scanning makes sense include Accounts Payables, Job Files, Corporate

Financials, Medical Files, Legal Files, Insurance Documents, Human

Resources, etc.

Ongoing, Onsite Document Destruction



Identity theft is the fastest rising crime in America. Companies can be

found liable if they do not protect information that can be used in

identity theft.¬† You can use our secure bins for paper that contains

information that might be used for identity theft.¬† Many companies now use

the bins for ALL of their discarded paper - sensitive or not - simply

because they know it will be recycled. It's just another way to help

protect our planet!


Records Reduction, Inc. provides FREE locked, secure containers for the

storage of your confidential material while awaiting destruction. The

containers are attractive and fit in well with all office environments. Our

containers will segregate and secure sensitive materials in between our

service visits. The containers are locked and can only be opened by

authorized personnel, eliminating the chance of sensitive documents being

made public or falling into the wrong hands. The locked containers will be

picked up and placed in a secure document shredding system.

¬†


In addition to paper document shredding services, Records Reduction

provides secure destruction services for X-Rays, Computer Hard Drives, CDs,

and Magnetic Media Tapes.

¬†

long after their legal requirement.¬† Shredding has become a necessary

business service to not only comply with regulatory requirements but to

protect your business, employees and customers from identity theft.

Experts recommend that you shred most files as soon as it is legally

permissible.¬†

eDocHealth ‚Äì Electronic Medical Records Solution



Enhance Patient Care, reduce cost of operations and increase revenues

through eDocHealth¬†

¬†


eDocHealth is a proven medical document management solution that

instantly improves medical office document access as well as practice

workflow by electronically scanning and filing your documents and making

them accessible to your entire staff regardless of their location. When you

minimize paper-based activity and work within a digital environment, you

trim overhead costs by reducing reliance on paper, streamline workflow with

quick access to information, and protect patient records with strict

user-control.

¬†


The burden of administrative and clinical documents in a medical practice

is considerable. Busy offices lead to inaccessible administrative documents

and charts; whether misplaced, lost, or in use by another staff member.

Physician practices continue to seek a solution to reduce or eliminate the

increasing volumes of paper within their organizations. The optimal product

would eliminate the issues of overcrowded office space and storage

facilities as well as the problems associated with paper medical records

such as lost or misplaced patient charts, patient EOBs etc ‚Ä¶. Medical

staff and providers demand a user friendly HIPAA compliant solution that

enhances patient care, and reduces cost of operations while increasing

revenue and generating a rapid return on investment (ROI).

¬†


eDocHealth is a cost-effective way to meet those needs, by automation of

administrative and clinical documents management. eDocHealth does not force

you to change your office workflow, instead, it can adapt to it or be

configured for ‚Äúbest operational practices‚Äù.¬†

¬†


eDocHealth can work in conjunction with your Practice Management software

and Electronic Medical Records software (EMR/EHR). In most cases document

management solutions are better suited to manage medical records than

traditional EMR/EHR. It is a non fact that document management solutions

have near 98% implementation success while traditional EMR/HER solutions

are more challenging endeavors.

New York's Fiscal Health

ARTICLE:
<http://www.nypost.com/seven/01122009/postopinion/opedcolumnists/mtas_fatal_dodge_149738.htm> MTA's Fatal Dodge
E.J. McMahon and Nicole Gelinas, New York Post, January 12, 2009
The media treated it as good news when the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union said last week that they'd settle their next contract through binding arbitration.

True, arbitration means the Jan. 16 expiration of the current Local 100 contract will bring no repeat of the December 2005 transit strike - but it also means the MTA has blown its only real chance to reduce projected operating costs and free some existing resources for vital infrastructure improvements over the next few years.

BLOG ENTRY:
<http://www.nyfiscalwatch.com/?p=776#more-776> "the cost of the average city worker is way too high"
Nicole Gelinas, NYFiscalWatch.com, January 11, 2009
An editorial in today's New York Daily News shows that what used to be considered a morally heartless and politically unworkable idea - cutting public-sector salaries and benefits to a manageable level - is now becoming mainstream thinking.

The Financial Crisis

<http://www.city-journal.org/2009/eon0111ms.html> Irrational Economic Man
Michael Shermer, <http://corner.nationalreview.com/#webbriefing>NRO Web Briefing, January 12, 2009
(This article is from City Journal Online, 01-11-09)
For roughly two decades, the new science of behavioral economics has been challenging what economists call "rational choice theory". . .But research in behavioral economics has revealed that many, if not most, of our economic choices are driven not by rational calculations but by deep and unconscious emotions that evolved over the eons. Among these irrational emotions is "risk aversion," a psychological effect that is actually part of the reason that financial markets work so well. People are more averse to risk than traditional economics would dictate, and that restraint helps keep most speculative market behavior in check. . .

<http://www.forbes.com/opinions/2009/01/09/postmodern-financial-crisis-oped-cx_ag_0110glucksmann.html>The Postmodern Financial Crisis
Andre Glucksmann, Forbes.com, January 10, 2009
(This is adapted from the forthcoming winter 2009 issue of City Journal)
Great economic crises like the one we are currently going through do not come from just anywhere at any time; they are stuffed with history. They are crises of the ethos of capitalism. . .

Diversity and the University

<http://www.forbes.com/opinions/2009/01/09/harvard-diversity-lamont-oped-cx_hd_0110donald.html> Recession-Proof Diversity
Heather Mac Donald, January 10, 2009, Forbes.com
The college diversity racket is immune to economic downturns. Harvard University has announced its latest diversity dean for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Any rational budget analyst would mark this deanship for the ax, since it overlaps with the senior vice provost for faculty development and diversity--and with the co-chairpersonships of the Standing Committee on Women. Yet it would appear that no financial meltdown, no matter how great, can shake academia's manic and irrational pursuit of a creature as imaginary as a unicorn: an even remotely qualified faculty made up of proportional numbers of blacks, Hispanics and women. . .

California Energy Policy Should Not be Imitated by U.S.

<http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=30231> Obama May Not Realize It, But California Is A Dependant Neighbor
Max Schulz, Human Events, January 12, 2009
President-elect Obama wants to base his greening of America on the great policies that California has followed for years. The global warming crowd embraces that idea, but skepticism is much more in order. California's model is broken: the state is bankrupt and so are its ideas on "green" economics. . .

Higher Education Reform

<http://www.mindingthecampus.com/forum/2009/01/uhohoptimism.html>Uh-Oh---Optimism
Posted by John Leo
The annual conference of the National Association of Scholars in Washington opened today on a rare note of optimism. Abigail Thernstrom, a Senior Fellow at the Manhattan Institute and vice-chair of the US Commission on Civil Rights said the election of Barack Obama was a historic turning point that will undermine the "racism is everywhere" mantra of the academic---left but not right away. She said, "winds of change are blowing through the intellectual world. No hurricane but a breeze. With Obama having run as an incidental black candidate and the long-overdue emergence of some maverick black authors, we are witnessing what might be called the incredible shrinking of Jesse Jackson and his allies. . ."

Legal News

Posted by Carter Wood
President-elect Obama has promised an unprecedented degree of transparency in the debate on the economic stimulus bill, saying <http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/dramatic_action/>in last Thursday's economic address at George Mason University, "Instead of politicians doling out money behind a veil of secrecy, decisions about where we invest will be made transparently, and informed by independent experts wherever possible. Every American will be able to hold Washington accountable for these decisions by going online to see how and where their tax dollars are being spent." Excellent intention, but the promise may be harder to keep than the Obama team realizes. . .

	NIH uses third-party 'surveillance' firm to keeps its guards on their toes

<http://origin.ih.constantcontact.com/fs046/1101765943856/img/712.jpg?a=1102403377826>The National Institutes of Health has hired one company (currently <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0019ZJ0cRzxid7dXAC0wBE69sZ6cGGAtElzppnHPc9fNSV270GhxXqZErvnD0uF9ICMccoUsZ7C4pXwNbAz2xQ9wlZAK9UVsGjb1JaJzQQVep3ZbrJcjTsFDw==>Triumph Technologies, Inc.) to perform quality assurance "surveillance" over the performance of another of its vendors, <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0019ZJ0cRzxid72CljFm90dGUFT8-nOZfPaWN0uCRub6gFUdgpmgmU0Jn14jJRDqQsl4J7Pnv83K1TTUcxmFX7lLqDkb26RmqFzJeHZZneNVkY=>MVM Inc., which holds a security guard contract worth about $27 million annually to protect the perimeter of NIH's headquarters and some of its satellite facilities.

NIH characterizes the arrangement as simply a good business practice, in which it asks a handful of Triumph employees to monitor the vigilance, attendance, alertness and other performance criteria of approximately 500 MVM security guards.

On Jan. 6, NIH posted a solicitation in which it announced it was looking for a vendor to handle the "surveillance" work -- NIH says it prefers the term "quality assurance" -- under a new contract. Triumph Technologies, a woman-owned, minority-owned small business based in Falls Church, VA, could win the follow-on contract or another company might land the new award. In either case, NIH will expect its next surveillance vendor to keep MVM on its toes.† <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0019ZJ0cRzxid79Gjw-VFSRDaGoYKHWyLq-m60XbJ9fjiyeNFBkwykp8tivs8LNooSN-ssyudyWOfrrwV781hwChCyFyAMjBeY8edy_c0We-WfSKCTAEeBb6wSeJQN8HHUL1iZdGdiVqS3bgozjftDbYm_QnbU4eGttnNinfjSRO7e26XU40ERtyg==>More

The underwater camera has pressure-resistant seals that allow operation to a depth of 25 meters (82 feet), according to the company. Its optically perfect, flat viewing window produces distortion-free underwater images.† <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0019ZJ0cRzxid4TAxuTC6TatEUxjgPJg4bDTkfuJszb4Q-MMqL65adfpV0hmBoQutTPh722MMZWsXFMc9nNeItV1eF3d2yXrtXguJODjI4tpr0WH98BdcTMPvgy1otddg55Y1naCCbnodt4KSgBM7KF2EpELT3PfRlaTEWfFqDlbSqOrMqMBDY34g==>More

	Is public video surveillance effective?

Detractors cite a variety of studies, many 10 years old, on the problems of video surveillance.

To the contrary, Scotland Yard recently released a study demonstrating that video surveillance helps solve 70 percent of U.K. murders. Not only that, but Scotland Yard concluded that video surveillance is as vital for forensic evidence as DNA or fingerprints.

Israeli drew many lessons from its inconclusive 2006 war in Lebanon; one of the more important ones is that Israel had been too restrained, too careful about distinguishing between Hezbollah and the state of Lebanon (i.e., civilian population and institutions) -- with the result being too many Israeli soldiers dead and an inconclusive end to the fighting; whether the different, more ruthless tactics used in Gaza will succeed remains to be seen <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001V7loAaoZ8Jx6RxUD-5dQfZX7omBqUHzDFr77i8gwerNCRFDk3zSA-1IgkThM6cVFZ8f6E9TPmzmmZMrIZngLvf3u4GQUPBVPFvu8KPK3L7XWIRrVOyzqFioxVgSsaRh_> full story

<http://norsworthyopinion.com/realusgovernment.aspx>Will the real US Government please stand up?



January 12, 2009



A battle royal went on in the Senateís hearing on the Tennessee Valley Authority Thursday, January 8, 2009. What was it all about? After all, it is the same federal government (I think) that showed itself off so badly. The TVA on one side, a federal government agency, and on the other side, well, it was the same federal government. And they both lost.

	Germantown, Maryland, January 13,† 2009 - Hughes Network Systems, LLC (HUGHES), the global leader in broadband satellite networks and services, last week announced the launch of its Inter-Government Crisis Network (IGCN), a unique satellite-based solution that enables government agencies to communicate securely and reliably in preparing for and responding to† an emergency --- when terrestrial networks are most vulnerable to failure.

According to a recent Frost & Sullivan whitepaper entitled: The Case for an Inter-Government Crisis Network, January 7, 2009, the primary problem is not the ability of first responders to communicate with each other in the field, but the inability to coordinate multi-agency response efforts at the decision-maker level. The report reviews the limitations of existing terrestrial-only networks, which cannot meet the high reliability, security and robustness demanded by such an ideal multi-agency network, and presents a comprehensive 6-point summary of key requirements that would greatly increase the ability of the government to serve its constituents in any crisis. To obtain a copy of the Frost & Sullivan whitepaper, go to <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001Kr3kUk9JYTIu61Zcxu6iqqzDSzU9UBTeSu9_mOj1uqUfTtOLgVCO9oO4f6WCthf5HSiwfOViEccDjY1Bs_E5SNXELazbb3s05hDMErKT2FWNaqiPxWvGbZQZf2IszDfhPRH5GmWcDhaJ5yQaVAF1OP2oPIi-h-5YJml00-P6GwtuKgbiQruo4FDwTzD0oBNvfKSJI_iysrp68smU6bdBR5-6fgiLTwlJGZwLxi_kSYakkNddWARDF87WJ1j1MxjY1scyTgf6BreS1cObFmVtYAoGysIUEE6yRu3-UwjyMR4WXEhnt0Z9BYge43gT2mb7gfDkkzEa8aw=>http://gov.hughes.com and click on IGCN.
IGCN operates over SPACEWAYÆ 3 from Hughes, the world's first commercial satellite system with onboard switching and routing, providing flexible and cost-effective broadband connectivity throughout North America for federal, state, and local government agencies. With the unique capability to instantly create any number of user groups on demand when a crisis hits, IGCN results in a cyber-attack safe, cost-effective environment that is unaffected by events on the ground and is interoperable among multiple agencies and levels of government.
"Leaders at all levels of government need to effectively communicate, coordinate and share critical information in the face of any emergency," said Pradman Kaul, CEO of Hughes. "IGCN provides the highly reliable, secure and robust communications networking that is essential to meet this requirement-regardless of the circumstances on the ground."
IGCN is available from Hughes via the U.S. General Services Administration's (GSA) SATCOM-II and Networx contract vehicles, GSA Schedule 70, and trusted partners.
The key benefits of IGCN based on SPACEWAYÆ 3 capabilities include:
* Bandwidth-on-Demand: unique bandwidth-on-demand feature supports multiple classes of service, including Constant Bit Rate (CBR) applications such as voice, video-conferencing, and new high-definition telepresence applications;
* Path-diversity: offers a true alternate path, redundant networking option ensuring that an agency can stay connected even if its primary terrestrial network fails;†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††
* Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-20: facilitates compliance with the HSPD-20 requirement that agencies provide for "the availability and redundancy of critical communications capabilities at alternate sites..."
* Security: it operates independently of the Internet, so member networks have the benefit of communications connectivity without potential breaches of security;
* Interoperability: enables agencies to establish pre-defined user groups as needed and on demand, facilitating rapid and responsive communications during a crisis;
* Compliance with National Response Framework (NRF): ensures communications continuity among inter-governmental leadership in support of NRF requirements to restore public safety communications systems;
* Cost-effective: provides flexible architecture and selectable service plans.
IGCN is available from Hughes via the U.S. General Services Administration's (GSA) SATCOM-II and Networx contract vehicles, GSA Schedule 70, and trusted partners.
Hughes announced the IGCN launch by showcasing its capabilities live via a satellite network to an audience of government and industry information technology (IT) leaders at CES Government 2009 in Lake Las Vegas, Nevada. Hughes representatives demonstrated the high-availability, live media conferencing capability broadcasting from three simultaneous locations:† Lake Las Vegas, Nevada; Washington, DC; and its headquarters in Germantown, Maryland.
CES Government is the premiere annual policy conference addressing critical issues that drive the acquisition and application of technology in government. Attendance is limited to 200 senior public and private sector attendees. Attendees are selected from past conference participants, as well as recommendations from the CES Government Advisory Board and Government Business Executive Forum.

University of Arkansas Study of Voucher Program Finds Parents Satisfied, Say They Are More Involved

FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. ñ Parents report that having a choice of where to send their children to school boosts their satisfaction with and involvement in schools, a study of the publicly funded school voucher program in Washington, D.C., has found.

Researchers with the School Choice Demonstration Project based at the University of Arkansas have conducted focus groups with parents over the four years that the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program has operated. They found that parents whose children attend private schools on the vouchers describe moving from the margins to the center of their childrenís academic development.

"This study provides extraordinary insights into the experiences of families participating in a unique publicly funded education reform initiative,î said Thomas Stewart, an independent consultant and lead author of the study.†ìTheir reflections will help refine the District of Columbia Opportunity Scholarship Program and inform other efforts to help low-income families secure quality school options for their children.î

ìThe greatest source of satisfaction reported by parents was simply in being able to choose their childís school,î added Patrick Wolf, director of the School Choice Demonstration Project and holder of the Twenty-First Century Chair in School Choice in the department of education reform at the University of Arkansas. ìEven D.C. parents whose children ended up returning to public schools tended to say that they were happy that they at least had a choice.î†

A summary as well as the entire report can be read online at <http://www.uark.edu/ua/der/SCDP.html>http://www.uark.edu/ua/der/SCDP.html.

President Bush signed legislation in 2004 that included $14 million annually for the program, which is the first federally funded K-12 scholarship program in the country. Eligible applicants were chosen by lottery to receive scholarships valued at up to $7,500 per year. Families of students who ìwonî a scholarship could use it to send their children at public expense to their choice of any of more than 60 District of Columbia participating private schools. The pilot program is up for reauthorization in 2009.

The U.S. Department of Education is sponsoring a quantitative evaluation of the D.C. program that involves researchers at the School Choice Demonstration Project. This qualitative study, in contrast, is funded by a grant from the Annie E. Casey Foundation and is focused on documenting the experiences of parents and students in the program.

A total of 110 families representing 180 students who applied during the first two years of the program volunteered to participate in this study. Their insights continue to shape the scope and direction of the program, and they will help inform other efforts to provide low-income families with access to high-quality school options, the report says.

The researchers examined the overall satisfaction of parents with the program and their childís school, what factors they considered most important in choosing a school, whether they believed they had sufficient information to make an informed choice when choosing a school, whether they believed their children were welcomed into the new school and how they assessed student development and progress.

A high level of parent satisfaction found by the researchers stemmed from three major factors:

∑†††††††† Parents appreciated the fact that they made the choice.

∑†††††††† They reported their children were thriving in the different school environment.

∑†††††††† They gave the Washington Scholarship Fund, a nonprofit organization that managed the program, a great deal of credit for the way the program was managed and for the care and attention they received from the organizationís staff.

Some of the other findings:

∑†††††††† The factors these parents considered most important in making a choice included smaller class sizes, school safety, religious or values-based environment, rigorous academic curriculum, opportunity to learn foreign languages, racial diversity and proximity to home. By the third year of focus groups, class size remained a crucial characteristic while school safety was less of an issue, in part because parents were confident that their children now were in safe schools.

∑†††††††† Families appeared to increasingly demand and appreciate the importance of extensive and reliable information about schools as they progressed through the program. The families placed a high premium on site visits and conversations with school and program personnel, with Hispanic families putting the most emphasis on these, possibly because of language and cultural gaps between home and school.

∑†††††††† Many parents placed greater emphasis on attitudes and behavior of their children, rather than test scores, as a basis for evaluating their progress. None of the parents polled considered standardized test scores to be the predominant measure when assessing their childrenís progress, but one-quarter used student grades to chart their childís educational improvement.

Several concerns parents expressed during the first three years of the program have been addressed, according to the report. Two that have not are the request for an independent entity to evaluate and monitor the schools and strategies that would open up more slots for students at the middle and high school levels.

	When failure is not an option, neither is second-best technology. The only complex data management system worth considering when lives are at stake is the one that provides flexibility, scalability, and a common operating picture that enables real-time data analysis and response.

Objectivity/DB enables organizations to build applications that can correlate information from multiple sources and create a common operational view of the battlefield, within seconds. Decisions can be made based on What Is, rather than What Was.

Download our complimentary whitepaper, "<http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001HIxRTzXpUM2Lswm_WewcX1nNBUsXxG2FPVr2KAzyOEt-PLxEX5tqh_Xl96zOfvlctzoVzEo4En9UCLopDsSnCj4DrSuXD4WsEZx3CyKHZQVq8-G-bJOF2zz6wrwGStOahgbdUlpYFj4f_Wr2Dr07gB-saXHoH1vRUdT3ozSbO8UivGe6wLHNk66b1NqF4jZA>Creating a Common Operating Picture," to find out how your organization can use Objectivity/DB to deploy systems with the most precise monitoring and data capture to provide decision support in mission-critical, real-time environments.

[NCDP-on-Trial] 089: †Last Call for NCDP Chair Candidate Statements
.
The NCDP State Executive Committee will meet in Raleigh on Saturday, January 31st, to elect the next†Chair and other Officers to lead the North Carolina Democratic Party for the next two years.
.
NCDems has received Candidate Statements from several who have announced Candidacy for Chair. †NCDems, as a standing policy, does NOT endorse any Candidate for any Office, even when asked to do so during Election 2008.
.
Emails sent to prospective Candidates requested that they answer the following 3 questions:
.
1) †Why do you want to be Chair? †
2) †What are your qualifications? †
3) †What are your plans for the Party?
.
On the weekend before the SEC Meeting, NCDems plans to publish Statements received by Friday, January 23rd from each Candidate seeking to become the next Chair of the NC Democratic Party. Candidates should Email their Responses to <mailto:NCDemocrats@earthlink.net>NCDemocrats@earthlink.net
______________________________________
.
What: † State Executive Committee Meeting
When: †12:30 pm, Saturday January 31, 2009
Where: McKimmon Conference Center, 1101 Gorham St. (off Western Blvd behind NCSU)
.
Who may attend: †All Meetings sponsored by the NC Democratic Party are free and open to each of the 2,871,239 Democrats currently registered with the Board of Elections. Arrive early if you want a seat to view the festivities.
.
Who may vote for NCDP Officers: †Each County Party sends a predetermined number of SEC Members. †SEC Members -- and Proxies for Members who cannot attend -- are determined by each County Party. If you wish to attend as a voting Delegate or Proxy, contact your local County Democratic Party Chair. But do it soon. There are procedures to follow. A list of County Parties and Chair contact info may be found here:†<http://www.ncdp.org/counties>http://www.ncdp.org/counties †

A copy of the NCDP Plan of Organization may be found here:†<http://www.ncdp.org/north_carolina_democratic_party_plan_of_organization_contents>http://www.ncdp.org/north_carolina_democratic_party_plan_of_organization_contents †The State Executive Committee is found under Section 4.01
____________________________________
.
According to latest Unofficial totals posted by the NC BOE, out of 4,310,789 Ballots cast in NC for US President, Obama won over McCain by only 14,177 votes. Had the Obama team NOT opened 50 Campaign Offices in NC, NOT sent hundreds of organizers into NC, and NOT spent many millions on TV advertising and numerous visits to NC, North Carolina would still be a RED State. The total cast for Obama was less than†the total number of Democrats registered to vote, by more than†700,000. There are also over 2 million Unaffiliated voters in NC.†
.
As it was, these 14,177 votes were the most expensive, per vote, in modern NC election history. Why? Because the Party operated by the outgoing Chair failed to rally Democrats to vote.†
.
Such a tiny margin of Victory can erode, throwing NC back to being a RED State as it has been for decades. This will be determined, in large part, by who is elected Chair on January 31st.
____________________________________
.
Democratic National Committee Chair, former Vermont Gov Howard Dean, announced immediately after Election 2008 he would not be National Chair again, reading the handwriting on the wall. He had so badly mismanaged the Democratic Presidential Campaign that President-elect Obama has not appointed Dean to any position, including that of Surgeon General, for which Dr. Dean was highly qualified.
.
The new DNC Chair will be Virginia Gov Tim Kaine, whose Commonwealth of Virginia's significant plurality for Obama helped push Obama over the top early on Election Night 2008. But even with turning Virginia from also being RED for decades, soon after the Election Kaine stated that Virginia was not a BLUE state yet. Kaine understood what the outgoing NC Chair did not. The gains of 2008 can easily be reversed in 2010 and/or in 2012.
____________________________________
.
With our Economy in Meltdown, Election of a competent and capable NC Party Chair is more critical than ever to the future of the NC Democratic Party. You can be part of this future, but NOW is the time to show you care. †January 31st is where this future begins.

New Report! Which Fuels Does the Tax Code Favor?

<http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/eper_04.htm>
<http://www.manhattan-institute.org/assets/images/eper_04.gif>Today, the Manhattan Institute's center for Energy and the Environment is releasing a new report by Dr. Gilbert Metcalf, "<http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/eper_04.htm>Taxing Energy in the United States: Which Fuels Does the Tax Code Favor?" Dr. Metcalf examines the important role the tax code plays in influencing investment decisions in different energy capital. He demonstrates how aspects of the tax code work to make oil, gas, coal, nuclear, solar or wind energy more or less attractive to investors.

America's Financial Crisis

ARTICLES
<http://www.city-journal.org/2009/eon0111ms.html> If We're Risk Averse, What Happened?
Michael Shermer, <http://realclearmarkets.com/>RealClearMarkets.com, January 13, 2009
(This article is from City Journal Online, 01-11-09, and appeared on <http://corner.nationalreview.com/#webbriefing>NRO Web Briefing, 01-12-09)
. . .As everyone knows by now, many of our major financial institutions weren't nearly averse enough to risk over the last decade and a half. In seeking quick and carefree profits, along with trying to appease politicians pushing for wider homeownership, they tossed all restraint out the window, with devastating economic consequences. How did this happen, and how can we keep it from happening again?

BLOG ENTRY:
<http://www.nyfiscalwatch.com/?p=779> Paterson may be too optimistic on the economy
E.J. McMahon, NYFiscalWatch.com, January 12, 2009
If the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is right, Governor David Paterson's economic and fiscal projections for New York State are not gloomy enough. The CBO expects higher unemployment and a somewhat slower recovery than Paterson‚Äôs budget has projected over the next few years, which means the revenue estimates in Paterson's budget are still too high.

The New Deal

<http://weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/995prayc.asp> The New Deal Metaphor
James Piereson, The Weekly Standard, January 18, 20090
Much as generals make the mistake of fighting the last war, politicians are prone to recycle old nostrums that were previously successful in getting us (and them) out of one crisis or another. For liberal Democrats, this typically involves the dream of replaying the New Deal and FDR's first 100 days. So strong is the hold of the New Deal over the liberal imagination that few stop to consider how different the world is today from the one Roosevelt faced when he took office in 1933 at the very bottom of the Great Depression. . .

How We Name Our Schools

<http://www.city-journal.org/2009/eon0112hm.html> What's in a Name
Heather Mac Donald, City Journal Online, January 12, 2009
A dispute over the naming of a new southern California high school provides a glimpse of the country's ethnic future. During a February 2008 hostage standoff, Los Angeles police officer Randal Simmons was slain by a gunman as Simmons tried to protect the gunman's family members (three of whom the gunman had already killed). During off hours, Simmons, a 27-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department and a member of its elite SWAT unit, had mentored teens in Carson, a hardscrabble industrial suburb south of Los Angeles. As a minister in the Glory Christian Fellowship, Simmons tried to keep Carson's youth away from the city's thriving gang life. . .the Carson City Council voted to name a new high school after Simmons in recognition of his service to the community. Since then, however, Latino residents of Carson have pushed to rescind the vote and to name the new school after Cesar Chavez, the farmworker organizer. . .

Israel and Global Public Opinion

<http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID=73ACE82F-0467-45C8-B572-96EDA5C0E7D2> On "Disproportion"
Andre Glucksmann, FrontPageMag.com, January 13, 2009

When conflicts erupt, public opinion tends to divide between absolutists who have decided once and for all who is right and who is wrong, and more cautious people who judge a particular act as appropriate or not according to circumstances, prepared, if necessary, to withhold judgment pending further information. The confrontation in Gaza, as bloody and awful as it is, nevertheless contains a gleam of hope. For the first time in the conflict in the Middle East, the fanatical absolutists seem to be in the minority. The discussion among Israelis (Is this the right time for war? How far should we go? How long?) proceeds as expected in a democracy. What is surprising is that the Palestinians and their supporters are taking part in a similar public debate, to the point that, even after Israel's launching of punitive operations, Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, found the courage to attribute initial responsibility for the suffering of Gaza's civilians to Hamas, which had broken its truce with Israel. . .

Posted by Anthony Paletta
A reader, Carl Olson (Pomona '66) writes us about a flap over the ban of Pomona's alma mater song: What kind of college has an alma mater song, but then refuses to allow it at Commencement or Convocation? It's Pomona College in Claremont, California. President David Oxtoby has made such an inexplicable ruling. Apparently he could not make up his mind. It started last February when he took the nuclear option of totally banning the alma mater song "Hail! Pomona, Hail!" based totally on an erroneous anonymous campus flyer. It said that the song had been written for a January 1910 blackface minstrel show. Without any historic review, President Oxtoby refused to allow the song to be sung at any Alumni Events in April or Commencement or other school events. . .

	Governor Janet Napolitano slated for DHS confirmation hearing Jan. 15

<http://origin.ih.constantcontact.com/fs046/1101765943856/img/718.jpg?a=1102406691061>Having delivered her final State of the State Address on Monday afternoon, Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano is heading to Washington for her confirmation hearing on Jan. 15 in front of what is likely to be a warm and friendly Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.


Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman (I-CT), who held a 47-minute meeting with Napolitano on Jan. 6, declared her a "superb nominee" immediately thereafter. "She is smart, no nonsense, a hard worker, and goal oriented," observed Lieberman, who said passage of the DHS authorization bill is his top priority. He and Napolitano discussed a number of other priorities, "including protecting the nation from terrorist attacks with weapons of mass destruction, cyber security, rail and transit security, border security, and chemical plant security," he added.† <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001jtlkx_sTT_Bx6NWqIcpnXcgooIMePQm0oo4JBBwSRPAD88SxxKV2fRyfyzvzWWciQuwKPylVYdorDgPnbN6KmmnQrEeiKoTZKqmZBSesZYkxqXjTdbl4lNJ0qhgRpK0KzOPDL4oL_p7ZJ6ZhRe4ms_hKVyun0kswsR8DHKcA0h-tBeN5-REbgw==>More

 Obama dominates among new electorate

In the 10 months leading up to the 2008 election, Democracy Corps conducted nearly 18,000 interviews in 16 national surveys with voters around the country. Based on a review of this extensive database, we've identified several key trends in the 2008 electorate that can offer guidance for progressive moving forward.

In this analysis, the first in a series of reports on these trends, Democracy Corps founders Stan Greenberg and James Carville, along with Anna Greenberg and John Brach of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, explore early voting, which took on new and greater prominence in the 2008 election.

Current estimates suggest that nearly one third of ballots were cast early in 2008, up from approximately 23 percent in 2004. The early vote had a distinct impact on the presidential contest and other races across the country. By matching Democracy Corps survey data to a list of actual 2008 early voters provided by Catalist, we are able to study early voters in detail: who they are, what motivates them, and how they tended to vote in 2008.

In some ways, a profile of early voters confirms expectations. They are, on average, considerably older than the overall electorate, and they are heavily concentrated in the primarily western and southern states that do not require an excuse to vote early. However, as unrestricted early voting has become more widespread, less obvious dynamics have emerged. Factors that shaped the 2008 early vote include voter engagement and enthusiasm, campaign contacts, and the convenience benefits of voting early, which are greater for some voters than for others. The interaction of these factors is complex and not always predictable, but the 2008 early vote data offers insights into this important and growing segment of the electorate.

ìThe transpartisan movement has begun to move America beyond the stale partisan rhetoric and fixed bayonets of past arguments. There are ways to rephrase questions and look anew at old challenges that unite Americans more than they divide us."† Grover Norquist, conservative activist, President, Americans for Tax Reform<http://www.transpartisan.net/clientuploads/photos/GroverNorquist.jpg>†









"We've wandered into a political region in which partisan conflict has become more intense than in almost any other period in American history. The transpartisan movement is beginning to foster so much communication across the partisan boundaries that the boundaries themselves are beginning to be much more porous."† Al Gore, Former Vice President<http://www.transpartisan.net/clientuploads/photos/AlGore.jpg>

The Waiting Game. Navy Secretary Donald Winter is expected to decide today whether he will stay on as the top civilian in the Navy until the incoming Obama administration selects his successor. Defense Secretary Robert Gates gave Winter a few days extension to make a decision, a source says. Army Secretary Pete Geren and Air Force Secretary Michael Donley have accepted Gates' invitation to remain in their jobs past Inauguration Day until their replacments are named.

Hill Grill. SASC will hold a confirmation hearing Thursday for the four Pentagon nominations President-elect Barack Obama announced last week: William Lynn as deputy defense secretary; Robert Hale as comptroller and chief financial officer; Michele Flourney as under secretary of defense for policy; and Jeh Charles Johnson as general counsel. SASC members Sens. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.) are lauding Lynn's selection. Robert Gates, the holdover defense secretary, doesn't require a confirmation hearing, but the SASC has called him to testify on Jan. 27. ìWhen he comes in front of us he will be speaking for the administration, so in a way it's more helpful to us than a confirmation hearing, because now he'll be speaking for the administration early in the administration,î SASC Chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) tells Defense Daily.

Supplementing The Supplemental. HAC-D Chairman John Murtha (D-Pa.) tells Defense Daily Gates's $69.7 billion estimate for the next supplemental war-funding bill is ìway too small,î and that his subcommittee is ìlooking at $16 billion, $17 billion more.î Gates sent the eight defense panel heads a Dec. 31 letter with his ìpersonal estimateî for the supplemental request, which won't gel before the Obama team's arrival and forthcoming decisions on force levels in Afghanistan. Gates, who previously eyed a larger supplemental amount but faced resistance from the outgoing Bush White House, also sent the Hill a three-page chart listing $17.6 billion in ìitems deferred for later consideration:î $4.7 billion for recapitalizing Army Strykers, Humvees, and trucks; $1.4 billion for replacing Navy aircraft, including one E/A-18 (G) Growler, eight F/A-18 (E/F) Super Hornets, and four C-40 A Clipper Transports; $6 billion for miscellaneous equipment recapitalization; and $5.5 billion for an Afghanistan force boost.

Reflections on the Bush Legacy

By Paul M. Weyrich


January 13, 2008


As President Bush prepares to leave office, a review of his eight years as the nationís chief executive is in order. While the end of his presidency has been overshadowed by economic problems and angry calls from the left about certain aspects of the war against radical Islam, Bush did have some success which should be recognized.

His greatest success in office came when he remained faithful to his principles - namely, his belief in the sanctity of human life. When, in 2001, the issue of scientific research on embryonic life came to the forefront, Bush wisely held the line on federal funding for the destruction of human embryos not already in use, in spite of calls from many that he was ìanti-science.î Six years later he vetoed the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, which would have permitted public financing of human embryonic stem cell research.

When vacancies appeared on the Supreme Court, Bush was able to find nominees who were highly qualified and who respected the Constitution, as written, to be the law of the land. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito have proven to be sound scholars, as well as serious and thoughtful Justices who respect the limits placed upon their branch of government by the Constitution. In other words, they have not tried to legislate ideologically from the bench nor attempt some sort of social or cultural engineering through the law.

One other success stands out. Bush frequently and consistently supported faith-based non-profit and voluntary organizations within American society. He recognized that the role they play in local communities, and at state and national levels, forms part of the bedrock of America. This is a theme as old as the country itself, but after the secularist assault on faith in the 20th Century, many of these groups struggled. Now more people recognize the services and resources these organizations contribute to those in need and, especially in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, how valuable they are.

In spite of the positive impact of these presidential decisions, there were others which have affected the country adversely. The most prominent of these is Bushís recklessness in fiscal policy. He did not veto a single budget bill in his first term, though many were saddled with pork and unnecessary spending. He did not begin to veto spending bills until 2007. In fact, in his entire eight years Bush only used his veto power twelve times. Compare this to his three predecessors: Ronald W. Reagan vetoed 78 bills, George H. W. Bush vetoed 44, and Bill Clinton used his veto 37 times. As a result, both the federal deficit and the national debt have ballooned to unsustainable levels.

Along the same lines, Bush enacted No Child Left Behind legislation intended to standardize and improve American education but which in fact removed much of what remained of local control and oversight and instead threw millions of taxpayer dollars at public schools which need serious restructuring, not more money. While some states have improved student test scores, the means of achieving such results often have been devious and cunning.

Bush also signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act into law in 2003. The program, which provides prescription drugs for the elderly on Medicare, is another massive entitlement program that we cannot afford. The cost of the first ten years of the program has been estimated at $1.2 trillion and counting. And since few government programs, once created, ever decrease in size, one can expect the costs of Medicare prescription drugs to rise much higher in the future, unfairly straining the finances of future American generations.

Finally, in recent months Bush has overseen one of the largest federal interventions into the marketplace in modern memory. His administration has nationalized banks and other parts of the financial services and housing industries and seriously has considered nationalizing parts of the automobile industry. Because of the precedent this has set, others now are trying to grab a piece of the federal pie. Most prominent among these are states which do not want to face the difficult political decision of balancing their budgets, though some cities have moved in on the act as well.

The one question hanging over President Bushís legacy is the result of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It certainly is true that since going into both countries the United States has not been attacked by radical Islamic terrorists, and Bush deserves credit for this. However, both wars are unresolved. Until they are it is impossible to determine whether each country will be better off than it was beforehand or whether we will have disrupted al Qaedaís network enough to prevent another attack upon U.S. soil. President-elect Obama must see that we do not leave either country as we did Vietnam, abandoning our allies and without anything positive to show for our involvement and loss of life. We must win and establish capable governments in our wake, though the sooner this is accomplished the better.

President Bushís legacy, then, is a mixed one. On the fundamental issues of human life and freedom of religion he has been a great leader. On economic and education issues the record is rather unflattering. And on the major foreign policy issue of his presidency, history has yet to write the final chapter.

 Findings from an Evaluation of the Formative Assessments of Student Thinking in Reading (FAST-R) Program in Boston Elementary Schools

This report contains findings from an evaluation of a program in the Boston Public Schools that seeks to improve reading instruction and student learning through one type of data-driven instruction. The program provides teachers with formative assessments that they can use to measure what students do and do not know, along with professional development on how to understand and use the data generated by those assessments. The study looks at FAST-Rís effects on reading scores among third- and fourth-graders.

New Report! Electricity, Zoning, and Urban Design

<http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/crd_neighborly_substation.htm> The Neighborly Substation
<http://www.manhattan-institute.org/assets/images/crd_neighborly_substation.jpg>Today, the Manhattan Institute's Center for Rethinking Development released a new report by Hope Cohen, "The Neighborly Substation." Cohen explains how New York City's antiquated zoning code hinders the acquisition of electrical power and land, and why New York can't follow the lead of cities like London and Tokyo, integrating electrical infrastructure seamlessly into the streetscape.

Click <http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/crd_neighborly_substation.htm>here to read the report.

Which Fuels Does the Tax Code Favor?

In his new report, "<http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/eper_04.htm>Taxing Energy in the United States: Which Fuels Does the Tax Code Favor?", Dr. Metcalf's research shows that there are some incentives in the Federal energy tax policy supporting the nation's efforts to produce clean electricity and transition to a carbon free economy, but that investments in the transmission grid receive among the least favorable treatments of all energy capital.

FROM THE PRESS
<http://www.eenews.net/gw/> Tax subsidies most generous for wind, solar, nuclear
Katherine Ling, Greenwire, January 13, 2009 (subscription required)
Renewable energy investment today receives a more than 150 percent return after taxes, followed closely by nuclear energy's 100 percent, said the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research in a <http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/eper_04.htm>report released yesterday. The report examined tax subsidies for each fuel and how investors respond to tax mechanisms. . .

<http://www.reason.com/news/show/131027.html>No Biofuels Bailout
Ronald Bailey, Reason Online, January 13, 2009
. . .In a <http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/eper_04.htm>new study for the Manhattan Institute, a free market think tank, Metcalf calculates that around 50 percent of energy subsidies currently go to fossil fuels and 50 percent go to various renewable fuels. . .

America's Financial Crisis

<http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2009/01/obama_labor_friendly_or_worker.html> Obama: Labor Friendly, or Worker Friendly?
Steven Malanga, Real Clear Markets, January 14, 2009
Combing through government disclosure documents that unions are required to file, the Los Angeles Times discovered last year that one of California's most powerful labor groups and a charity related to it had made hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to companies controlled by relatives of the union's president. The union, the United Long-Term Care Workers, also spent tens of thousands of dollars of members' money at fashionable establishments like the Grand Havana Room, a cigar lounge known for its celebrity clientele. . . In its investigations, the Times relied partially on government disclosure documents that the Bush Department of Labor had introduced a few years earlier. . .

New York's Fiscal Health

<http://www.nypost.com/seven/01142009/postopinion/opedcolumnists/detroit__the_abyss_awaiting_nyc__150131.htm> Detroit: The Abyss Awaiting NYC?
Nicole Gelinas, New York Post, January 14, 2009
New York has a modern history of good luck - and of finding good leaders when it's looking into the abyss. The city's luck has run out - but it's still got a chance of finding leadership on its dangerously bloated budget. To see what happens when a city runs out of luck and leadership, look at Detroit. . .

The Education Achievement Gap

<http://www.tnr.com/currentissue/story.html?id=3a0cdac1-44a1-461b-b676-d829b9f1529d> We've Had A Solution For The Black-White Reading Gap For Four Decades. So Why Aren't We Taking Advantage Of It?
John McWhorter, The New Republic, January 14, 2009
One does not expect to see New York's school Chancellor Joel Klein on the same stage as Reverend Al Sharpton. Klein is infamous for his emphasis on test scores and shutting down schools that fail to measure up. Not so long ago, Sharpton was in the barricades with Russell Simmons protesting mayor Michael Bloomberg and Klein's plan to cut New York City's education budget. Yet these days the two are teaming up for the Education Equality Project, which seeks to close the achievement gap between white and black kids in public schools. . .

The New Deal

<http://weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/995prayc.asp> The New Deal Metaphor
James Piereson, Real Clear Markets, January 14, 2009
(This piece originally appeared in The Weekly Standard, January 18, 2009)
Much as generals make the mistake of fighting the last war, politicians are prone to recycle old nostrums that were previously successful in getting us (and them) out of one crisis or another. For liberal Democrats, this typically involves the dream of replaying the New Deal and FDR's first 100 days. So strong is the hold of the New Deal over the liberal imagination that few stop to consider how different the world is today from the one Roosevelt faced when he took office in 1933 at the very bottom of the Great Depression. . .

Higher Education Reform

<http://www.mindingthecampus.com/index.html> MindingTheCampus.com
<http://www.mindingthecampus.com/originals/2009/01/the_most_important_documents_g.html>The Campus And The Nanny State
Richard Vedder, January 14, 2009
. . . The original Higher Education Act of 1965 was probably roughly 20,000 words long - well over twice the length of the Constitution but far less significant. The newest reincarnation of that Act, the 2008 reenactment (several years late), is estimated by my colleague Jonathan Robe to be 175,859 words long---over 20 times as long as our foundational rules of government - and vastly less important. We are approaching "much ado about nothing," or maybe the less appealing opposite, "little ado costing us a lot." Moreover, the statistics above understate the complexity of federal higher education legislation. In 2008, in addition to reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, Congress also passed the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act, The College Cost Reduction and Access Act, and the New GI Bill law, to name just three additional laws. The formerly accepted notion that higher education is primarily an individual or a state and local government responsibility seems to be dying. . .

	DoD spent $28.1 billion 'in defense of the homeland' in 2008

<http://origin.ih.constantcontact.com/fs046/1101765943856/img/721.jpg?a=1102408539156>For fiscal year 2008, the Department of Defense reported "obligations" of $28.1 billion "for operations in defense of the homeland as part of Operation Noble Eagle," as the domestic, homeland defense component of the military's Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) is known.

Contrary to some popular opinion, there is indeed an official Global War on Terrorism, and the DoD is required to enumerate its financial obligations to it in monthly reports, the Supplemental and Cost of War Execution Reports, which are the basis of GWOT budget requests to Congress, and which the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has in turn been required to study and analyze on a quarterly basis since 2006.

While the cost of the GWOT overall has risen, "DOD's reported obligations for Operation Noble Eagle have consistently decreased since fiscal year 2003, largely because of the completion of repairs to the Pentagon and upgrades in security at military installations that were onetime costs, as well as a reduction in combat air patrols and in the number of reserve personnel guarding government installations," according to the GAO.† <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0016yXFuqZfv594vYoUnwuouLEVomr9vKPY-gjgVxM3g52YrrQkSSILOBo_4_NNZYzRFA2nzLXu9ClxoVOYw3kyBY0DK2rNImButw9NV-q8K2ZyPR4V7gl9QL7VhK22b2M1XepnTq417ALlN_rpXGn7SF2Fv2wl5iDQ-jAEQNEMg5ej_nS6r1gT0A==>More

The contract contains several of Safeguards' perimeter intrusion detection products as well as the installation and integration of the system.

As the project's lead contractor, Safeguards will work with HCL Infosystems, a large contractor based in India that will handle the video component of the system.

According to Doug Vanderkolk, Safeguards' Vice President of Sales and Marketing, the contract was awarded in September 2008, well before the terrorist attacks in Mumbai which occurred last November, but the attacks only strengthened the resolve of the Indian government to proceed with the perimeter security project. Construction work will begin in the first quarter of 2009, said Vanderkolk.† <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0016yXFuqZfv5-k9sqrdxaHbURUqz7awKYS-oSNrIjEAH0yJW3fgKqL9g-vtMuN1XJrQ_fMzuOk7Mlo1W_SqijHMT715XrJMY9kN6VqzwvwBDLNtNw-s2s5PcXmHhWg3mNFlZTiEFnRx6Uqd8BrB_PzyocdklYixVmMfc34osZOMealrvPKya94NA==>More

Dear  Michael Easley,

For those interested in using new technologies for everyday communication with
your citizens, join us for our leading 60-minute audio conference:

"Public Service Technologies: Effectively Communicating with Citizens"
Wednesday, February 11, 2009, 1:00 PM ET
http://www.government-educator.com/7K/0/2/p27CK5c/p1QS7AVMi/p0e

Government organizations are heavily relying on new forms of technology to
communicate with their citizens. How can you provide adequate public service to
your citizens & consistently provide them with community information and
updates?  What are the best strategies for sharing a broad range of information
with your citizens & maintaining everyday communication? Join us for a 60-
minute audio conference where you will discover:

** Keys to Using Your Website to Provide Everyday Service to Your Citizens
** Best Practices for Sharing Program & Event Updates with Your Community
** Using Web 2.0 & Social Networking to Open the Lines of Communication
** Strategies for Strengthening Your Community Using Public Service Technologies

SPEAKER
Joseph Clark is an instructional project manager and faculty member at Florida
State University, where he provides internal consulting and workshops on
instructional technology and online learning as well as other pedagogical
strategies.

**  He holds a Master's in Communication and has previously worked as a web
    designer, including the pioneering of an award-winning website in the early
    days of the web at one of Florida's largest state agencies, with additional
    experience in assessment and technical writing.  Mr. Clark has been
    investigating, promoting, and applying "Web 2.0" applications in higher
    education for several years.
**  He currently teaches "New Communications Technology and Contemporary
    Society" online and is pursuing a Ph.D. in Communication, with research
    interests in emerging Multi-User Virtual Environments and their role in
    communication and education.

Hosted by Government Educator, the leader in fast-read
actionable advice on workplace issues, the audio conference gives you
the opportunity to add immediate, impact to your marketing efforts in a
manner that is:

FAST - No wasted time here. Get right to the heart of the matter in a
1-hour block designed to easily fit into your busy schedule.

CONVENIENT - No airlines. No travel. No time out of the office.
Listen from the comfort and convenience of your desk.

EASY - A telephone is all the equipment you need. Just dial in, punch
in your access code, and you're in. That's it. Follow along with the
audio conference handouts provided in advance.

ACTIONABLE - Our audio conference provides money-saving tactics you can
start using right when you hang up the phone.

IDEAL FOR MULTIPLE LISTENERS - Use a speakerphone and as many people as
you want can listen in - at no extra cost to you. Many professionals
use these sessions as a cost-efficient, time-efficient means of
training supervisors, managers, and staff and reinforcing key
issues in a fresh new manner that they will remember and act on.
