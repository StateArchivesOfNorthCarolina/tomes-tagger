Subject: Save NC money and embarrassment

Comment: hundreds of thousands of dollars are being wasted in Department of Commerce. with the possibility of over $1 million by the end of this year. Some of these cost includes criminal actions taken against employees making complaints. Some of the criminal actions involve members of the Attorney General's office. Some employees may release evidence of bribes paid over the past 8 years for large incentives. The documents are hidden in state government servers. Here is a sample, businesses are required to make a "contribution" that is split in percentages. The Assisant Secretary of Administration works the financial magic through contracts and with the help of the CFO while the CIO and Deputy CIO covers the tracks (along with contractors and "trusted" employees) of electronic communications. Anyone putting the pieces together is then setup and fired. Then AG staff takes care of making sure the employee is no longer credible. Check all the former employees over the past 8 years who had "inappropriate" materials (porn etc.) on their computer etc. Then have Michael King give up other peoples' backup emails documents he has been keeping to protect himself (against Denise Sessoms orders). Last known to be in his bottom desk drawer on CD-Roms and DVD. I will make myself public if I lose my job or they are arrested.

Subject: FAIRNESS IN GOVERNMENT

Comment: 2009-01-11 Gov Purdue, May I get some help with this unfair decision? Thanks, John Radford, LSC //////////////////////////////////////////// STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS COUNTY OF JOHNSTON 06 EDC 1841 JOHN M. RADFORD, JR., Petitioner, v.NORTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, Respondent, )))))))) DECISION THIS MATTER came on for hearing before the undersigned, Joe L. Webster, Administrative Law Judge, on April 19, 2007, in Raleigh, North Carolina. APPEARANCES For Petitioner: Bradley N. Schulz Mast, Schulz, Mast, Johnson & Wells, P.A. Post Office Box 119 Smithfield, North Carolina 27577 For Respondent: Laura E. Crumpler Assistant Attorney General North Carolina Department of Justice P.O. Box 629 Raleigh, North Carolina 27602 ISSUE Whether the Respondent wrongfully denied Petitioner’s request for salary credit for “non-teaching” experience based upon his prior experience as a Revenue Officer I with the North Carolina Department of Revenue. APPLICABLE STATUTES AND RULES Official notice is taken of the following statutes and rules applicable to this case: N.C. Gen Stat. § 150B-23 N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-296 State Board of Education Policy QP-A-006 WITNESS FOR PETITIONER John M. Radford Robbie B. McLamb Lisa Beth Corser WITNESSES FOR RESPONDENT Sheila White Charles David Bennett Ellen Greaves EXHIBITS RECEIVED INTO EVIDENCE Petitioner Exhibits 1-7 were received into evidence. Respondent Exhibits 1-12 were received into evidence. BASED UPON careful consideration of the sworn testimony presented at the hearing and the entire record in this proceeding, the undersigned makes the following: FINDINGS OF FACT 1. Respondent, North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (“DPI”), is charged with the responsibility of licensing professional educators in North Carolina. 2. Teachers in North Carolina are paid on a salary schedule based upon experience level, meaning that a teacher receives a salary increase as his/her experience level increases. The salary schedule incremental increases are based upon both degree level and experience level. 3. Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-295, all teachers employed in the public schools of North Carolina must be certified, or licensed, to teach. North Carolina General Statute §115C-296(a) provides, in pertinent part, as follows: The State Board of Education shall have entire control of certifying all applicants for teaching positions in all public elementary and high schools of North Carolina; and it shall prescribe the rules and regulations for the renewal and extension of all certificates and shall determine and fix the salary for each grade and type of certificate which it authorizes. . . . N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-296(a). 4. Pursuant to its statutory authority to “determine and fix the salary for each grade and type of certificate which it authorizes,” the State Board of Education (hereinafter the “SBE”) has adopted a policy, QP-A-006, entitled “Policies related to Experience/Degree Credit for Salary Purposes.” 5. The policy recognizes that educators employed in the public schools may be awarded salary credit for past employment experience as well as for certain graduate degrees. Generally, the salary credit falls into three main categories: (1) prior experience as a teacher; (2) prior work experience that is non-teaching in nature; and (3) possession of a graduate degree. 6. Respondent employs licensure specialists to evaluate license applications and also to evaluate requests for non-teaching work experience for salary schedule purposes. 7. Licensure specialists are given a three-page policy guide and a general information guide, both of which list North Carolina State Board of Education’s policy on granting experience/degree credit for salary purposes. The documents state how salaries are calculated and who is eligible for the experience/degree credit. 8. In order to be eligible to receive credit for prior “non-teaching” work experience, the prior work experience must meet several criteria. The critical factor for deciding whether to award “non-teaching” work experience credit, however, is whether that prior work experience is “directly related” to an individual’s area of licensure and work assignment. 9. Specifically, QP-A-006 provides, in pertinent part, as follows: Non-teaching work experience shall be defined as professional work experience in public or private sectors that is directly related to an individual’s area of licensure and work assignment. State Board of Education Policy QP-A-006, section 6.20 (emphasis added). 10. Petitioner is currently employed by the Wayne County Public Schools as a Guidance Counselor under a provisional license, and only has four more courses to complete. 11. After beginning employment as a Guidance Counselor in 2005, Petitioner requested credit for past non-teaching work experience. The Local Education Authority recommended that Petitioner receive credit for 16 years. 12. Petitioner’s request for credit was initially denied by members of licensure staff at the Department of Public Instruction. The denial was based upon the Department’s determination that the prior experience was not “directly related” to Petitioner’s area of licensure and teaching assignment. 13. Following this initial denial, and pursuant to SBE Policy QP-A-006, Petitioner’s employer, Wayne County Schools, requested a review by the Experience Credit Appeals Panel. 14. The school system and Petitioner submitted further documentation in support of his request for non-teaching experience credit, including official job descriptions from his Revenue Officer I position, official job description of a school guidance counselor, and Petitioner’s own comparison of his previous job duties with the job duties of school guidance counselor. 15. According to the official job description of the Revenue Officer I, the person in that position: is responsible for resolving complex, high liability delinquent tax cases. The Revenue Officer I must possess comprehensive knowledge of all tax schedules in order to determine tax liability, secure delinquent tax returns, conduct tax investigations, and assist taxpayers with filing delinquent returns. The Revenue Officer I position plays a key role in the Department’s enforcement efforts to enhance taxpayer compliance by educating the public and collecting the State’s General Fund Revenues. 16. The job description divides the duties of the Revenue Officer I into two categories: (1) Research and Enforcement; and (2) Administration of the North Carolina Revenue Laws. 17. Research and Enforcement comprises about 90% of the duties and includes various investigative duties. Petitioner admitted on the stand that, consistent with the job description, he frequently dealt with the Department of Motor Vehicles, with lawyers and clerks of the court, with banks and bank records, and with the Employment Security Commission. Petitioner had to review court tax records and the grantor-grantee indexes in the courthouse. He stated he had to have a working knowledge of accounting concepts, business law and tax schedules. 18. In fact, Petitioner’s prior experience was deemed to be creditable towards his other license area of “business education” and “middle grades business.” The Licensure Section determined that Petitioner’s work as a Revenue Officer I was “directly related” to the area of business education, and awarded him the full 16 years’ experience credit. However, his prior experience as a Revenue Officer I, while related to business, was not related to guidance counseling and was not transferable under the State Board Policy. (“Credit for non-teaching work experience is not transferable to other licensure areas for which the experience is not relevant.” SBE Policy QP-A-006, section 6.20). 19. The purpose of the school guidance counselor, as set forth in the job description, is to “promote student success, provide preventative services, and respond to identified student needs by implementing a comprehensive school counseling program that addresses academic career, and personal/social development for all students.” 20. The school guidance counselor is responsible for interpreting student test data; assisting students in developing academic and career goals; working with parents, the community and students concerning identified concerns and needs; providing individual and group counseling; interacting and communicating with teachers, administrators, and other school personnel; adhering to relevant laws, policies, and procedures; monitoring student academic performance, behavior and attendance; and assists with appropriate intervention. 21. All of the information submitted by Petitioner in support of his request was presented to the Appeals Panel at its September 26, 2006, meeting. The Panel reviewed the material and compared the official job responsibilities of the prior work experience with the Standard Course of Study and job expectations of the position of school guidance counselor. 22. The Panel consists of professional educators, none of whom is employed by the State Board of Education or the Department of Public Instruction. The Panel was created to give another level of review in the process and specifically to permit teachers another opportunity to present information in an objective forum. The Panel is inclined to give the benefit of a doubt to teachers but nevertheless seek to award credit only within the strict letter of the State Board’s policy and to ensure consistency in the process statewide. 23. The Panel here thoroughly reviewed and considered the information submitted, and after deliberating, voted unanimously to deny Petitioner’s request. 24. Two members of the Panel testified at the hearing of this matter. Both stated that, in their opinion, the job duties of the Revenue Officer I were not sufficiently related to the job duties of school guidance counselor to award salary credit. The role of a school guidance counselor involves assessing student test data, dealing with the student’s future plans, working with parents, and assisting students with interpersonal skills. 25. While Petitioner described some job duties that involved working with taxpayers on a personal level, as Respondent’s witnesses pointed out, most employees, especially those in professional capacities, engage in some counseling. 26. Petitioner admitted on the stand that he did not deal with adolescents, did not deal with class schedules, did not deal with testing or scholarships, did not deal with teachers or principals, and was not familiar with school laws. 27. The term “directly related” as used in the State Board Policy at issue here, and as applied by DPI staff and the Panel members, is a term of art that is understood by the licensure staff, by members of the Panel, and by personnel administrators in the local school systems. 28. Licensure staff is trained on the job for six to nine months prior to being permitted to apply the policy without oversight by supervisors. The Panel members worked closely with the policy in earlier attempts to revise portions of it and have had substantial experience in applying it to real situations. The term “directly related,” sometimes used interchangeably with “directly relevant,” describes the process of comparing “what the person was doing in a verifiable way in their [sic] past . . . with the specific responsibilities and knowledge and skills that would be required to fulfill the position in public education.” 29. As stated by Dr. Ellen Greaves, a licensed attorney and educator and member of the Panel, there is no precise formula for determining whether the prior experience is “directly related” to one’s area of licensure and teaching assignment. It is a “situationally contextual understanding.” In this case, the direct relationship did not exist and the Panel voted unanimously to deny the credit. BASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact, the undersigned makes the following: CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 1. The parties are properly before the Office of Administrative Hearings. 2. Petitioner bears the burden of proving the claims alleged in the Petition by a preponderance of evidence. Peace v. Employment Sec. Comm’n., 349 N.C. 315, 507 S.E.2d 272 (1998). 3. The State Board of Education has the constitutional power “to supervise and administer the free public school system and the educational funds provided for its support.” N.C. Const. art IX, § 5. This power includes the power to “regulate the grade [and] salary . . . of teachers.” Guthrie v. Taylor, 279 N.C. 703, 709, 185 S.E.2d 193, 198 (1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 920, 32 L.Ed.2d 119 (1972). The State Board has the specific duty “to certify and regulate the grade and salary of teachers and other school employees.” N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-12(9)a; Guthrie at 711. 4. Finally, the State Board has the statutory authority to “determine and fix the salary for each grade and type of certificate which it authorizes . . . .” N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-296(a). 5. While Petitioner’s duties as a Revenue Officer I were directly related to or relevant to his former position as a business teacher, his duties as a Revenue I Officer were not directly related to or relevant to his new duties as a school Guidance Counselor. 6. In reaching this determination the court relies upon the testimony of individuals with years of experience in applying the policy and the uninterrupted interpretation of that policy over the years. This court may rely upon consistent interpretation by a State Agency of its own statutes and policies in reaching a conclusion with regard to the application of a particular policy to a given set of facts. See State v. Jones, 358 N.C. 473, 598 S.E.2d 125 (2004); Frye Regional Medical Center, Inc. v. Hunt, 350 N.C. 39, 510 S.E.2d 159 (1999). Moreover, the agency’s interpretation of its own policies is controlling unless it is plainly erroneous. Morrell v. Flaherty, 338 NC 230, 237, 449 S.E.2d 175, 179-80 (1994). 7. Petitioner has not met his burden of demonstrating that Respondent has deprived him of property or has otherwise substantially prejudiced his rights and that Respondent has: (1) Exceeded its authority; (2) Acted erroneously; (3) Failed to use proper procedure; (4) Acted arbitrarily or capriciously; or (5) Failed to act as required by law or rule. DECISION The undersigned recommends that the State Board of Education affirm the decision of the Department to deny the Petitioner the relief requested. ORDER AND NOTICE The Agency that will make the final decision in this contested case is the North Carolina State Board of Education. The Agency is required to give each party an opportunity to file exceptions to the recommended decision and to present written arguments to those in the Agency who will make the final decision. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 150-36(a). The Agency is required by N.C. Gen. Stat. § 150B-36(b) to serve a copy of the final decision on all parties and to furnish a copy to the parties’ attorney of record and to the Office of Administrative Hearings. In accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. § 150B-36 the Agency shall adopt each finding of fact contained in the Administrative Law Judge’s decision unless the finding is clearly contrary to the preponderance of the admissible evidence. For each finding of fact not adopted by the agency, the agency shall set forth separately and in detail the reasons for not adopting the finding of fact and the evidence in the record relied upon by the agency in not adopting the finding of fact. For each new finding of fact made by the agency that is not contained in the Administrative Law Judge’s decision, the agency shall set forth separately and in detail the evidence in the record relied upon by the agency in making the finding of fact.

Subject: Independent contrctors

Comment: ****IMPORTANT:**** I expect strict confidence in this matter due to possible reprecussions. I meet every afternoon for coffee and drinks with a group of 10-15 local business men. Of course, we solve all political problems on a daily basis. We discuss national, state and local news and give our opinions. We have, for the past several months been discussing deficit spending and the problems our economies are having. We have one person that boasts he is paid $400 a day as a contractor under contract with the NC State Medicare program. He is a programmer. It bothers me because he also boosts that he mostly does word puzzles and plays computer games most of his working time. He says there is nothing for him to do since the state has been trying to decide who was to get the Medicare bid. Wednesday he boasted he changed vendors and asked how much the previous vendor was paid for his services. He was shocked when he was given that dollar amount. He asked for a raise with the new vendor and was given a $12 an hour raise to over $60 and hour. ****Again, I do not want my name brought up in this matter and will refuse any questioning.**** I simply think, with the current economy, this payment to a contractor is rediculious. I am sure he isn't the only contractor making this kind of money. I can't blame him for asking this kind of money but I can blame the State of NC for paying this kind of money for a vendor/contractor when there are hundreds of out of work citizen programmers who would love to have a job with the State making, say $25/hr or $52,000 as opposed to paying a contractor $62/hr or $128,960 a year to play computer games. He also boosts that he and some of his programmer friends will probably be hired for even more money by the company who just got the Medicare contract. When asked if he doesn't owe the State his loyalty and stay on with the State he laughts and says "that's their loss".

Subject: help Stop Companies Bankrupt Disabled People

Comment: I need help! I am a 60year-old male that has been disabled since Jan. 2002.When I became disabled I worked for Federal Mogul (FM) an automotive supplier. I was the Manager of Design Engineering. I asked FM everal times for a copy of the company disability policies and procedures. After 3years they gave me a copy finally at the same time they told me that they that they had over paid me $66,497.00 this was on Jan 27,2005.They said that they were stopping all my benifits until I paid this money back. The reason that they said I was over paid this time was because I did not inform them of my Soc.Sec. acceptance letter. (I have documentation that shows I did exactly what I was directed to do.)I had to get a lawyer to get them to agree to take only half of my disability pay so that I would not loose everything. The only reason they agreed was because they knew that they should have given me my disability policy within 90days of my becomeing disabled. (NOT 3 YEARS).FM sent me and my attorney a spread sheet that stated the overpayment would be paid off in Dec. 2008. This was not the first time they told me that I was overpaid. On Feb.18,2003 they stopped my benifits until I paid them back $2,184.44. Which they said was because they paid me 65% of my pay and I was only supposed to get 60%. (I have several letters from FM that states I was to get 65%, and besides how was I to know they would not give me a copy of the policies!!) On July 6, 2005 Metlife insurance co. (in 2005 FM turned my case over to MetLife to manage) sent me a letter that stated that they had over paid me $443.56 because they thought I was to get 65% of my income. I had to pay this back to resume my one half benifit. I received a letter from Metlife that stated the overpayment would be paid off in Feb. 2009 not Dec. 2008. I started questioning this in Sep 2008 because I didn't understand why. I have paid 4.04 years as stated in the spread sheet. Then metlife said it would not be paid off until July 2009. they could not tell me why so I continued to question metlife for 4 months. They sent me from one department to another. Finally in Nov. 2008 they told me that I was paid up and would start getting my full benifit starting Nov 2008. When I didn't get my full benifit I called again. They told me Now they are going ALL THE WAY BACK TO 2002 AND TAKING ALL OF MY COST OF LIVING INCREASE THAT I HAD RECIEVED FROM SOC. SEC. and that they will continue to take out as much as they deam appropriate!! I have talked to several attorneys and they all say the the law is on the side of the large companies and it will cost me a lot of money to fight it! How Can this be allowed? I am almost bankrupt because of this. I have had to barrow money from my children to buy food and pay my bills. I have sent a 5 page letter to President Obama, I have sent letters in the past to my congressman with no responce and a letter to Senator Dole and she sent it to the Labor Board who said that they could not help. I am getting desprate and have sent it to some of the News Papers with no responce. It seems that no one cares about the disabled in this country. HOW CAN THIS INJUSTICE BE ALLOWED? PLEASE HELP ME and I know if they are doing this to me they have to be doing it to others. P.S. Ihave documentation to back up everything I am telling you. Hope to hear from you soon. Paul Goad

Subject: disable veteran

Comment: Dear Sir/ Mam, Hello my mane is Milton Cummings Jr. I am a retired disable combat veteran. I was writing because I experienced something in my life last week that other people and myself felt that was wrong. I was put into Hoke County Jail on January 12, 2009 thru January 15, 2009, because of a social worker from Hoke County Department of Social Services not doing her job. I filed a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy on June 27, 2008 witch is a consolidation of all your dept. My attorney John T. Orcutt sent the Hoke County DSS the paper work on June 29, 2008 to fill out for my back child support to get the money from my trustee. Instead of filling out the paper work Hoke County DSS took out an Order For Arrest in September 2008. Hoke County tried to make it look like I was not trying to get it caught up and not trying to pay it, but I did everything in my power to fix this. My attorney contacted Hoke County DSS numbers of times and they still never fixed it. I had to spend a week of my life in jail and lose a week of my life away from my wife, kids and I will never get it back. I suffer from PTSD, Seizure Disorder, Mood Swings, Depression, and Lumbar Spinal Condition. I take medications for all my disorders, but while I was in Hoke County Jail the nurse would not give me any of my medication she told me I had to be seen by her. With my disorders I don't like being around other people and don't like talking to new people either. The Hoke County Jail didn't listen to anything I had to say and they refused to give me my medications. I was not able to eat or drink anything the whole time I was in jail because the way my body felt without my medication my Veterans Affairs doctors have gave me. Because of me having PTSD and everything that comes with it they made me take off all my clothes and put on like a safety dress and I was not allowed socks or under ware. The first night I didn't even have a blanket it took one of the other in-mates getting a blanket for me. After that I was not given the chance to brush my teeth, to take a shower, and was not even given toilet paper to use the bathroom. Hoke County Jail also had a camera watching my 24 hours a day. By the end of my stay at Hoke County Jail my wife was calling and doing everything she could do to get this fixed but no one would listen to her either. I even took all of my paper work with me to jail to show them what action we took to fix this. On the 15th January 2009 a LT came to my sail and said I should have never been put in jail because of my Chapter 13 and in less then 10 min. he had me out of the door. He knew they were wrong for what they had done and I don't want this to happen to another veteran like it did to me. I don't thank anyone should have to stay in jail because of someone else not wanting to do there job. Thank you, Milton Cummings Jr. Retired Disable Combat Veteran

Subject: MILITARY BENIFITS

Comment: I have copied and pasted an e-mail I recieved and am trying to confirm if it is true. It is under Chapter 9, Option 96. They are trying to screw us even more. Give us a raise and take it away with the other hand. Looks like our future pres is about to put the screws to the military retirees. The veterans will be next, then the active duty military. Heads Up, The Fight For Our TriCare Heath Care... is on the front burner to be cut... We all need to get involved with this, if we don't we all will be at fault. Please read everything below. Thank you Dean and others that send me items to pass on to all of the rest of the MilVets that are on this list. Subject: FW: TriCare for Life's Future Date: Thu, 8 Jan 2009 09:14:10 -0800 To All, This is for real. The heavy assault has begun on Veterans'/Retirees' benefits to pay for other programs. The word on the street is that these indeed are a high priority of the Obama administration. The one most of interest to Retired Military is in Article 189. If approved by Congress the first assault wave would hit the beaches in 2011 and would hit hard. It would initiate cost sharing to require retirees to pay the first $525 of medical cost and 50% of the next $4,725 for a first year cost of $2,888 per person. It would be indexed to increase with inflation. A reason given for this action (for PR effect) is "overuse" by Retirees. Clyde ________________________________ For those of you who are covered by TFL you will want to pay attention to what BG Bob Clements has surfaced about the future of TFL. If you know of anyone who is Retired Military, please forward this on to them. I don't know how many of you partake of the TriCare for Life program but here is a very interesting note on the subject. Seems as though our President Elect has placed a priority on cutting it out of the budget as a means to provide funding for those things he promised during the campaign. In any case, on page 189 of the Congressional Budget Office report, see the note below on how to get to that spot, there is a strong recommendation to eventually eliminate the program as it is too expensive. I would ask that you contact your elected officials and register your strong opposition to the elimination of this program. Just another move to slight those of us who dedicated much of our adult lives to the defense of our country. Thanks for listening.

Comment: In speaking for some members of the community of Harlowe, NC, we beg for assistance in dealing with the ever growing and overwhelming problem of illegal drug use. Our church community has been in discussion and we have a strong desire to "take back" our community. The truth be known, the drug problems in and around Harlowe are bigger than the local sheriffs departments of Carteret and Craven County. We have sent an e-mail to help@drugfreenc.org but we need as much attention to this situation as possible. Please advise.

Subject: Gang Activity in African American Communities

Comment: Hello Govenor, I know that you are getting settled in, and alot of issues are hitting you hard. Govenor Perdue my name is Michael Jones, and I am an African American residing in the Apex township of Wake County. Govenor it is time that a change comes to African American Community. This change has to start by focusing on getting young men out of and helping them to avoid getting caught up in gang activity. I never knew why I moved to this area, but the other day I was a victim of crime, by a gang member. He didn't hurt anyone but he stole precious goods from my family and I. How do I respond do I press charges and have him put in jail and this will cause him to be more angry or do I seek to make a difference seek to speak purpose and destiny into the lives of these young men. Govenor I need your help I'm willing to work if I get the assets. I know that we can work together to guarantee the safety of the people of this state, and the country. Please contact me about this issue it is time for a change in the African American community. If we seek peace and pursue I believe will find it.

Subject: THE LAW!

In light of the declaration by Chatham Co commissioners, are the breaking this law by not complying? GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF NORTH CAROLINA SESSION 2007 SESSION LAW 2007-494 SENATE BILL 229 AN ACT TO DETERMINE THE RESIDENCY STATUS OF PERSONS JAILED ON FELONY OR DRIVING WHILE IMPAIRED CHARGES. The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts: SECTION 1. Chapter 162 of the General Statutes is amended by adding a new section to read: "§ 162-62. Legal status of prisoners. (a) When any person charged with a felony or an impaired driving offense is confined for any period in a county jail, local confinement facility, district confinement facility, or satellite jail/work release unit, the administrator or other person in charge of the facility shall attempt to determine if the prisoner is a legal resident of the United States by an inquiry of the prisoner, or by examination of any relevant documents, or both. (b) If the administrator or other person in charge of the facility is unable to determine if that prisoner is a legal resident or citizen of the United States or its territories, the administrator or other person in charge of the facility holding the prisoner, where possible, shall make a query through the Division of Criminal Information (DCI) system to the Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC) of Immigration and Customs Enforcement of the United States Department of Homeland Security. If the LESC determines that the prisoner has not been lawfully admitted to the United States, the United States Department of Homeland Security will have been notified of the prisoner's status and confinement at the facility by its receipt of the DCI query from the facility. (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to deny bond to a prisoner or to prevent a prisoner from being released from confinement when that prisoner is otherwise eligible for release. (d) The administrator or other person in charge of the facility shall annually report the number of queries performed under subsection (b) of this section and the results of those queries to the Governor's Crime Commission of the Department of Crime Control and Public Safety. The Governor's Crime Commission shall make the reports available to the public." Page 2 Session Law 2007-494 SL2007-0494 SECTION 2. This act becomes effective January 1, 2008.

All he is asking why TRA can't pay his unemployment if he pays for ITT.They pay if you go to a comunity tech so what would be the differance ?they wouldn't be paying for his schooling like they pay for all those that go to comunity tech.That sounds like they are helping the comunities rather than people .

Subject: An Unimagineable Story

Comment: Dear Mrs. Purdue, My name is Mary Caldwell, a neighbor of the victim of an unbelievable accident. I am desperately trying to help Tanzea first with financial needs and as much emotional support as possible. Tanzea cannot imagine how her life is possible with her new disabilities. As you read her story it is unimaginable how much worse her situation has been made by such a broken medical/legal system. Please help me tell Tanzea's story. She is lying in her hospital bed in her sister's basement and cannot remember what day was the last time she was out of that bed for anything. How is this story possible in America. This accident happened here by a careless North Carolinian driver. How can North Carolina not help her? I would like to send a petition with a picture of georgous Tanzea is. I am circulating it for donations and volunteers to nominate her for Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. An account has been set up in her name for listener's donation's to get her an accessible van. Tanzea Mahbuba is a beautiful 26 year old young woman who had everything to live for until June 12, 2008. It was that day that she was a victim of a tragic accident and an even more tragic victim of a broken system. Tanzea was sleeping in her bed at her Windsong Court Apartment in Winston-Salem, when a pick-up truck crashed into her apartment striking her in her own bed. This accident left Tanzea a high level quadriplegic. Tanzea is paralyzed below her upper chest. She can move her arms but cannot move her hands. She was self-employed and had limited insurance and the driver was also poorly insured. Her insurance company required that she be discharged after only one month of rehabilitation. She does not have respite care or nursing support. Her mother had to leave her husband to move here from Bangladesh to care for Tanzea. She is living in her sister’s house which was already crowded with their family. Tanzea is trapped in the basement literally unable to get to the main level of the house. There is no bathroom on that level and Tanzea has not been able to take a shower or bath since the accident. She is only able to take sponge baths for which her mother is responsible. Tanzea is receiving limited occupational therapy but nothing else. She has a loaner power chair, but not one prescribed to her. She does not have an accessible van. This means that Tanzea has to call the Yvette van for each of her appointments. Not yet receiving Medicaid, the van cost $100.00 out of Tanzea’s pocket. She is canceling appointments due to the cost of getting to her appointments. She has a standard mattress on her hospital bed, not the specialized mattress that is designed for spinal cord injuries. Therefore, she has developed decubitus ulcers at her pressure points, commonly known as bed sores. Most of us believe that when you are a victim of such a horrific accident that at least you will be well compensated financially. This is NOT the case for Tanzea. Her lawyers have told her that likely the settlement will not exceed $35,000.00. The settlement will likely take four years to complete and fall very short of covering the costs that she has already incurred much less any future costs which are inevitable with a spinal cord injury. Tanzea is understandably extremely depressed. Despite that, it is her responsibility to learn this broken system and advocate for herself. How can this be? In the United States of America, an innocent person is victimized by a careless driver and then again by the broken medical/legal system. This is not how we should treat any human being in her situation. She was sleeping in her bed, how much more innocent can you be? She has lost everything, and no one is responsible and no one is assigned to help make it better. If this is not enough, Tanzea cannot receive Medicaid because she is not a US citizen. The only reason that she is not already a citizen is because she cannot get to Charlotte to complete the interview and recite the oath due to her injury and severe disability. Please help her by donating money to help cover the cost of a used handicapped accessible van. A relief fund has been set up in her name at Wachovia. I will also be nominating her for an Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. I will be circulating the attached petition to show your support for Tanzea and sign up also to be a volunteer if you would like to participate in the construction of a home for her should she be chosen for the show. Tanzea is an ultimate victim and we should not turn away from her. She desperately needs everyone’s help. I believe that the only reason that she is in this situation is because our community does not know her story. I know that if everyone knew that they can help her, they would.

Subject: Upset Citizen

Comment: I wanted to voice my total disappointment in the legal system of this state. Not only have I been totally victimize by it but the people that are breaking the laws of this state are getting away with it and it severely upsets me. I rented a place in Nash county back in August 2007, did what I was supposed to do and paid my security deposit and rent. I ran into tough times like we all have and my landlord was nice enough to understand when the rent wasn't paid on time, but it was always paid and all late fees were paid. In fact I even went further and paid an additional $100.00 for the trouble that we had been. Later I found a better job, but not one close to home and with the rising gas prices I decided it was better if I found something closer to my job. I did everything by the letter of the law, I gave her 30 day notice, I paid the partial rent for the 6 days into the month since my 30 days notice would put me 6 days into the next month. I even spent an entire day on my hands and knees making sure the place I was leaving was in better condition than when I first moved into it. I wait 30 days and nothing from my previous landlord. I wait 3 more days since I gave her the keys on the 3rd of the month but paid until the 6th of the month. I got nothing from my previous landlord, so I sent a letter by email and certified mail stated I wanted the return of my security deposit. Only then did I receive a letter 3 days later that was backdated stating a list of damages on the residence. Shocked at this I looked up state law and found that she lost all rights to the deposit after 30 days so I proceeded to explain how if she didn't return my deposit I would be forced to take it to small claims court. Her response to this was filing bankruptcy. Now here I am a mother of two girls whose father fails to pay his child support and not only does North Carolina do nothing about it but Virginia, where he resides, does nothing about it. I live on a limited income and even had to borrow that security deposit from my mother to be able to acquire the place. Now I have a previous landlord that not only broke the state law by not putting it in a savings, trust or escrow (obviously since she doesn't have it), but she also fails to return it and then has it cleared by filing bankruptcy. So why should I have any faith in the justice system of this state at all? Beth Harrison

It had great potential for development as a secured research, learning, health and environmental study 'campus' with the potential for long-term residents. I saw it while living in NC in 2007. I was born in NC, and I literally cringed at the loss of such magnificient 21st century potential. All I saw were 'demolition' notices - I would have 'moved in' in a minute if the 'living quarters' had been habitable. Why didn't anyone think of going solar for those small living quarters already outfitted with in-floor hot water heat? Why didn't anyone think of keeping them small and going to a unique 21st century leading health opportunity?

Subject: NC Constitution

Comment: Article VI, Sec. 8 of the North Carolina State Constitution states: The following persons shall be disqualified for office: First, any person who shall deny the being of Almighty God. I, as well as many others, find this to be blatant discrimination against anyone that does not fall into a particular religion. Please explain how someone that denies “Almighty God” is any less qualified to hold office. This should be fixed to represent all North Carolinians regardless of religious affiliation. Brian Waite

Dear Governor:
As a follow up to my request, I'd like to share with you a bit more in detail about what is going on here in Southport, NC.

Take a look at this link to the front page story showing US Representative Mike McIntyre's recent visit to Southport, and his quote.

<http://www.stateportpilot.com/pages/home.html>http://www.stateportpilot.com/pages/home.html?<http://www.stateportpilot.com/pages/home.html>

The headlines quotes him as stating "Small business is what drives this country".... yet if you turn in the same addition of the newspaper to page 12A, you will find an article clearly reported that states if this proposed annexation takes place in Southport, that several small businesses will be forced to close down, incomes will be lost, elderly and veterans on fixed incomes will be displaced, and yet the decision is scheduled for today.

<http://ee.stateportpilot.com/edition/edition/?haspdf=1>http://ee.stateportpilot.com/edition/edition/?haspdf=1

Please read this article... and let us know what can be done to stop this.

Violation of State Law (47F & 55A) , Articles, Declaration, Bylaws, Rules of Order, Civil and Constitutional Rights In A Public Meeting.

Dear Governor Purdue:



Just as government legislators failed to regulate companies that benefited from sub-prime mortgages; the absence of a regulatory agency in our State is allowing home owner associations, their management companies, and police to abuse home owners and trample over their civil and constitutional rights.



Every since February 15, 2007 I wanted to know what my home owner’s association dues were being spent on and see proof in the form of receipts or invoices.  I wanted to see proof because budgets approved and actual expenditures reported were questionable.  I didn’t think it was unreasonable especially since I lived in the community, was a member of the association, and paid dues.  I would never see that information regardless of how much the following State laws and Association rules gave me a right to access it:     



· State of North Carolina General Statute - Chapter 47F - North Carolina Planned Community Act § 47F‑3‑118 (a)  “…shall be made reasonably available….”



· GS Article 16 - Chapter § 55A‑16‑02. Inspection of records by members.  “…A member is entitled to inspect and copy….”



· Stillwood Property Owner Association’s (POA) Declaration - Section K of Article 15 General Provisions.  “The Association shall make available for inspection upon request… Documents and the books, records and financial statements ofAssociation to Residential Owners.”



* Stillwood POA’s Bylaws § 11.1 “…which shall be open to inspection by Members…Such records shall include but not be limited to: (i) a record of all receipts and expenditures….” 


I have requested but not seen or been given access to invoices and receipts.  My request have been repeatedly ignored even though State Law, our Covenant, and Bylaws make it clear that I must be given access to it.



What board members and the associations’ management company did do is become hostile, generate false police incident reports, instruct the police to harass (witnessed);  and violate my civil and constitutional rights, even though I abided by and made requests in accordance with State Law, Covenants, By-laws, and Rules of Order. 



The main report and its attachments provide details relating to how it was done, and clearly presents in detail why we need to prevent this from happening on a larger more abusive scale, especially during a period when nationally and internationally, people are facing difficult economic times; as a result of legislators failing to regulate the people and companies that benefited from sub-prime mortgage investment tools. 



Attorneys will not represent you in such matters, especially if you don’t have money to pay up-front, at the tune of $250.00 per hour!  Further, how many people have the time to take off work, to go to court, when they’re struggling just trying to keep their job!  Under such circumstances it is the duty of State Legislators and the Federal Government to step up and protect citizens that don’t have the financial resources of a business entity.  It’s a call that needs to be heard and acted upon before it gets worst - home owners need help!

I am a concerned Anson County resident. On Wednesday, February 11th 2009, there were at least two incidences, that I am aware of, that occurred that afternoon. Two different people, at two different locations were bought into the police department for possible DWI’s. Neither one blew enough to be charged with DWI’s. Both drivers had passengers that were left on the side of the road. Also both vehicles were towed in by R&R Towing Services. The owner of this company was ugly to both of these individuals. To make this story short and to get to the point that I want the resident’s of Anson County to be aware of is this. When I asked one of the officer’s at the Police Department where to recover the vehicle, he gave me directions and made the statement that the vehicle would be okay because the owner of that company also worked for the Police Department. The owner is Robert Mims. Upon investigating this, I found out that he does currently work for the
 Wadesboro Police Department. Is it just me or is this not a conflict of interest? How many vehicles may have been towed in at the Police Department’s request that this individual/employee has benefited from. Neither one of these individuals asked for their vehicles to be towed and both had someone left on the side of the road that could have stayed with these vehicles until other arrangements were made. Furthermore, I know of incidences where people I know couldn’t get a county job because they were related to one of the employees. Now, please tell me how this is different? Is it fair for an  employee of the city/county to get its contract work?

Thanks,
Amy Whittington

Comment: My parents have raised five children and never have they had such difficult times as they have in the last 2 years. But now they are about to lose their home and there is not much I can do to help them. My dad has turned in 60-70 job applications. He was a self employed mason. A very very talented mason. But there is no work in that field now. But he can't even find any kind of job. What suggestions do you have to such a situation. A year from now will be to long to wait for our economy to strengthen. They will have nothing left in the next few months, if it continues in this mannner. What are other people doing? What is our government going to do for the lower class for those who are in poverty?

Subject: wrongly accused family members

Comment: Ms. Perdue, My name is Loretta Mayhew on Dec.27th 2008, my 2 nephews were made examples of by the Mooresville N.C. police department. The arrested my 2 nephews which by the way are brothers. They are my sisters 2 boys. One is 18 and the other is 19. They are wonderful boys.They have been charged with 14 crimes they did not commit. The family is distraught and we don't know what to do. So I decided to write you. They have been in custody for a total of 45 days. My 18 year old is missing school he is supposed to graduate this year. The 19 year old has a small child to care for he has not seen in 45 days. This is an injustice to me. They're bond is so high we, the family can not make it. We hired an attorney which cost us a total of 2500 dollars. He could'nt help them. Ms. Perdue I would ask that you would help us in this so we can get them home and start preparing for they're defense. They did not do what they are accused of doing and they should be innocent until proven guilty. The judge they stood before on Feb. 10th 2009. stated that very same thing before stating they are a danger to the community. They have never been incarcerated, and this is the first time they have been accused of something. I just don't understand, It's like they have commited murder or worst. They have been other cases that the state have allowed the accused to come home. Why not them ? Please Ms. Perdue help me bring them home.

Comment: Governor, I appreciate you reading my letter. I was wondering what you are personally doing for North Carolinians that are finacially struggling? My husband and I have 2 small children that we are trying very hard to support. It seems as though we are unable to get any assistance from the government. We continue to give our tax money to these big companies that do not forgive our debts. These big companies continue to charge late fees and raise the interest rates to an unbelievable amount. With the entire economy struggling, why are these companies not forced to be more forgiving since they are receiving our money? I am out of a job and my husbands hours have been cut in half. We are doing the best we can to provide the essentials for our children. The government has got to step in and help the middle class people out that have hit a financial disaster. Thank you for reading my letter. As a side note, I do not agree with abortion. I hope that this administration doesn't support it. Bless you, Heather Small

Comment: Why was office space leased in Charlotte? In this climate of economic turmoil and especially when NC (from the news reports anyway)is looking for ways to cut the budget, it seems like an unnecessary expense. In fact, it tells me that here we have another person in government who really does not care.

Subject: Public Assistance

Comment: Bev Perdue, I am a citizen of NC and have been most of my life. My husband and I have a small business and we require our employees to take a drug test before employment. Can you imagine the money our state could save if all the people on public assistance had to take a drug test before they received a check and food stamps from our tax dollars. The majority of this states recipients live in a nice home and drive Mercedes Benz. I see them at the grocery store and they eat better than the people that are working and struggling to keep their jobs and pay the bills. I would really like to know your oppoinion on this not one of your secretary', or staff members. Some of our employees have had their hours reduced and or laid off because of the economy. I feel like if they receive a check and help from our tax dollars than let them work for it, by cleaning our roadsides, our public buildings, anything that our tax dollars are having to pay for. Just imagine our state could save some serious money and maybe even get out of debt. Please respond to me and not one of your people. Thanks Linda Langley

Subject: Yadkin River and Alcoa license

Comment: Governor- I urge, I beg you and the State NOT to renew the license for Alcoa to manage the power systems of the Yadkin River. Even if they are found to have played no role in polluting Badin Lake, from a purely economic perspective, Alcoa no longer plays a role in providing jobs to North Carolina citizens which was the original intent of granting the license. Surely there must be some other company, Duke Energy or PSNC perhaps, that at least provides jobs to North Carolina citizens. Alcoa moved it's smelting facilities to Iceland and cost the jobs of many of our own residents. They should not be rewarded for such behavior, regardless of when it took place.

Subject: North Carolina Move Over Law

Comment: Governor Bev Perdue, I am writing to get your support for public education of the Move Over Law. On November 25, 2008 while working as a firefighter I was struck by a motorist who fail to follow the Move Over Law. I sustained major damage to my right knee, which will remove me from my normal job duties for at least nine months. After my accident three other firefighters were struck by another motorist who did not follow the Move Over Law. The public needs to be educated more about the importance of this law. I am asking for you assistance in obatining any grants that would cover such education. Also any other contacts you have that could help in this much needed project. Governor Perdue please take a moment to consider how many lives could be saved, and injuies prevented by getting the message out to the public. Thank you for your time and consideration.

I just thought I would let someone in government know that is a very daunting task to get NC license plates. On top of the ridiculous paper work needed there is also a $217 fee attached to this process. I am not sure where or how that money is spent but to common sense it seems absurd. In addition to it all is the fact that the license office does not take credit cards, so in order to pay this fee I need a loan, and although I work 40 hours a week and have a steady job, the banks will not provide such a personal loan. This seems to be a typical case of the little guy getting worked over. Thanks for your time.

Washington NEWS
Cuba Farm Trade Barrier Targeted: Farm-state members of Congress are trying once again to force the executive branch of the government to remove barriers to sales of wheat, rice and other U.S. agricultural products to Cuba. Rep. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., and 17 other members have introduced the Agricultural Export Facilitation Act of 2009, legislation that would eliminate the requirement that those products be paid for by the Cuban government prior to shipment. The Moran bill, H.R. 1737, would permit direct payments between Cuban and U.S. financial institutions, a change that would permit U.S. exporters to receive payments within hours instead of days and will eliminate an unnecessary transaction fee.

Legislative NEWS
Smoking Ban Passes NC House: Smoking would be banned in restaurants and other businesses where minors are present, but bars could still allow customers to puff away while drinking their pilsner, under a bill approved by the House Thursday. The House voted 72-45 to approve the measure and send it to the Senate, where its chances of passage appear good. The House on Wednesday narrowed the smoking ban's scope from a version that would have forbidden smoking from all workplaces, including bars and restaurants. The measure now would ban smoking in businesses that employ or serve anyone under age 18, but not to most other businesses that post signs at the doorway that smoking is allowed. Fraternal and veterans' clubs would be exempt from the smoking ban. Counties and cities could impose even tighter restrictions.
Water Use Legislation: Water rights in North Carolina may soon undergo dramatic changes that could include requirements for permits for large users and the creation of regional planning organizations to manage the supply of water in individual river basins. The permit requirements and regional water planning are part of legislation filed by Sen. Dan Clodfelter, D-Mecklenburg, last week. Clodfelter said on Tuesday that the bill may not be taken up by a Senate committee for several weeks. He said legislative staff members are collecting comments from people interested in the legislation. The bill would require that water users who use more than 100,000 gallons a day from surface waters or groundwater obtain a permit from state regulators which would set limits on withdrawals. It would also give the General Assembly the power to set up regional planning organizations, whose members could include current water system operators, to plan and manage water supplies in individual river basins.
House Panel OKs Anti-OLF Bill: A bill aimed at deterring the U.S. Navy from building an outlying landing field in northeastern North Carolina passed its first hurdle Tuesday, as a House committee signed off on the legislation. The 15-member House Judiciary Committee unanimously approved the bill, which requires the federal government to seek state permission before acquiring land to build a jet landing strip in a county where an existing military base with aircraft squadrons doesnt already exist. Neither Camden nor Gates County  the two sites in North Carolina the Navy is studying as potential OLF sites  has a military base.

Commodity NEWS
More Hogs Now, Fewer Later: USDA's quarterly Hogs and Pigs report issued Friday showed more hogs kept for marketing than expected, but fewer kept for breeding, leading analysts to call the report bearish for hog prices in the short term, but bullish in the long term. USDA reported 59.4 million hogs kept for marketing, a 2.7 percent decline from a year ago, but 0.5 percent more than the market was expecting. It reported 6 million sows kept for breeding, nearly 1 percent fewer than analysts predicted. Even with fewer hogs kept for breeding, however, the number of hogs saved per litter continued to climb, making analysts nervous about how much real reduction in hog production will result. USDA reported 9.48 pigs saved per litter in the December-February period, up 2.6 percent from a year ago and nearly 1 percent higher than analysts expected.

 Effects of a Community College Program for Probationary Students

Rates of graduation and degree completion at community colleges remain distressingly low. This report evaluates two versions of a program designed to help probationary students at community college succeed in school. One version increased the average number of credits earned, the proportion of students who earned a grade point average of C or higher, and the proportion who moved off probation.

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Dear Governor Perdue:



I am writing to you in reference to the situation of the Baldwin family and, more specifically, of Ryan Michael Baldwin, a young child, from Black Mountain, Buncombe County, North Carolina.

Ryan is medically disabled and has a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)(2004), severe autonomic dysfunction (2005), a progressive heart conduction system block (LBBB) with right axis deviation (2008), and mitochondrial disease (2008).



He has been to Johns Hopkins (2004), the Mayo Clinic (2005), the Cleveland Clinic (2006), and was being referred to UNC Chapel Hill for mitochondrial disease (2008) when the Buncombe County NC Department of Social Services (DSS) interfered with all his medical care and, upon an anonymous physician referral, decided to remove Ryan from his home and place him in foster care; the Buncombe County DSS also took his power wheelchair, which he used daily to conserve energy.


Despite these serious confirmed medical diagnoses and wonderful care from his parents, Lisa and Rodney Baldwin, the Buncombe County DSS has charged his parents with child abuse under the Factitious Disorder by Proxy (FDP) (formerly known as Munchausen Disorder by Proxy) under the North Carolina statutes.

It seems that in this particular case this statute was used due to a lack of understanding among many authorities as to the serious nature of CFS and current objective medical research on the illness. Children afflicted with CFS are quite ill. They require ongoing medical treatment and supportive assistance from their families.

Child abuse is a serious charge to be levied against any family or individual, specially under FDP, and we are cognizant of the mission and great responsibility that Ms. Amanda Stone of DSS has in order to ensure the safety of children in Buncombe County.

I do not live in North Carolina but North Dakota. I am tied to this case as a mother of a child with a similar condition. We too have gone through our round of doctors and now doctor at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. We too have been through the heartaches of dis-believing doctors and poor diagnosis but we are past that now. Our local doctor, our schools all accept my daughters condition as real.Even the state here accepts her condition.She has Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, a dysautonomia. It was a long tough road to get people to accept her condition but never ever was our child taken away from us.

Please re consider and return Michael to his parents immediately. I am afraid if I was in the Baldwin's position I would be in jail for I would never let anyone take our girl away. I do not know if you are a mom or not but you have a mom and know the love a mom has for their child. Please restore this family! Thank you for listening.

Sincerely,

Nell McPhillips

Dear Governor Perdue, I am taking the liberty of attaching a letter that I am sending to newspapers, as well as to national and state government officials. My concern is the selection, procedures and maintenance of our North Carolina Medical Board. If even one worthy physician is denied the right to continue to practice and aid his patients because of dubious decisions by the NCMB, that would be serious, but if the boards decisions affect dozens of careers and lives of physicians and their patients, that would be a tragedy. I urge you to create an oversight board to review the NCMB s decisions. This review/oversight body should be comprised of impartial persons who make sure that the defendants defense is completely explored, as well as allowing for complete patient input and the testimony of peer experts from outside the state, if necessary, if helpful to the defense. Patients lives and doctors careers hang in the balance of this board, and therefore it is imperative that we citizens of NC assure ourselves that every precaution is exercised by the NCMB in seeking complete truth while investigating the practices of defending NC physicians. Thank you for taking this under advisement. Phillip Crant, Ph.D.

This is Governor Perdue



I have a personal question regarding the reforming a person once they are released from prison



I have a nephew who was incarcerated for 2 years due to drugs. He has been out for 2 months now and his restitution fee is around 500.00 a month in addition a probation fee of 30.00. His name is Shannon Woodruff and he lives in Yadkinville. Hes a good person and the community speaks very highly of him. However, he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He broke the law. My question is how do you reform a person in this situation? He started looking for a job before his release. My parents who are senior citizens are on a fixed income pay these fees for him because he is unable to fine work. This is taking a lot from my parents who wouldnt have it any other way if it means keeping him out of jail.



If these fees are not paid he goes back to jail. He is willing and able to work. His patrol officer is trying to assist but the economy is so tight and worse for those with a criminal record. Is it possible to get the restitution fee reduced? Any solution will be helpful. I just cant see him going back to jail and the state supporting him. He is really getting frustrated and feels he has not only let society & family down but himself. This incident has taught him a great lesson. Now we need to find away to get not only him but others reformed. If you have any referrals it will be greatly appreciative.



Please feel free to contact me by phone after 4: at 919-599-4281. You may also contact him by email <mailto:shannonwoofdruff@rockmail.com>shannonwoofdruff@rockmail.com or phone 336817-4612.

Governor Breaks Ground on First Economic Recovery Highway Project

Gov. Bev Perdue was joined by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti andlocal elected officials in Camden County at a groundbreaking on Thursdayfor one of North Carolinas first highway improvement projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The event was held at the George M. Wood Memorial Park on U.S. 158 in Camden County near the Camden/Pasquotank County line.



The $6.1 million project will widen a congested 2.4-mile stretch of U.S. 158 from east of the Pasquotank River to north of Havenwood Drive in Elizabeth City from two to four lanes. The highway is known locally as the Camden Causeway and serves as the main link between Elizabeth City and Camden and Currituck counties.



This recovery project will make a significant contribution to Camden County and this region now and in the future, Perdue said. It will quickly put people to work and have a significant economic impact. Improving U.S. 158 helps northeastern North Carolina prepare for future growth and ensures this region is ready when new opportunities arise.



The U.S. 158 widening project is one of 11 economic recovery projects awarded to contract in March. The projects are located in Alamance, Brunswick, Camden, Currituck, Forsyth/Stokes, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Scotland and Stanly counties. It is also one of the $466 million first phase recovery infrastructure projects that are expected to create and sustain 14,000 jobs across the state.

NCOpenBook.gov goes live

This week Governor Perduelaunched the first wave of <http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov, a government transparency website for searching state contracts and grants. Gov. Perdue signed Executive Order No. 4 on January 12, her first day in office, ordering the creation of NC OpenBook.



In the 21st century online accessibility and transparency should be the standard for public information, Perdue said. Were going to let the sun shine in on state contracts.



<http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov provides a database of approximately 2,500 state contracts and 5,000 grants that are now available in a searchable format. The Office of State Budget and Management is working with state agencies and departments to streamline their contract databases so that North Carolina will have a comprehensive searchable database online this year on NC OpenBook.gov.



In addition to state contracts and grants, <http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov will feature detailed information about state agency performance measures and planning as outlined in Executive Order No. 3.



Governor Bev Perdue leads White House Forum on Health Care Reform

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue hosted one of five regional White House Forums on Health Care Reform.She stressed the benefitsthat lowering health care costs would have on businesses and government while trying to create jobs in the midst of economic crisis. She also highlighted North Carolina solutions like Community Care that could work nationally.

Governor Hosts Education Town Hall Meeting in Wilmington

On Wednesday, Governor Perdue hosted a town hall meeting at Cape Fear Community College in Wilmington.

A packed and lively crowd of 300 citizensasked questions and discussed education and workforce development issues with Governor Perdue, Harrison and Ralls.



GovernorPerdue on theStates Motion to Intervene in Alcoas Yadkin River Hydroelectric Dam Relicensing

Gov. Bev Perduethis weekannounced North Carolinas Attorney General has, at her request, filed a petition with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to be allowed to participate in proceedings regarding the relicensingof a hydroelectric dam project on the Yadkin River. Gov. Perdue is asking the commission to consider rededicating the public resource -- the river and the power generated by the dam  to public use that would serve the citizens and help North Carolinas economy.



The waters of the Yadkin River belong to the people of North Carolina. Fifty years ago, we endorsed Alcoas request for a federal license to operate hydroelectric dams on the river because they powered the companys aluminum smelting works. That facility was a linchpin in the regional economy and created jobs for up to 1000 North Carolina workers. said Gov. Perdue. Today the smelter and the jobs are gone  and so is the reason for the license. Im asking FERC to enable the recapture of the license so it can be used once again to help create jobs and economic opportunity for the region.



Governor Signs Legislation Authorizing Grandfather Mountain State Park

On Tuesday, Gov. Bev Perdue signed legislation formally authorizing Grandfather Mountain as the states newest state park.



An agreement for the state to purchase the undeveloped, backcountry portion of Grandfather Mountain was announced in September. Funding for the $12 million acquisition will come equally from the Parks and Recreation and Natural Heritage trust funds. Grandfather Mountain State Park will be comprised of these 2,456 acres, which the state will purchase from the Morton family later this spring.



The creation of a signature state park at Grandfather Mountain is a big step in adding to the quality of life and beauty of our great state while we also preserve North Carolinas spectacular public lands for future generations, said Gov. Perdue. Thanks to the Morton family and our conservation partners, visitors from inside and outside of North Carolina will be able to enjoy the majesty of this wonderful mountain for generations to come.



House and Senate authorization bills had 48 co-sponsoring legislators. The primary sponsor of Senate Bill 89 was Sen. Joe Sam Queen, of Haywood County. Primary sponsors of House Bill 128 were Reps. Phillip Frye of Mitchell County, Edgar Starnes of Caldwell County, and Cullie Tarleton of Watauga County.



The heirs of company founder Hugh Morton will continue to operate the travel destination with its nature center, wildlife habitats and mile-high swinging bridge on a paid admission basis. The acquisition agreement gives the state a conservation easement on 749 acres of the original property where the attraction is located. The state parks system is coordinating an interim management plan with the Morton family for the backcountry property and its 12 miles of trails.



The acquisition was arranged in 2008 with the help of The Conservation Fund and one of its directors, Mike Leonard, and The Nature Conservancy, which holds conservation easements on the mountain and surrounding properties totaling close to 4,000 acres. The property lies in Watauga, Avery and Caldwell counties, and contains the headwaters of both the Watauga and Linville rivers. Developed as an attraction by Hugh Morton in the 1950s, it boasts 73 rare species and is distinguished by the 5,946-foot Calloway Peak.



On-Site Accountability Visit to Pasquotank Correctional Institute

On Thursday, Gov. Bev Perdue made an unannounced visit to the Pasquotank Correctional Institute in Elizabeth City. During her 45-minute visit, she was shown the close custody section of the prison, the vocational unit, and she spoke at length with prison staff members.



My visit to Pasquotank Correctional Institute gave me the opportunity to see first hand the work our correctional officers and other staff do to protect the publics safety. This is one area, like all the segments of our public safety system, in which nothing less than the highest standards must be maintained, said Perdue.



The visit was a follow up on Gov. Perdues pledge to make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies across North Carolina.



Governor Perdue, State Experts Join Fight Against Chronic Disease

Gov. Bev Perdue announcedon Fridaythat North Carolina will become one of the largest states to join the <http://www.fightchronicdisease.org/>Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease (PFCD).



My goal is for North Carolina to be a national leader in health care, said Perdue during a kick off event at the East Carolina Heart Institute in Greenville. Cracking down on chronic disease will save lives, it will lessen the heavy burden of medical costs that many families face, and it will reduce health care expenses for our state.



As national policy-makers consider new approaches to health care, PFCD amplifies the voices of individual states concerned about the millions of lives and billions of dollars lost to chronic disease. a state level, PFCD brings together dozens of leading health care organizations (39 and counting) to share best practices and new ideas.



Speaking alongside Gov. Perdue, Dr. Paul R.G. Cunningham, dean of the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University and co-chair of the NC PFCD, said, "To truly address the health care of every North Carolinian and American, comprehensive reform must go beyond providing better coverage. It also must address chronic disease, the number one driver of health problems in our nation."



Cancer, heart disease, asthma, obesity and other chronic diseases claim 1.7 million American lives per year and cost more than $1.5 trillion. The toll on North Carolina is also devastating, and threatens to get worse.



Operation Slow Down

Monday, Gov. Bev Perdue announcedthat the N.C. State Highway Patrol and the Governors Highway Safety Programwere kicking off Operation Slow Down/No Need 2 Speed to catch speeders on North Carolinas highways. Local law enforcement agencies will join troopers from now through April 12 to encourage drivers to slow down and follow the speed limit.



North Carolina law enforcement will be going after speeders who recklessly endanger our citizens, said Perdue. Speed is the leading cause of crashes on our highways. I urge motorists to slow down and obey the speed limit. 



Last year 1,405 people were killed in traffic crashes on North Carolina highways; speed was the leading cause of those crashes. Stepped-up enforcement will be conducted across the state, focusing on motorists speeding.



Dangerous driving can be reported to the Highway Patrol by dialing *HP on cellular phones from anywhere in the state. For more information about Operation Slow Down 2009, visit the N.C. Department of Crime Control and Public Safetys Web site at <http://www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp>www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp.

Dear Mrs. Perdue I am a resident of Lumberton NC. I have attended Bladen
Community College for the last year taking my prerequisites to enter the
nursing program in the fall of 2009.I have taken all the classes my
councilors, and teachers told me to take and they actually made my
schedules for me.It is a year later and it is finally time to take the net
test ( nurse entrance
exam )which can only be taken once a year. I paid my dues for the test. My
counsilors and teachers reviewed
my classes and gave me the go ahead to take the test.My GPA is 3.92 ,
almost a perfect 4.0.  It is now one week
before the test, and I am told I cannot take the test because my councilor
made a
mistake and I was suppose to have taken biology 110, which is High School
Biology again. I did take it back in High School twenty years ago and they
knew
it. I have already taken Biology 168/ anatonmy 1 in college and passed the
course with an A actually a 99 for the entire semester, this biology is
much harder then the High School Biology.  They told me they would either
do an independent study with me, to allow me to take a summer mini
semester so I would still take my test and get credit for it. Well her it
is one week away and they said they are not going to allow me to take his
class at this point. ( Just to let you know they are allowing one student
to do the independent study , and there are four other students who were
also misguided by the same person ,for the same reason, and they are
telling us basically to take a hike.) I followed the chain of command . I
talked to the president of student services, He was useless. I then talked
to the Vice President, he said he would investigate it and let me know. He
then called me yesterday and said the teachers would not agree to it. Just
to let you know the teachers said, not only would they do it for us , but
would do it with no compensation to them at all.. The teachers here are
actually the best teachers I ever had. So he actually was telling a lie. I
then scheduled an appointnment with the president of the college today.
Not only did I attend, but another student in the same predicament
attended as well. The president heard us out. The Vice President was also
there. Tonight the Vice President called me at home and said the same
thing. "They said no". I asked him who they were, and all he could say was
" They said no ". Please answer this one question for me. How can a public
community college let one student have an independent study , and say no
to  the other four students in the same predicament?
 I have all the
emails the teachers sent me admitting they made a mistake and could gladly
correct it for me, but the college administration will not. I cannot
believe with the nursing shortage that there is, the adminitration of this
college, who not only can waiver the basic biology, will not correct the
mistake they made. My wife graduated the nursing program of this same
college only five years ago, She did not to do her high school biology
again. What can I do , I cannot even think about having to wait another
year for the opportunity to take this test. When it was not my mistake.

More States Look to Raise Taxes

* 

By <http://online.wsj.com/search/search_center.html?KEYWORDS=LESLIE+EATON&ARTICLESEARCHQUERY_PARSER=bylineAND>LESLIE EATON

A free fall in tax revenue is driving more state lawmakers to turn to broad-based tax increases in a bid to close widening budget gaps.

At least 10 states are considering some kind of major increase in sales or income taxes: Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin. California and New York lawmakers already have agreed on multibillion-dollar tax increases that went into effect earlier this year.

Fiscal experts say more states are likely to try to raise tax revenue in coming months, especially once they tally the latest shortfalls from April 15 income-tax filings, often the biggest single source of funds for the 43 states that levy them.

The squeeze is especially severe in states hit hardest by the recession, such as Arizona, where sales-tax revenue has fallen by 10.5%, income-tax collections are down 15.7% this fiscal year, and the government faces a $3.4 billion budget gap next year. But such shortfalls are likely to be widespread; federal income-tax receipts from individuals have dropped more than 15% in the past six months, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates.

While most states so far have managed to cope with dwindling cash by cutting spending and raising fees on things such as fishing licenses and car registrations, that is unlikely to be enough in the new fiscal years that generally begin July 1, many analysts said.

"Income taxes and sales taxes are the go-to taxes when you really need to raise a lot of money," said Donald J. Boyd, who monitors states' fiscal health for the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany, N.Y.

Sales-tax revenue has fallen more sharply than at any time in the past 50 years, Mr. Boyd said, and he expects income-tax collections to drop below levels state officials projected -- though the extent of the damage probably won't become clear until May.


Raising taxes is a perilous proposition for lawmakers, who must balance their states' budgets every year. Not only do they face political heat for increasing financial burdens during the recession, but added taxes risk worsening their states' economic problems by, for example, further hobbling consumer spending.

Some lawmakers say they have little choice. "With the size of our budget gap, we are looking at a situation of closing down our courts, releasing prisoners and cutting the school year by as much as a month," said Rep. Peter Buckley, co-chairman of Oregon's joint Ways and Means Committee.

His committee is considering an income-tax increase on high-earners, along with major budget cuts, to help close a projected $4.4 billion budget gap over the next two fiscal years. And things could get worse after a revenue forecast due out May 15, he said, because Oregon's unemployment rate has climbed to 10.8% and the state relies on income-tax revenue.

Oregon Gov. Ted Kulongoski is likely to support the surcharge, said a spokeswoman , because the state is faced with losing as much as a third of its tax revenue.

Legislators know the increases will be unpopular with residents. "There will be blame, we accept that," Sen. Eileen M. Daily of Connecticut said earlier this month when she and fellow Democrats announced a budget that raises income-tax rates and expands the sales tax to raise more than $3 billion over the next two years. Connecticut Gov. Jodi Rell, a Republican, has said she would veto the plan.

But some governors are proposing tax increases. Delaware Gov. Jack Markell wants to raise the marginal income-tax rate by one percentage point, to 6.95%, on those earning more than $60,000 a year, effective in 2010. His budget plan also includes increases in corporate taxes as well as spending cuts to close a projected $750 million shortfall in a $3 billion budget, said spokesman Joe Rogalsky.

Many states remain determined to balance their budgets by relying solely on spending cuts. That is the case in Indiana, where raising revenue "is really not on the table," said Pat Bauer, the speaker of the state House.

Instead, he hopes to tap the state's rainy-day fund and to produce a budget that covers only one year, rather than the usual two, because plunging revenue makes it impossible to forecast that far in advance.

Tax collections have dropped drastically the past four months, according to Christopher A. Ruhl, director of the Indiana Budget Agency. Income-tax collections, which reflect withholding and estimated tax payments, fell 21% in March compared with last year and are down 7% for the fiscal year.

States have lowered revenue forecasts repeatedly in recent months, yet the estimates still seem to exceed the grim reality. Last week, Pennsylvania officials said total March tax collections were $334.6 million, or 7.9%, short of expectations, due to sharp drops in income and sales taxes and a steep decline in corporate income taxes. For the fiscal year that began July 1, 2008, collections to date are running $1.6 billion less than forecast.

This has led some experts, such as Nicholas Johnson of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, to predict more legislatures will take up broad-based tax increases as early as May or June. "The problem," he said, "is that they are filling a hole that has gotten a little deeper."

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am very troubled by the Division of Air Quality's decision to
classify the Cliffside coal plant as a "minor" source of air
pollution. You campaigned last year to put North Carolina on the
path to clean energy. You should have used the power of your
office to insist that DAQ uphold the strictest standards as
possible with the Cliffside plant.

On the first major energy decision of your administration, you
have failed the very voters of North Carolina who elected you.

1. What signals are we looking at for recovery?



Jobless claims, ISM, capital goods orders, M2



2. Stimulus today is fine but the exit for both Obama and the Fed sets up lots of risks for decision-makers and investors



3. Interaction, especially at the global level between capital flows, policy and the dollar will produce a broad range of up/down possible outcomes during the next three years that decision-makers must account for in their risk/stress testing

In your research on illegal immigration, what do you have on terrorists cells formed over the years and their members are illegal immigrants?

We have found a direct link with illegal immigration and terrorists. They are using our illegal immigration debate against us.

What are your thoughts on what this radical Muslim says about their people carrying 4 pounds of anthrax into the U.S. and distributing it on the White House lawn? Link to the scenes of illegal aliens crossing the border with backpacks on and you will see what is happening.

Why are we not hearing illegal immigration and terrorism in the same sentence?



from the Lips of an Islamist & "Draggin' The Line"

This is how our government is protecting us!

I have provided you with two video links, one of a terrorists talking about carrying four pounds of anthrax through tunnels from Mexico into the United States and dispersing it. The another video is a link to Border Invasion Pics website showing illegal aliens crossing our borders with backpacks.



One of the illegal aliens in this Border Invasion Pics video is actually from Iran and is called an OTM by Homeland Security. A common concern in border enforcement has been the inability to detain all other-than-Mexican (OTM) aliens along the southwest border, which was often referred to as catch and release. In 2005, approximately 71 percent of OTMs were caught and released along the southwest border. In 2004, it was reported there had been 88,192 OTM with only 20,881 deported, others released. In 2005, 95,292 OTM had been identified with only 32,777 removed. Where are the others?



The OTM in question graduated from one of the worlds three special terrorist school (Iran, Brazil and Venezuela) whereby jihadists learn how to speak English and Spanish, along with learning advanced terrorism techniques. Can you identify him? He is the one carrying a backpack with four pounds of anthrax inside. He is on his way to your city and will spread it with sounds of joy.
Border intruder traffic is as high as ever. They are just going around the short pedestrian fence segments, and coming across in more remote areas - where the BP cannot get at them as easily.



A vehicle barrier is not a fence! Do you think we should have troops permanently assigned to our border 24/7?



Now which illegal alien was an OTM carrying four pounds of anthrax capable of killing 330,000 Americans? Oh yes, he is the one with the backpack. Once at the Border Invasion Pics website, <http://www.borderinvasionpics.com/>http://www.borderinvasionpics.com/ then link to the video on the left side of the screen titled, "Draggin' The Line"



They are only here to do take jobs Americans will not do.



Here is what an Islamist has to say about Americas future. Do you think E-Verify will help catch him when he tries to find a job and settle down in his sleeper cell among other illegal alien groups?



Oh, we do not know if any of these fine folks are OTMs, we just wanted you to think about it for a while before you watch the next chilling video. Keep in mind, our useless government will not protect the borders by building the fences. We must have permanent military camps along the borders to stop drugs, terrorists, human smuggling, guns, and illegal aliens from crossing.

from the Lips of an Islamist


Why is our shared mission so important?

Why is the Islamist threat so dangerous?

Why is it essential that we overcome political correctness in America and awaken citizens everywhere?

Why?

Watch this chilling, newly-released video.

<http://www.tangle.com/view_video.php?viewkey=0861ff3eabea1ceb73e4>http://www.tangle.com/view_video.php?viewkey=0861ff3eabea1ceb73e4


The video starts with a man, who later claims to be Abdullah Fahd Abd Al- Aziz Al-Mafiosi saying he is inciting you by what he says. Four pounds of anthrax in a suitcase this big (he demonstrates the size of a small briefcase) carried by a fighter through tunnels from Mexico into the U.S. are guaranteed to kill 330,000 Americans within a single hour if it is properly spread in population centers there. What a horrifying idea. 9/11 will look like small change in comparison. Am I right? There is no need for airplanes, conspiracies, timings, and so on. One person, with the courage to carry four pounds of anthrax, will go to the White House lawn and will spread this confetti all over them, and then will do cries of joy. It will turn into a real celebration.

Do you think your government is protecting you against terrorism? Think again!

Go to the Christian Action Network website to watch the short trailer Homegrown Terrorism: The Terrorist Camps Around U.S.

We recommend you order the video and share it with friends.

Ask your local, state and national politicians why these terrorist camps are still operating.
