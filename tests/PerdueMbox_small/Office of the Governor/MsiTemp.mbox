Governor Breaks Ground on First Economic Recovery Highway Project

Gov. Bev Perdue was joined by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and local elected officials in Camden County at a groundbreaking on Thursday for one of North Carolina’s first highway improvement projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The event was held at the George M. Wood Memorial Park on U.S. 158 in Camden County near the Camden/Pasquotank County line.



The $6.1 million project will widen a congested 2.4-mile stretch of U.S. 158 from east of the Pasquotank River to north of Havenwood Drive in Elizabeth City from two to four lanes. The highway is known locally as the Camden Causeway and serves as the main link between Elizabeth City and Camden and Currituck counties.



“This recovery project will make a significant contribution to Camden County and this region now and in the future,” Perdue said.  “It will quickly put people to work and have a significant economic impact.  Improving U.S. 158 helps northeastern North Carolina prepare for future growth and ensures this region is ready when new opportunities arise.”



The U.S. 158 widening project is one of 11 economic recovery projects awarded to contract in March. The projects are located in Alamance, Brunswick, Camden, Currituck, Forsyth/Stokes, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Scotland and Stanly counties.  It is also one of the $466 million first phase recovery infrastructure projects that are expected to create and sustain 14,000 jobs across the state.

NCOpenBook.gov goes live

This week Governor Perdue launched the first wave of <http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov, a government transparency website for searching state contracts and grants.  Gov. Perdue signed Executive Order No. 4 on January 12, her first day in office, ordering the creation of NC OpenBook.



“In the 21st century online accessibility and transparency should be the standard for public information,” Perdue said.  “We’re going to let the sun shine in on state contracts.”



<http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov provides a database of approximately 2,500 state contracts and 5,000 grants that are now available in a searchable format.  The Office of State Budget and Management is working with state agencies and departments to streamline their contract databases so that North Carolina will have a comprehensive searchable database online this year on NC OpenBook.gov.



In addition to state contracts and grants, <http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov will feature detailed information about state agency performance measures and planning as outlined in Executive Order No. 3.



Governor Bev Perdue leads White House Forum on Health Care Reform

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue hosted one of five regional White House Forums on Health Care Reform.  She stressed the benefits that lowering health care costs would have on businesses and government while trying to create jobs in the midst of economic crisis.  She also highlighted North Carolina solutions like Community Care that could work nationally.



In case you missed it, Rebecca Adelman of the US Department of Health and Human Services <http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/03/31/Regional-Health-Forum-Greensboro-Streamed-and-Live-blogged-at-1030/>live blogged the event.  You can also see a <http://healthreform.gov/slideshows/whforum_nc.html>photo gallery here.



Governor Hosts Education Town Hall Meeting in Wilmington

On Wednesday, Governor Perdue hosted a town hall meeting at Cape Fear Community College in Wilmington.  Joining Governor Perdue were State Schools CEO Bill Harrison and Community College President Scott Ralls.  A packed and lively crowd of 300 citizens asked questions and discussed education and workforce development issues with Governor Perdue, Harrison and Ralls.



Governor Perdue on the State’s Motion to Intervene in Alcoa’s Yadkin River Hydroelectric Dam Relicensing

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced North Carolina’s Attorney General has, at her request, filed a petition with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to be allowed to participate in proceedings regarding the relicensing of a hydroelectric dam project on the Yadkin River.  Gov. Perdue is asking the commission to consider rededicating the public resource -- the river and the power generated by the dam – to public use that would serve the citizens and help North Carolina’s economy.



“The waters of the Yadkin River belong to the people of North Carolina.  Fifty years ago, we endorsed Alcoa’s request for a federal license to operate hydroelectric dams on the river because they powered the company’s aluminum smelting works.  That facility was a linchpin in the regional economy and created jobs for up to 1000 North Carolina workers.”  said Gov. Perdue. “Today the smelter and the jobs are gone – and so is the reason for the license.  I’m asking FERC to enable the recapture of the license so it can be used once  again to help create jobs and economic opportunity for the region.”



Governor Signs Legislation Authorizing Grandfather Mountain State Park

On Tuesday, Gov. Bev Perdue signed legislation formally authorizing Grandfather Mountain as the state’s newest state park.



An agreement for the state to purchase the undeveloped, backcountry portion of Grandfather Mountain was announced in September. Funding for the $12 million acquisition will come equally from the Parks and Recreation and Natural Heritage trust funds. Grandfather Mountain State Park will be comprised of these 2,456 acres, which the state will purchase from the Morton family later this spring.



“The creation of a signature state park at Grandfather Mountain is a big step in adding to the quality of life and beauty of our great state while we also preserve North Carolina’s spectacular public lands for future generations,” said Gov. Perdue.  “Thanks to the Morton family and our conservation partners, visitors from inside and outside of North Carolina will be able to enjoy the majesty of this wonderful mountain for generations to come.”



House and Senate authorization bills had 48 co-sponsoring legislators. The primary sponsor of Senate Bill 89 was Sen. Joe Sam Queen, of Haywood County. Primary sponsors of House Bill 128 were Reps. Phillip Frye of Mitchell County, Edgar Starnes of Caldwell County, and Cullie Tarleton of Watauga County.



The heirs of company founder Hugh Morton will continue to operate the travel destination with its nature center, wildlife habitats and “mile-high” swinging bridge on a paid admission basis. The acquisition agreement gives the state a conservation easement on 749 acres of the original property where the attraction is located. The state parks system is coordinating an interim management plan with the Morton family for the backcountry property and its 12 miles of trails.



The acquisition was arranged in 2008 with the help of The Conservation Fund and one of its directors, Mike Leonard, and The Nature Conservancy, which holds conservation easements on the mountain and surrounding properties totaling close to 4,000 acres. The property lies in Watauga, Avery and Caldwell counties, and contains the headwaters of both the Watauga and Linville rivers. Developed as an attraction by Hugh Morton in the 1950s, it boasts 73 rare species and is distinguished by the 5,946-foot Calloway Peak.



On-Site Accountability Visit to Pasquotank Correctional Institute

On Thursday, Gov. Bev Perdue made an unannounced visit to the Pasquotank Correctional Institute in Elizabeth City.  During her 45-minute visit, she was shown the close custody section of the prison, the vocational unit, and she spoke at length with prison staff members.  



“My visit to Pasquotank Correctional Institute gave me the opportunity to see first hand the work our correctional officers and other staff do to protect the public’s safety.  This is one area, like all the segments of our public safety system, in which nothing less than the highest standards must be maintained,” said Perdue.  



The visit was a follow up on Gov. Perdue’s pledge to make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies across North Carolina. 



Governor Perdue, State Experts Join Fight Against Chronic Disease

Gov. Bev Perdue announced on Friday that North Carolina will become one of the largest states to join the <http://www.fightchronicdisease.org/>Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease (PFCD).



“My goal is for North Carolina to be a national leader in health care,” said Perdue during a kick off event at the East Carolina Heart Institute in Greenville. “Cracking down on chronic disease will save lives, it will lessen the heavy burden of medical costs that many families face, and it will reduce health care expenses for our state.”



As national policy-makers consider new approaches to health care, PFCD amplifies the voices of individual states concerned about the millions of lives and billions of dollars lost to chronic disease.  a state level, PFCD brings together dozens of leading health care organizations (39 and counting) to share best practices and new ideas. 



Speaking alongside Gov. Perdue, Dr. Paul R.G. Cunningham, dean of the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University and co-chair of the NC PFCD, said, "To truly address the health care of every North Carolinian and American, comprehensive reform must go beyond providing better coverage.  It also must address chronic disease, the number one driver of health problems in our nation."



Cancer, heart disease, asthma, obesity and other chronic diseases claim 1.7 million American lives per year and cost more than $1.5 trillion. The toll on North Carolina is also devastating, and threatens to get worse. 



Operation Slow Down

Monday, Gov. Bev Perdue announced that the N.C. State Highway Patrol and the Governor’s Highway Safety Program were kicking off Operation Slow Down/No Need 2 Speed to catch speeders on North Carolina’s highways. Local law enforcement agencies will join troopers from now through April 12 to encourage drivers to slow down and follow the speed limit.



“North Carolina law enforcement will be going after speeders who recklessly endanger our citizens,” said Perdue. “Speed is the leading cause of crashes on our highways. I urge motorists to slow down and obey the speed limit. ”



Last year 1,405 people were killed in traffic crashes on North Carolina highways; speed was the leading cause of those crashes.  Stepped-up enforcement will be conducted across the state, focusing on motorists speeding.



Dangerous driving can be reported to the Highway Patrol by dialing *HP on cellular phones from anywhere in the state. For more information about Operation Slow Down 2009, visit the N.C. Department of Crime Control and Public Safety’s Web site at <http://www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp>www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp. For more information on No Need 2 Speed, go to the Governor's Highway Safety Program Web site at <http://www.ncdot.org/programs/GHSP/>http://www.ncdot.org/programs/GHSP/.

> Governor Perdue on the State’s Motion to Intervene in Alcoa’s Yadkin River Hydroelectric Dam Relicensing

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced North Carolina’s Attorney General has, at her request, filed a petition with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to be allowed to participate in proceedings regarding the relicensing of a hydroelectric dam project on the Yadkin River.  Gov. Perdue is asking the commission to consider rededicating the public resource -- the river and the power generated by the dam – to public use that would serve the citizens and help North Carolina’s economy.

>  

> “The waters of the Yadkin River belong to the people of North Carolina.  Fifty years ago, we endorsed Alcoa’s request for a federal license to operate hydroelectric dams on the river because they powered the company’s aluminum smelting works.  That facility was a linchpin in the regional economy and created jobs for up to 1000 North Carolina workers.”  said Gov. Perdue. “Today the smelter and the jobs are gone – and so is the reason for the license.  I’m asking FERC to enable the recapture of the license so it can be used once  again to help create jobs and economic opportunity for the region.”

>  

> Governor Signs Legislation Authorizing Grandfather Mountain State Park

On Tuesday, Gov. Bev Perdue signed legislation formally authorizing Grandfather Mountain as the state’s newest state park.

>  

> An agreement for the state to purchase the undeveloped, backcountry portion of Grandfather Mountain was announced in September. Funding for the $12 million acquisition will come equally from the Parks and Recreation and Natural Heritage trust funds. Grandfather Mountain State Park will be comprised of these 2,456 acres, which the state will purchase from the Morton family later this spring.

>  

> “The creation of a signature state park at Grandfather Mountain is a big step in adding to the quality of life and beauty of our great state while we also preserve North Carolina’s spectacular public lands for future generations,” said Gov. Perdue.  “Thanks to the Morton family and our conservation partners, visitors from inside and outside of North Carolina will be able to enjoy the majesty of this wonderful mountain for generations to come.”

>  

> House and Senate authorization bills had 48 co-sponsoring legislators. The primary sponsor of Senate Bill 89 was Sen. Joe Sam Queen, of Haywood County. Primary sponsors of House Bill 128 were Reps. Phillip Frye of Mitchell County, Edgar Starnes of Caldwell County, and Cullie Tarleton of Watauga County.

>  

> The heirs of company founder Hugh Morton will continue to operate the travel destination with its nature center, wildlife habitats and “mile-high” swinging bridge on a paid admission basis. The acquisition agreement gives the state a conservation easement on 749 acres of the original property where the attraction is located. The state parks system is coordinating an interim management plan with the Morton family for the backcountry property and its 12 miles of trails.

>  

> The acquisition was arranged in 2008 with the help of The Conservation Fund and one of its directors, Mike Leonard, and The Nature Conservancy, which holds conservation easements on the mountain and surrounding properties totaling close to 4,000 acres. The property lies in Watauga, Avery and Caldwell counties, and contains the headwaters of both the Watauga and Linville rivers. Developed as an attraction by Hugh Morton in the 1950s, it boasts 73 rare species and is distinguished by the 5,946-foot Calloway Peak.

>  

> On-Site Accountability Visit to Pasquotank Correctional Institute

On Thursday, Gov. Bev Perdue made an unannounced visit to the Pasquotank Correctional Institute in Elizabeth City.  During her 45-minute visit, she was shown the close custody section of the prison, the vocational unit, and she spoke at length with prison staff members.  

>  

> “My visit to Pasquotank Correctional Institute gave me the opportunity to see first hand the work our correctional officers and other staff do to protect the public’s safety.  This is one area, like all the segments of our public safety system, in which nothing less than the highest standards must be maintained,” said Perdue.  

>  

> The visit was a follow up on Gov. Perdue’s pledge to make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies across North Carolina.

> Governor Perdue, State Experts Join Fight Against Chronic Disease

Gov. Bev Perdue announced on Friday that North Carolina will become one of the largest states to join the <http://www.fightchronicdisease.org/>Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease (PFCD).

>  

> “My goal is for North Carolina to be a national leader in health care,” said Perdue during a kick off event at the East Carolina Heart Institute in Greenville. “Cracking down on chronic disease will save lives, it will lessen the heavy burden of medical costs that many families face, and it will reduce health care expenses for our state.”

>  

> As national policy-makers consider new approaches to health care, PFCD amplifies the voices of individual states concerned about the millions of lives and billions of dollars lost to chronic disease.  a state level, PFCD brings together dozens of leading health care organizations (39 and counting) to share best practices and new ideas. 

>  

> Speaking alongside Gov. Perdue, Dr. Paul R.G. Cunningham, dean of the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University and co-chair of the NC PFCD, said, "To truly address the health care of every North Carolinian and American, comprehensive reform must go beyond providing better coverage.  It also must address chronic disease, the number one driver of health problems in our nation."

>  

> Cancer, heart disease, asthma, obesity and other chronic diseases claim 1.7 million American lives per year and cost more than $1.5 trillion. The toll on North Carolina is also devastating, and threatens to get worse. 

>    

> Operation Slow Down

Monday, Gov. Bev Perdue announced that the N.C. State Highway Patrol and the Governor’s Highway Safety Program were kicking off Operation Slow Down/No Need 2 Speed to catch speeders on North Carolina’s highways. Local law enforcement agencies will join troopers from now through April 12 to encourage drivers to slow down and follow the speed limit.

>  

> “North Carolina law enforcement will be going after speeders who recklessly endanger our citizens,” said Perdue. “Speed is the leading cause of crashes on our highways. I urge motorists to slow down and obey the speed limit. ”

>  

> Last year 1,405 people were killed in traffic crashes on North Carolina highways; speed was the leading cause of those crashes.  Stepped-up enforcement will be conducted across the state, focusing on motorists speeding.

“The creation of a signature state park at Grandfather Mountain is a big step in adding to the quality of life and beauty of our great state while we also preserve North Carolina’s spectacular public lands for future generations,” said Gov. Perdue.  “Thanks to the Morton family and our conservation partners, visitors from inside and outside of North Carolina will be able to enjoy the majesty of this wonderful mountain for generations to come.”



House and Senate authorization bills had 48 co-sponsoring legislators. The primary sponsor of Senate Bill 89 was Sen. Joe Sam Queen, of Haywood County. Primary sponsors of House Bill 128 were Reps. Phillip Frye of Mitchell County, Edgar Starnes of Caldwell County, and Cullie Tarleton of Watauga County.



The heirs of company founder Hugh Morton will continue to operate the travel destination with its nature center, wildlife habitats and “mile-high” swinging bridge on a paid admission basis. The acquisition agreement gives the state a conservation easement on 749 acres of the original property where the attraction is located. The state parks system is coordinating an interim management plan with the Morton family for the backcountry property and its 12 miles of trails.



The acquisition was arranged in 2008 with the help of The Conservation Fund and one of its directors, Mike Leonard, and The Nature Conservancy, which holds conservation easements on the mountain and surrounding properties totaling close to 4,000 acres. The property lies in Watauga, Avery and Caldwell counties, and contains the headwaters of both the Watauga and Linville rivers. Developed as an attraction by Hugh Morton in the 1950s, it boasts 73 rare species and is distinguished by the 5,946-foot Calloway Peak.



On-Site Accountability Visit to Pasquotank Correctional Institute

On Thursday, Gov. Bev Perdue made an unannounced visit to the Pasquotank Correctional Institute in Elizabeth City.  During her 45-minute visit, she was shown the close custody section of the prison, the vocational unit, and she spoke at length with prison staff members.  



“My visit to Pasquotank Correctional Institute gave me the opportunity to see first hand the work our correctional officers and other staff do to protect the public’s safety.  This is one area, like all the segments of our public safety system, in which nothing less than the highest standards must be maintained,” said Perdue.  



The visit was a follow up on Gov. Perdue’s pledge to make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies across North Carolina. 



Governor Perdue, State Experts Join Fight Against Chronic Disease

Gov. Bev Perdue announced on Friday that North Carolina will become one of the largest states to join the <http://www.fightchronicdisease.org/>Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease (PFCD).



“My goal is for North Carolina to be a national leader in health care,” said Perdue during a kick off event at the East Carolina Heart Institute in Greenville. “Cracking down on chronic disease will save lives, it will lessen the heavy burden of medical costs that many families face, and it will reduce health care expenses for our state.”



As national policy-makers consider new approaches to health care, PFCD amplifies the voices of individual states concerned about the millions of lives and billions of dollars lost to chronic disease.  a state level, PFCD brings together dozens of leading health care organizations (39 and counting) to share best practices and new ideas. 



Speaking alongside Gov. Perdue, Dr. Paul R.G. Cunningham, dean of the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University and co-chair of the NC PFCD, said, "To truly address the health care of every North Carolinian and American, comprehensive reform must go beyond providing better coverage.  It also must address chronic disease, the number one driver of health problems in our nation."



Cancer, heart disease, asthma, obesity and other chronic diseases claim 1.7 million American lives per year and cost more than $1.5 trillion. The toll on North Carolina is also devastating, and threatens to get worse. 



Operation Slow Down

Monday, Gov. Bev Perdue announced that the N.C. State Highway Patrol and the Governor’s Highway Safety Program were kicking off Operation Slow Down/No Need 2 Speed to catch speeders on North Carolina’s highways. Local law enforcement agencies will join troopers from now through April 12 to encourage drivers to slow down and follow the speed limit.



“North Carolina law enforcement will be going after speeders who recklessly endanger our citizens,” said Perdue. “Speed is the leading cause of crashes on our highways. I urge motorists to slow down and obey the speed limit. ”



Last year 1,405 people were killed in traffic crashes on North Carolina highways; speed was the leading cause of those crashes.  Stepped-up enforcement will be conducted across the state, focusing on motorists speeding.



Dangerous driving can be reported to the Highway Patrol by dialing *HP on cellular phones from anywhere in the state. For more information about Operation Slow Down 2009, visit the N.C.

Governor Breaks Ground on First Economic Recovery Highway Project

Gov. Bev Perdue was joined by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and local elected officials in Camden County at a groundbreaking on Thursday for one of North Carolina’s first highway improvement projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The event was held at the George M. Wood Memorial Park on U.S. 158 in Camden County near the Camden/Pasquotank County line.



The $6.1 million project will widen a congested 2.4-mile stretch of U.S. 158 from east of the Pasquotank River to north of Havenwood Drive in Elizabeth City from two to four lanes. The highway is known locally as the Camden Causeway and serves as the main link between Elizabeth City and Camden and Currituck counties.



“This recovery project will make a significant contribution to Camden County and this region now and in the future,” Perdue said.  “It will quickly put people to work and have a significant economic impact.  Improving U.S. 158 helps northeastern North Carolina prepare for future growth and ensures this region is ready when new opportunities arise.”



The U.S. 158 widening project is one of 11 economic recovery projects awarded to contract in March. The projects are located in Alamance, Brunswick, Camden, Currituck, Forsyth/Stokes, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Scotland and Stanly counties.  It is also one of the $466 million first phase recovery infrastructure projects that are expected to create and sustain 14,000 jobs across the state.

NCOpenBook.gov goes live

This week Governor Perdue launched the first wave of <http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov, a government transparency website for searching state contracts and grants.  Gov. Perdue signed Executive Order No. 4 on January 12, her first day in office, ordering the creation of NC OpenBook.



“In the 21st century online accessibility and transparency should be the standard for public information,” Perdue said.  “We’re going to let the sun shine in on state contracts.”



<http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov provides a database of approximately 2,500 state contracts and 5,000 grants that are now available in a searchable format.  The Office of State Budget and Management is working with state agencies and departments to streamline their contract databases so that North Carolina will have a comprehensive searchable database online this year on NC OpenBook.gov.



In addition to state contracts and grants, <http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov will feature detailed information about state agency performance measures and planning as outlined in Executive Order No. 3.



Governor Bev Perdue leads White House Forum on Health Care Reform

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue hosted one of five regional White House Forums on Health Care Reform.  She stressed the benefits that lowering health care costs would have on businesses and government while trying to create jobs in the midst of economic crisis.  She also highlighted North Carolina solutions like Community Care that could work nationally.



In case you missed it, Rebecca Adelman of the US Department of Health and Human Services <http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/03/31/Regional-Health-Forum-Greensboro-Streamed-and-Live-blogged-at-1030/>live blogged the event.  You can also see a <http://healthreform.gov/slideshows/whforum_nc.html>photo gallery here.



Governor Hosts Education Town Hall Meeting in Wilmington

On Wednesday, Governor Perdue hosted a town hall meeting at Cape Fear Community College in Wilmington.  Joining Governor Perdue were State Schools CEO Bill Harrison and Community College President Scott Ralls.  A packed and lively crowd of 300 citizens asked questions and discussed education and workforce development issues with Governor Perdue, Harrison and Ralls.



Governor Perdue on the State’s Motion to Intervene in Alcoa’s Yadkin River Hydroelectric Dam Relicensing

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced North Carolina’s Attorney General has, at her request, filed a petition with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to be allowed to participate in proceedings regarding the relicensing of a hydroelectric dam project on the Yadkin River.  Gov. Perdue is asking the commission to consider rededicating the public resource -- the river and the power generated by the dam – to public use that would serve the citizens and help North Carolina’s economy.



“The waters of the Yadkin River belong to the people of North Carolina.  Fifty years ago, we endorsed Alcoa’s request for a federal license to operate hydroelectric dams on the river because they powered the company’s aluminum smelting works.  That facility was a linchpin in the regional economy and created jobs for up to 1000 North Carolina workers.”  said Gov. Perdue. “Today the smelter and the jobs are gone – and so is the reason for the license.  I’m asking FERC to enable the recapture of the license so it can be used once  again to help create jobs and economic opportunity for the region..”



Governor Signs Legislation Authorizing Grandfather Mountain State Park

On Tuesday, Gov. Bev Perdue signed legislation formally authorizing Grandfather Mountain as the state’s newest state park.



An agreement for the state to purchase the undeveloped, backcountry portion of Grandfather Mountain was announced in September. Funding for the $12 million acquisition will come equally from the Parks and Recreation and Natural Heritage trust funds. Grandfather Mountain State Park will be comprised of these 2,456 acres, which the state will purchase from the Morton family later this spring.

How can I voice concerns about education and the direction the Charlotte Meck system is going. We are loosing our support staff in elementary schools at an alarming rate. Dr. Gorman has  removed school psychologists and parent advocates  from the elementary schools, both important support staff positions, especially in our high poverty schools.
Thank you for making education a priority. My 4 children are out of school, now, but my grandchildren will heading for school in the not to far future. We have worked for many years through PTA, and numerous committees for the school board to improve our schools. The community as a whole benefits from a strong school system.

As a resident of High Rock Lake in Davidson County, I support Senate Bill 967.  
In 2002, I watched in horror as Alcoa drained the lake, killing fish and other wildlife and crippling businesses.  It wasn't until pressure was applied that Alcoa requested a variance to the license to stop the draining.  But, by that point, the damage was done. 
As a citizen, I am supportive of the project being in the hands of the citizens of NC.  It would be irresponsible to allow a profit-making company to have license to the water for another 50 years!  Water will most likely become even more limited over the next 50 years.

Dear Governor Perdue,
Attached is a copy of the email we sent to the Water Resources Committee Members who voted "no" on Senate Bill 967 to establish the Yadkin River Trust.  We want you to understand that all people in Stanly County are not in favor of this bill.  Please consider the long-reaching effects of this important decision.
Our interest in preservation is only surpassed by our love of our beautiful lakes and undeveloped shorelines.

Sincerely,

Badin Historic Museum Board Members

Subject: Leave That Dam Alone!

Comment: Governor Perdue, As a concerned citizen, I ask that you cease your efforts to have the State of North Carolina take over Alcoa's dams on the Yadkin River. This move would be an affront to private property rights, an affront to our free market economy and a horrible move for a state government that is already struggling to make ends meet. Please leave that dam alone!

Comment: Maam, you must stop right now trying to take over property that you have no rights to. When the people find out that you are one of those that believes the government has rights to anything it wants, you will surely be fired. Alcoa's dams are Alcoa's and theirs alone. NOT YOURS. You people are like spoiled little children who think they can just take whatever they want. Read your American history, i implore you. These acts are disgusting are nothing more that government sanctioned theft to nationalize all resources in the country. Have a good day. MM

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I wanted to express my displeasure in the bill proposed to effectively "take-over" the Yadkin river dams. Alcoa has owned this property since the early 1900s, and purchased free and clear. If this bill passes, it will set a tone for further "takings" in the future. I did vote for you in the last election, but feel your stance on this and healthcare will further put our lagging economy in peril.

Hi Jennifer, 

Is this response dated in any way...or is it okay to send as an email response?

Also...Sylvia tells me that the Titan Cement response is being updated by the Policy office.  Is that you?

And...Sylvia also says that the Cliffside response has not be updated during this administration.  Could I get some language on that one too?

Thanks for your help,
Sondra

Are you aware of the  Thomasville Sewage Spill into High Rock Lake.? Why is there no public warning ?
Can you tell us  what is being done to protect  the residents  that live on this lake?
Is the water being tested and what are the results.
I am outraged as my grand children were in that lake.
I recall the day I We came into Buddle  Boat ramp and the stench was  awful , people were saying "Oh it is a dead fish and I said  that must be one huge dead fish.........."
Please protect us

> - Our public safety system is not funded at an adequate level.
> - And this budget does not include additional help for working families, such as an increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit.

> But there are also some areas where we’ve made improvements to the budget.

> - Children in grades K-3 won’t see their class sizes increased, and K-3 teachers and teachers’ assistants are protected.
> - There are protections for at-risk students, especially those in low-performing schools.
> - 87% of all North Carolina families are protected from an income tax surcharge.
> - The budget adds contract acute care beds for mental health services in communities across North Carolina.
> - There are investments for JobsNOW job training, more kids have access to health insurance, and there’s some help for small businesses.

> It’s now several weeks beyond the budget deadline, and teachers go back to school in two weeks. And so, after this long difficult budget process, North Carolina must move forward.  I signed this budget with reservation.

> This year’s budget battle is over, but the fight to protect and improve our schools does not end with a budget document.  I will continue to do everything in my power to work with education leaders, the business community, and most importantly moms and dads to protect and strengthen our schools and give our children a brighter future.

Superintendent Peter Gorman said, “If we didn't have a billion dollar, approximately, revenue package, no one would be coming back and we'd be doing more layoffs.”

Subject: Support for Citizens

Comment: I wanted to use this venue to thank the Governor for taking actions in opposing the Alcoa reliscense for the Badin, NC facility. As a resident nearby our community is left with the ruins of land, a shut down vacated industrial site, and the effects of years of poor environmental stewardship. What one once a prolific thriving community is now in decline because of Alcoa's abandonment leaving the citizen tax payer of NC in their wake. Thank you Gov Bev Perdue for opposing Alcoa on the liscensing issue. A reliscense would result in another fifty years of the same. There a number of other utilities in the state which are good corporate partners with their communities. NC would do well to liscense one of those utilities or support the Yadkin River Trust initative. Thanks again for standing up and being a voice for the citizens of NC against a powerful adversary.

Governor Signs State Budget

Excerpts from Governor Perdue’s Prepared Remarks Regarding the State Budget:

With North Carolina facing the toughest economic crisis since the Depression, there are no easy solutions to the budget crisis.  I’ve made my priorities clear to the people and the General Assembly: 1) raise the revenue necessary to shield North Carolina's public school system and core services from massive cuts and 2) avoid raising across-the-board income taxes on working families in North Carolina.

The budget passed this week is far from perfect.  In fact, it falls short in several areas that are critical to the future of our state:

-  Although it no longer mandates class size increases, it regrettably still includes cuts to Local Education Agencies. 
- Local agencies that provide mental health services face cuts, jeopardizing crucial services mental health services for patients across North Carolina.
- Our public safety system is not funded at an adequate level.
- And this budget does not include additional help for working families, such as an increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit.

But there are also some areas where we’ve made improvements to the budget.

- Children in grades K-3 won’t see their class sizes increased, and K-3 teachers and teachers’ assistants are protected.
- There are protections for at-risk students, especially those in low-performing schools.
- 87% of all North Carolina families are protected from an income tax surcharge.
- The budget adds contract acute care beds for mental health services in communities across North Carolina.
- There are investments for JobsNOW job training, more kids have access to health insurance, and there’s some help for small businesses.

It’s now several weeks beyond the budget deadline, and teachers go back to school in two weeks. And so, after this long difficult budget process, North Carolina must move forward.  I signed this budget with reservation.

This year’s budget battle is over, but the fight to protect and improve our schools does not end with a budget document.  I will continue to do everything in my power to work with education leaders, the business community, and most importantly moms and dads to protect and strengthen our schools and give our children a brighter future.


           Bev Perdue

More on Education Funding

As a result of the additional revenue and education funds that were included in the final version of the budget, many school districts have announced that they will be able to avoid widespread teacher layoffs.  Additionally, the Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools announced they will be rehiring a substantial number of teachers who were laid off at the end of the last school year. Superintendent Peter Gorman said, “If we didn't have a billion dollar, approximately, revenue package, no one would be coming back and we'd be doing more layoffs.” 

Gov. Perdue Announces Investments in Green Economy and Strengthens Energy Policy Leadership

Gov. Bev Perdue today signed House Bill 1481 to strengthen state energy policy leadership and announced 14 Green Business Fund grants, significant steps forward in her JobsNOW Green Economy Plan.

The actions are part of a three-pronged strategy to make North Carolina a leader in green economy jobs by strengthening state leadership in energy policy, making smart investments to create jobs and foster innovation, and providing green-collar workforce training.

“Strong leadership and smart investments are essential to laying a foundation for North Carolina to create green jobs, support green innovation and promote a sustainable future for our state’s economy and environment,” Gov. Perdue said. “Turning green into gold is a central part of my JobsNOW initiative and of my vision to grow North Carolina’s long-term economy.”

Strong Leadership:

As part of the governor’s plan to strengthen and focus leadership in state energy policymaking, HB 1481:

• moves the State Energy Office from the Department of Administration to the Department of Commerce, more closely linking the office’s activities with economic development,
• transfers the Residential Energy Conservation Assistance Program from the Department of Health and Human Services to the relocated State Energy Office,
• strengthens the effectiveness of the Energy Policy Council by improving representation from environmental groups, alternative energy producers and energy services specialists. The council will be refocused on creating green jobs and protecting the environment.

Gov. Perdue is appointing Tim Toben chairman of the Energy Policy Council.

Toben serves on the N.C. Legislative Commission on Global Climate Change and is chairman of the Board of Visitors at the UNC-Chapel Hill Institute for the Environment. He also is a principal in green energy and green building ventures in North Carolina, and he and his wife Megan own and manage an educational farm in Orange County that operates on a hybrid solar and wind renewable energy system.

Green Business Fund Investments:

Gov. Perdue announced 14 awardees from across the state, who will receive up to $99,000 each from the N.C. Green Business Fund to support green innovation, job creation and economic development.

This is the second annual round of grants from the fund, which helps small businesses, nonprofits and other agencies develop and commercialize environmentally friendly and energy-related products and services. See the attachment for a list of grantees.

As lieutenant governor, Perdue proposed the legislation creating the Green Business Fund, which the General Assembly approved in 2007. The funding available each year so far has been $1 million.

Additionally, as part of the governor’s plan, the recently passed state budget includes $5 million in federal recovery money for the Green Business Fund.

Other elements of the governor’s JobsNOW Green Economy Plan include:

• Jump-starting North Carolina’s green economy using more than $265 million in federal recovery funds for renewable energy, energy efficiency and weatherization.

Gov. Perdue Announces Launch of Rural Hope

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday joined the North Carolina Rural Economic Development Center, the Golden LEAF Foundation and the N.C. Health and Wellness Trust Fund (HWTF) in announcing the first phase of grant awards for Rural Hope, a rural health care initiative designed to enable better health care delivery and job creation by assisting in the construction and expansion of rural health care facilities.

“In many areas of our state, rural hospitals and health care facilities work on tight budgets to serve their communities. Rural Hope will ease the burden by bringing health care and jobs to rural communities across North Carolina,” said Perdue. “I commend the North Carolina Rural Center, the Golden Leaf Foundation and the Health and Wellness Trust Fund for working together to support this initiative and making sure our citizens receive the help they need.”

The Rural Hope grant awards are funded by the Rural Center ($3,032,500), the Golden LEAF Foundation ($560,000) and the NC Health and Wellness Trust Fund ($226,366), and range from $32,500 to $480,000, totaling $3,818,866 for the 24 grants awarded.  The grant application required that at least one new job be located in the project building for every $12,000 in grant funds received, resulting in the creation of 310 new jobs.  Application requirements also specified that grants be matched by at least an equal amount of private and/or public funds.

Priority for Rural Hope was given to small towns with a population of less than 5,000 and unincorporated areas, and eligible health care facilities included: hospitals, urgent care centers, physician offices, hospice care, aging centers, mental health providers, physical therapy providers, free clinics, rural and community health centers, dental care, vision care and safety net providers.

North Carolina Breaks into Top 10 Nanotech States

A new study shows that North Carolina has broken into the top 10 states in the nation with the highest concentration of nanotechnology companies, <http://www.nanotechproject.org/news/archive/putting_nanotechnology_on_map/>universities, research laboratories and organizations, and that Raleigh has moved into the top 5 cities designated as “Nano Metro” clusters.

The data was released by the Project on Emerging Technologies, which is a partnership between the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Pew Charitable Trusts. This is the first time North Carolina has been a top-ranked nanotechnology region.

“Nanotechnology is fundamental to North Carolina’s economic development strategy of growing jobs and building a new economy,” Perdue said. “As one of the top 10 nanotech states, North Carolina will continue to push ahead and lead a technology sector that will change every industry and create products that will change the way we live.”

The data was released by the Project on Emerging Technologies and features more than 1,200 organizations across the United States that are part of the nanotechnology industry.  North Carolina joins California, Massachusetts, New York and Texas as one of the top 10 states.

Raleigh pushed out Oakland to become one of the top 5 Nano Metros.  The full study can be found here: <http://www.nanotechproject.org/news/archive/putting_nanotechnology_on_map>www.nanotechproject.org/news/archive/putting_nanotechnology_on_map.

EMC Corp. to Make Major Expansion in Wake, Durham with 397 New Jobs

EMC Corp., a world leader in information infrastructure solutions, will expand in the Triangle, adding 397 jobs over the next five years and investing $280 million. The Fortune 200 company plans to establish a new research facility in Durham County and increase its presence in Research Triangle Park and Apex. The project is contingent upon approval of local grants from Durham city and county officials.

“Information technology companies provide sustainable, well-paying jobs for more than 100,000 workers in North Carolina,” Perdue said. “When a world leader in the industry such as EMC Corp. chooses to expand here, it reinforces our message that this is the place for IT companies to do business.”

As a leading developer and provider of information infrastructure technology, solutions and services, EMC provides a foundation for organizations of all sizes to manage and secure their vast and ever-increasing quantities of information; automate their data center operations; reduce power and cooling costs; and leverage critical information for business agility and competitive advantage.  

Headquartered in Massachusetts, EMC Corp. (NYSE: EMC) employs more than 40,000 people worldwide, including more than 900 employees in North Carolina. The 397 new jobs will pay an overall average salary of $73,325 per year, not including benefits. That is higher than the Durham annual average of $57,772 and the Wake average of $43,160.

North Carolina continues to have a top ranked business climate. Through Gov. Perdue’s JobsNOW initiative (<http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov>www.jobsnow.nc.gov), the state continues to work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain its workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

Townsends Adds 103 Jobs in Davie County

Townsends Inc., a leading international producer and marketer of poultry products, will expand in Davie County.  The company plans to create 103 jobs and invest $700,000 over the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

“Food production and economic growth go hand in hand in North Carolina, a tradition underscored by Townsends’ expansion in Mocksville,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Companies like this one continue to find success and expand in our state, attracted by our high-quality workforce and business-friendly environment.”

Townsends, a 118-year-old poultry company headquartered in Delaware, supplies value-added chicken products to the domestic and international food service and retail markets.  The company has a significant presence in North Carolina with three plants located in Pittsboro, Siler City and Mocksville that employ about 1,500 people.  Additionally, the company’s poultry operations support an extensive grower base in the local area.

The Mocksville facility, operating as Crestwood Farms, a division of Townsends, is the core of the company’s expansion into value-added chicken products and key to its strategic growth.  The company plans to add a production line of fully cooked products, increasing its capacity by approximately 25 percent.  Currently, Crestwood Farms employs about 267 workers.

State Seeks Return of Yadkin River Flows, Hydroelectric License to the People of North Carolina

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that the State of North Carolina has filed papers with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) seeking return of the right to plan the use of the Yadkin River flows and the Yadkin hydroelectric project for the benefit of the people of North Carolina.

“Fifty years ago, we endorsed Alcoa’s request for a federal license to operate hydroelectric dams because the project created jobs for up to 1,000 North Carolinians,” said Perdue.  “Today, those jobs are gone, and so is the reason for the license.”

“The State of North Carolina is responsible for the health and well-being of its citizens,” Perdue said. “Given the Yadkin River’s broad impact on the state, we believe strongly that the state is the most appropriate body to plan use of this invaluable natural resource, to help assure the region’s municipal water supply and quality and to facilitate future growth and development.”

The Yadkin River Basin includes nearly a quarter of the state’s 100 counties, representing 17.5 percent of its population.

The initial federal license for the Yadkin hydroelectric facilities, which expired in 2008, was granted more than 50 years ago to Alcoa Power Generating Inc. APGI developed a series of dam and hydroelectric plants to serve the industrial needs of its parent company, Alcoa Inc., namely, its aluminum smelting plant in nearby Badin, which required a significant amount of power. The facilities comprising the Yadkin Project have essentially determined how the Yadkin River flows have been used in the state for the past 100 years.

Metal Manufacturer Brings New Plant, 45 Jobs to Surry County

Central States Manufacturing Inc., a regional manufacturer of metal building components, will open a new plant in Mount Airy.  The company plans to invest more than $4.5 million and create 45 jobs.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $135,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

“North Carolina retains a strong presence in the manufacturing sector,” Perdue said.  “Our state’s skilled workforce, strategic location and outstanding quality of life continue to attract growing companies such as Central States Manufacturing.”

Central States Manufacturing Inc., headquartered in Arkansas, manufactures and delivers high-quality metal building components to post frame, commercial and residential customers.  The employee-owned company currently has manufacturing facilities in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana and Texas.

Operations at the new metalworking plant will include forming, cutting and assembling coated steel parts and panels.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $40,656, not including benefits, which is significantly higher than Surry County’s average annual wage of $28,236.

Gov. Perdue Establishes Offshore Energy Advisory Panel

Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday announced the establishment of the Governor’s Scientific Advisory Panel on Offshore Energy.  The panel will thoroughly examine the state’s offshore energy resources, including oil, gas, wind and other renewable resources, and will make recommendations to ensure that North Carolina’s offshore resources are used for the benefit of all its citizens.  The Governor created the panel by signing <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=636>Executive Order 23.

“The North Carolina coast is home to an abundance of natural resources – some of which have the potential to be tapped as energy sources.  As we research this potential for national and state use, I intend to make sure sound science and a thorough examination of the risks and benefits drive our decisions,” said Perdue. “It is imperative that North Carolina have the opportunity to share in the profits and not limit our options to pursue alternative energy solutions such as wind power.”

The panel will analyze and report on the feasibility of tapping offshore energy sources, and identify the benefits and areas of concern about these energy resources. Members will study current laws, rules, processes and procedures that affect the use of offshore energy resources, such as federal leasing programs, state and federal permitting programs, and local zoning and ordinances. Also, the panel will evaluate federal proposals to use North Carolina’s offshore energy resources, including any proposals from the U.S. Minerals Management Service for offshore oil and gas lease sales.

Additionally today, the Governor submitted a letter to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, outlining her concerns with the Draft Proposed 5-Year Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2010–2015.  They are:

• The lack of information surrounding which coastal areas are under consideration for energy exploration.
• The federal government has not resolved the issue of revenue sharing for North Carolina and other East Coast states.
• The planning process does not take into consideration potential future uses of renewable sources of energy in the same areas.  The governor is committed to exploring all offshore energy sources including wind and other renewable resources.

Gov. Perdue Announces Launch of Rural Hope

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday joined the North Carolina Rural Economic Development Center, the Golden LEAF Foundation and the N.C. Health and Wellness Trust Fund (HWTF) in announcing the first phase of grant awards for Rural Hope, a rural health care initiative designed to enable better health care delivery and job creation by assisting in the construction and expansion of rural health care facilities.

“In many areas of our state, rural hospitals and health care facilities work on tight budgets to serve their communities. Rural Hope will ease the burden by bringing health care and jobs to rural communities across North Carolina,” said Perdue. “I commend the North Carolina Rural Center, the Golden Leaf Foundation and the Health and Wellness Trust Fund for working together to support this initiative and making sure our citizens receive the help they need.”

The Rural Hope grant awards are funded by the Rural Center ($3,032,500), the Golden LEAF Foundation ($560,000) and the NC Health and Wellness Trust Fund ($226,366), and range from $32,500 to $480,000, totaling $3,818,866 for the 24 grants awarded.  The grant application required that at least one new job be located in the project building for every $12,000 in grant funds received, resulting in the creation of 310 new jobs.  Application requirements also specified that grants be matched by at least an equal amount of private and/or public funds.

Priority for Rural Hope was given to small towns with a population of less than 5,000 and unincorporated areas, and eligible health care facilities included: hospitals, urgent care centers, physician offices, hospice care, aging centers, mental health providers, physical therapy providers, free clinics, rural and community health centers, dental care, vision care and safety net providers.

North Carolina Breaks into Top 10 Nanotech States

A new study shows that North Carolina has broken into the top 10 states in the nation with the highest concentration of nanotechnology companies, <http://www.nanotechproject.org/news/archive/putting_nanotechnology_on_map/>universities, research laboratories and organizations, and that Raleigh has moved into the top 5 cities designated as “Nano Metro” clusters.

The data was released by the Project on Emerging Technologies, which is a partnership between the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Pew Charitable Trusts. This is the first time North Carolina has been a top-ranked nanotechnology region.

“Nanotechnology is fundamental to North Carolina’s economic development strategy of growing jobs and building a new economy,” Perdue said. “As one of the top 10 nanotech states, North Carolina will continue to push ahead and lead a technology sector that will change every industry and create products that will change the way we live.”

The data was released by the Project on Emerging Technologies and features more than 1,200 organizations across the United States that are part of the nanotechnology industry.  North Carolina joins California, Massachusetts, New York and Texas as one of the top 10 states.

Raleigh pushed out Oakland to become one of the top 5 Nano Metros.  The full study can be found here: <http://www.nanotechproject.org/news/archive/putting_nanotechnology_on_map>www.nanotechproject.org/news/archive/putting_nanotechnology_on_map.

EMC Corp. to Make Major Expansion in Wake, Durham with 397 New Jobs

EMC Corp., a world leader in information infrastructure solutions, will expand in the Triangle, adding 397 jobs over the next five years and investing $280 million. The Fortune 200 company plans to establish a new research facility in Durham County and increase its presence in Research Triangle Park and Apex. The project is contingent upon approval of local grants from Durham city and county officials.

“Information technology companies provide sustainable, well-paying jobs for more than 100,000 workers in North Carolina,” Perdue said. “When a world leader in the industry such as EMC Corp. chooses to expand here, it reinforces our message that this is the place for IT companies to do business.”

As a leading developer and provider of information infrastructure technology, solutions and services, EMC provides a foundation for organizations of all sizes to manage and secure their vast and ever-increasing quantities of information; automate their data center operations; reduce power and cooling costs; and leverage critical information for business agility and competitive advantage.  

Headquartered in Massachusetts, EMC Corp. (NYSE: EMC) employs more than 40,000 people worldwide, including more than 900 employees in North Carolina. The 397 new jobs will pay an overall average salary of $73,325 per year, not including benefits. That is higher than the Durham annual average of $57,772 and the Wake average of $43,160.

North Carolina continues to have a top ranked business climate. Through Gov. Perdue’s JobsNOW initiative (<http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov>www.jobsnow.nc.gov), the state continues to work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain its workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

Townsends Adds 103 Jobs in Davie County

Townsends Inc., a leading international producer and marketer of poultry products, will expand in Davie County.  The company plans to create 103 jobs and invest $700,000 over the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

“Food production and economic growth go hand in hand in North Carolina, a tradition underscored by Townsends’ expansion in Mocksville,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Companies like this one continue to find success and expand in our state, attracted by our high-quality workforce and business-friendly environment.”

Townsends, a 118-year-old poultry company headquartered in Delaware, supplies value-added chicken products to the domestic and international food service and retail markets.  The company has a significant presence in North Carolina with three plants located in Pittsboro, Siler City and Mocksville that employ about 1,500 people.  Additionally, the company’s poultry operations support an extensive grower base in the local area.

The Mocksville facility, operating as Crestwood Farms, a division of Townsends, is the core of the company’s expansion into value-added chicken products and key to its strategic growth.  The company plans to add a production line of fully cooked products, increasing its capacity by approximately 25 percent.  Currently, Crestwood Farms employs about 267 workers.

State Seeks Return of Yadkin River Flows, Hydroelectric License to the People of North Carolina

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that the State of North Carolina has filed papers with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) seeking return of the right to plan the use of the Yadkin River flows and the Yadkin hydroelectric project for the benefit of the people of North Carolina.

“Fifty years ago, we endorsed Alcoa’s request for a federal license to operate hydroelectric dams because the project created jobs for up to 1,000 North Carolinians,” said Perdue.  “Today, those jobs are gone, and so is the reason for the license.”

“The State of North Carolina is responsible for the health and well-being of its citizens,” Perdue said. “Given the Yadkin River’s broad impact on the state, we believe strongly that the state is the most appropriate body to plan use of this invaluable natural resource, to help assure the region’s municipal water supply and quality and to facilitate future growth and development.”

The Yadkin River Basin includes nearly a quarter of the state’s 100 counties, representing 17.5 percent of its population.

The initial federal license for the Yadkin hydroelectric facilities, which expired in 2008, was granted more than 50 years ago to Alcoa Power Generating Inc. APGI developed a series of dam and hydroelectric plants to serve the industrial needs of its parent company, Alcoa Inc., namely, its aluminum smelting plant in nearby Badin, which required a significant amount of power. The facilities comprising the Yadkin Project have essentially determined how the Yadkin River flows have been used in the state for the past 100 years.

Metal Manufacturer Brings New Plant, 45 Jobs to Surry County

Central States Manufacturing Inc., a regional manufacturer of metal building components, will open a new plant in Mount Airy.  The company plans to invest more than $4.5 million and create 45 jobs.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $135,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

“North Carolina retains a strong presence in the manufacturing sector,” Perdue said.  “Our state’s skilled workforce, strategic location and outstanding quality of life continue to attract growing companies such as Central States Manufacturing.”

Central States Manufacturing Inc., headquartered in Arkansas, manufactures and delivers high-quality metal building components to post frame, commercial and residential customers.  The employee-owned company currently has manufacturing facilities in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana and Texas.

Operations at the new metalworking plant will include forming, cutting and assembling coated steel parts and panels.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $40,656, not including benefits, which is significantly higher than Surry County’s average annual wage of $28,236.

Gov. Perdue Establishes Offshore Energy Advisory Panel

Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday announced the establishment of the Governor’s Scientific Advisory Panel on Offshore Energy.  The panel will thoroughly examine the state’s offshore energy resources, including oil, gas, wind and other renewable resources, and will make recommendations to ensure that North Carolina’s offshore resources are used for the benefit of all its citizens.  The Governor created the panel by signing <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=636> Executive Order 23.

“The North Carolina coast is home to an abundance of natural resources – some of which have the potential to be tapped as energy sources.  As we research this potential for national and state use, I intend to make sure sound science and a thorough examination of the risks and benefits drive our decisions,” said Perdue. “It is imperative that North Carolina have the opportunity to share in the profits and not limit our options to pursue alternative energy solutions such as wind power.”

The panel will analyze and report on the feasibility of tapping offshore energy sources, and identify the benefits and areas of concern about these energy resources. Members will study current laws, rules, processes and procedures that affect the use of offshore energy resources, such as federal leasing programs, state and federal permitting programs, and local zoning and ordinances. Also, the panel will evaluate federal proposals to use North Carolina’s offshore energy resources, including any proposals from the U.S. Minerals Management Service for offshore oil and gas lease sales.

Additionally today, the Governor submitted a letter to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, outlining her concerns with the Draft Proposed 5-Year Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2010–2015.  They are:

• The lack of information surrounding which coastal areas are under consideration for energy exploration.
• The federal government has not resolved the issue of revenue sharing for North Carolina and other East Coast states.
• The planning process does not take into consideration potential future uses of renewable sources of energy in the same areas.  The governor is committed to exploring all offshore energy sources including wind and other renewable resources.
