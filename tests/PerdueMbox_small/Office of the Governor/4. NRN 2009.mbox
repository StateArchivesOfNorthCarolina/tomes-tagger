State of North Carolina

UPDATE: We know many of you have been following the important issue of the potential release of dozens of inmates sentenced to life in prison.  There were important developments on Friday and we want to keep you up-to-date on the latest news.



Judge Gentry Caudill of Cleveland County on Friday ruled in favor of the state and denied release for Wilbur Folston, one of several inmates sentenced to life in prison in the 1970s whose sentences are in question due to recent court rulings.  Judge Caudill’s ruling directly contradicts Judge Ripley Rand’s decision earlier this week in the cases of inmates Faye Brown and Alford Jones.



In his decision, Judge Caudill ruled that "no Secretary of Correction has ever directed good-behavior credits to be applied to calculate an unconditional release date for a life sentence."



Additionally, the state Supreme Court on Friday afternoon blocked the scheduled release of Brown and Jones and will review the case.  According to news reports the Supreme Court is likely to decide within the next 10 days on a potential hearing.



Governor Perdue believes Judge Caudill’s decision is the correct one as this important issue now moves to the Supreme Court.



The Supreme Court’s decision is the most appropriate step as the state seeks a conclusive answer on how to make sure inmates are not released without a proper and thorough review by the Parole Commission. The bottom line remains: inmates sentenced to life should not be allowed to walk out the prison door without a parole review and appropriate post-release supervision.

Subject: ALE STING

Comment: I suppose it has become a standard practice with companies to setup their employees to fail. Back when... if someone you've helped succeeded so then have you. Unfortunately Wilco Hess and the State of NC are set on weeding out employees, good emloyees. I am talking about ALE stings. Alcohol Law Enforcement. You see, ALE sent a 17 year old into Wilco for no other reason but to catch the cashier (me) selling a cigarello without asking for ID. and the agent comes in and yells gotcha. your fired. but what is better than that Wilco agrees with the state of NC. i have now become a worthless human being. the state of NC then agrees with Wilco and I am not entitled to unemployment benefits, and wilco says the benefits I so diligently watched grow no longer exist. "YOU'VE BEEN FIRED". So I then do the right thing and go to court. this is when I really found out just how worthless I rally am to both wilco and the state of NC. In my case the state of NC's ale agent got me fired from wilco. a $7 an hour job just so I can pay court costs of $120, pay probation fees of $200 and do community service for 24 hrs in 30 days. all with no job and no unemployment and no vacation time (dollars)from wilco. so there you have it. I am unemployed by the grace of the great state of NC and because I worked for Wilco and didn't take time to ask for ID, because I was afraid someone would walk out of the store before I had a chance to wait on them for wilco and the state of NC. remember when wilco takes in a $1 so does the state of NC. the better news is I am 60 years old and no longer working at wilco. the state of NC and Wilco were successful in that they set me up to fail and I fell victim to the set up. GOOD JOB to the state of NC ALE agents and WILCO

My husband and I are voting residents of Asheville and we attended a meeting last week at the Skyland Fire Department. This meeting concerned the CTS TOXIC WASTE SITE on Mills Gap Road. We live approximately 1 mile from this site and we are concerned about our community.

We understand there are 30+ toxic waste sites just in Buncombe County and the County's cost of addressing and cleaning up all of them is enormous......however......what we do not understand is WHY the County, the City, and the State are not addressing the companies that caused the issues. CTE is a viable, very profitable operation situated all over the globe. They have the money put aside for the clean up of their uncounscionable operations and no one in our North Carolina legislature seems to be willing to demand they do it. Not so in California where this was addressed and accomplished. We are having a very difficult time understanding and coming to terms with this reasoning.

This was not the first meeting we attended. We have been to the County Commissioners meeting and the City Council meeting. We have met with our neighbors, have seen documents and heard testimony. The high levels of TCE in the ground water and the vapors in the air have increased, more wells are affected, putting more and more people at risk. This is a documented fact and constitutes an eminent danger. The pollution is spreading and our elected officials, who have vowed to fight for and protect our health and well-being, are sitting on their hands.

Our community, at the very least, needs and deserves CLEAN WATER and CLEAN AIR for all its residents. We expect it.

Respectfully,
Sheila Martin

Ms. Martin,

The sites involved lie outside of city limits and jurisdictional authority.  Nonetheless, Asheville's city council has made an effort to be helpful at points during the process and will likely continue on that course - recognizing our powers are limited in attempting to create meaningful action. 

As regards your expectation of clean water and air, one can certainly appreciate those priorities.  The question remains as to who pays for such. 

The call for extended water lines to compensate for high risk wells certainly resonates - the call to transfer to costs to the city and water users is a point of concern.  Addressing the needs of one victimized group by victimizing another would sidestep the fairness issue that should govern our actions.

I share your belief that ultimate accountability in this matter has not been appropriately resolved.  Until that time, solutions, responsibilities, and costs should be timely but also fairly distributed. 

I will be leaving our Council with a few weeks and will have no likely involvement in future resolutions.  It remains that the fastest track to receiving city services (new water line and system access) will be for those affected to voluntarily become part of the city and share those associated costs.  

I am persistently fascinated with how quickly and enthusiastically so many of us can embrace the pockets of others but hit the pause button when our own pockets are addressed.  The frustrating realities at the CTS site appear to offer no exception.

Carl Mumpower
Asheville City Council

My wife and I have travelled the Dismal Swamp 17 times in the past 10 years on our annual trip South in the Fall to Florida and our return North in The Spring to Philadelphia, PA on our 38 foot sailboat. The trip thru the Dismal with stops at the Welcome Center and at Elizabeth City are some our most favorite parts of the entire trip. Given the history of the Swamp and its beauty it would be a tragedy to suddenly have the Swamp closed to us and the many, many other boaters who travel thru it each year. I enlist your help in maintaining this national treasure, Please contact me if you think that i can be of any further help in this.

Subject: Problems at Scots for Youth

In response to my previous editorial information sent to you regarding Scots for Youth a Scotland County structured day program for youth who been suspended or expeled from school. 

As previously discussed: The inapporiate behaviors of this agency should be public knowledge.

This agencys' Executive Director serves on the local JCPC committee which according to a 2008 state auditors report is a risk, also a JCPC finance committee member who decides on which agencies  will be funded is currently employed by Scots for Youth. This report can reviewed at the link below:
<http://www.ncauditor.net/epsweb/report/performance/per-2008-7234.pdf>http://www.ncauditor.net/epsweb/report/performance/per-2008-7234.pdf

Do non-profits who recieve grants have to be able to meet the cost of day to day operations, such as being able to meet payroll without borrowing money from other county agencies?  The Executive Director of this agency regularly borrows money  from the office of the county manager in order to payroll which means she is not truth about matching funds for grants.    

Middle school and high school youth complain they receive course work at the 3rd grade level, more complaints revealed that staff  bring left overs meals fromt their homes to feed the youth. My question was is this not a health issue and is there funding in the budget to purchase food for program youth? To further add to a bad situation there are little to no stuctured activies for the participating youth. The recitivism rate for this agencys' participating youth tends to be very high although there are very few youth being served.  For the youth who are enrolled the same ones tend to return for services year after. So how many youth are actually being served and why do the same keep returning if they are being helped to develope skills to change negative behaviors?

This agency receives state & federal funding to provide structured activities and services to this counties youth yet how much of the funding is spent on program activities and how is spent on staff salaries?

Finally the main question is shouldn't the community, parents, taxpayers and funders know exactly what services are this agency as well any agency and are they effective?

Sincerly,
Cynthia Mayers

Mr. Mitcher, I am the Correctional Administrator at Polk CI. Your e-mail to the Governor's office in regards to your step-son was referred to my office for review. You are concerned about him being sent to this facility.
Your step-son, Ryan Knox, is 19 years old and was convicted of Common Law Robbery. His sentence is 4 months.
All 19-21 years olds that enter the N.C. Division of Prisons begin at this institution. He is in Processing which is a diagnostic period of time (roughly 2-4 wks.) in which he is evaluated to determine the most appropriate housing. He will remain at Polk CI to the completion of his sentence unless the staff in our Diagnostic section determine that he should be in minimum custody. If that is the case then he would be transferred to a minimum custody facility, provided there is an available bed.  
His initial housing at this facility is standard protocol for all 19-21 year old new admissions and there is no other option. Despite what you may have heard, most inmates get along fine here at Polk. We do our very best to ensure the safety of all inmates. If he encounters a problem he has many staff members he can go to for assistance. 
If you have further questions feel free to contact me.

Dear Mrs. Martin -



On behalf of the Buncombe County Commissioners I am responding to your email regarding the CTS site.



Buncombe County is aware that the CTS site is a documented source of chlorinated solvents (TCE) that have been detected at above regulatory standards in soils on site as well as in groundwater and surface water of nearby springs.  However, applicable federal and State environmental laws afford local governments a very limited role in addressing hazardous substance contamination.  Primary responsibility is vested with the EPA and NC Department of Environment and Natural Resources.  Therefore, Buncombe County is not in a position to require that any particular action be taken by the owners of the site.  All the County can do, as the County Commissioners and staff have done for several years, is "ride herd" on the EPA and DENR as the responsible governing health authorities to ensure that all appropriate measures are taken. 



It is important to remember that the CTS site has been repeatedly evaluated for inclusion on the EPA's National Priorities List (NPL).  This evaluation assesses a score to determine if the site poses a risk to public health deemed high enough to warrant EPA-lead remediation.  However, the site has never scored high enough for inclusion on the NPL.  Presently, there is no known well that has tested positive for TCE in the area that is serving any home.  All homes that were served by any well that has tested positive for TCE are now on city water. 



EPA has compelled the responsible parties, CTS and Mills Gap Assoc., to complete a removal action.  The Responsible Parties are CTS and Mills Gap Associates.  These are the current and former owners.  The County is not in a position to control any clean up of this site. 



At this time another risk assessment is underway, but responsible federal authorities have not released the results.  The County Commissioners have just recently made another request that this report be made public immediately. 



The County has no standing to file legal action against the owners of the site , the Secretary of DENR, or the EPA. (See G/S. 130A-310.5).  Liability for these sites is statutory, and Buncombe is not in that loop.  The County is not in the business of hazardous wastes except as permitted by the State.  Buncombe County is largely preempted by statute [130A-293] and would be liable, as would any person or business entity, as an owner/operator, generator or transporter of the hazardous material. [130A-310.7].  Further, only DENR, through its Secretary, can officially designate when an imminent hazard exists. [130A-310.5]   Of course, EPA could do likewise, but only if the site scored as an NPL site, and this has not happened. 



Finally, only one statute specifically gives a local official any authority that might be used to compel a clean up.  N.C.G.S. §130A-19 provides that if a local health director, or DENR Secretary, determines that a "public health nuisance" exists, they may issue an order of abatement directing that necessary action be taken to abate to public health nuisance.  The phrase "public health nuisance" is not defined in the statute.  If the party refuses to take action then a suit may be instituted in Superior Court to enforce the order.  A local health official has taken such action in North Carolina only once.  Cumberland County's health director did so in concert with DENR when contaminates from an abandoned textile facility made its way into groundwater and a contaminant plume was migrating toward the water treatment facility.  So, that health director did not go it alone.  Here, no risk assessment has been completed.  Before such a drastic measure can be considered we would need a risk assessment concluding that a contaminate plume has created an imminent health risk, and then consult with DENR about what further enforcement actions it plans to take.  This would tie in with our policy on infrastructure expenses. 



Further questions and concerns related to this site may be forwarded to the responsible governing health authorities or elected officials.



Thank you.

Subject: CTS Toxic Waste Site




My husband and I are voting residents of Asheville and we attended a meeting last week at the Skyland Fire Department. This meeting concerned the CTS TOXIC WASTE SITE on Mills Gap Road. We live approximately 1 mile from this site and we are concerned about our community.



We understand there are 30+ toxic waste sites just in Buncombe County and the County's cost of addressing and cleaning up all of them is enormous......however......what we do not understand is WHY the County, the City, and the State are not addressing the companies that caused the issues. CTE is a viable, very profitable operation situated all over the globe. They have the money put aside for the clean up of their uncounscionable operations and no one in our North Carolina legislature seems to be willing to demand they do it. Not so in California where this was addressed and accomplished. We are having a very difficult time understanding and coming to terms with this reasoning.



This was not the first meeting we attended. We have been to the County Commissioners meeting and the City Council meeting. We have met with our neighbors, have seen documents and heard testimony. The high levels of TCE in the ground water and the vapors in the air have increased, more wells are affected, putting more and more people at risk. This is a documented fact and constitutes an eminent danger. The pollution is spreading and our elected officials, who have vowed to fight for and protect our health and well-being, are sitting on their hands.



Our community, at the very least, needs and deserves CLEAN WATER and CLEAN AIR for all its residents. We expect it.



Respectfully,

Sheila Martin

It seems to me that we should let them know that in seeking legal advice they have taken the appropriate action, since we have no authority over matters in South Carolina.

> Comment: 20 September 2009 To Whom It May Concern: We are writing this letter in reference to some injustices, corruption, and ridiculous allegations done to a doctor who is a distinguished , very knowledgeable, and honest man, who has served our country as a family physician in the civilian side as well as and in the Army ,as an officer, and would like to serve again. We have wrote letters, attempted to attain many attorneys throughout the state of South Carolina. We are recently trying to attain some counsel from the state of North Carolina in which we reside in currently. We have contacted SLED, the South Carolina governors office, numerous attorneys on several occasion , with no results. We have wrote and emailed governors, senators, government officials, congressmen and such also with no responses or with the most common, sorry to inform you we do not handle these sorts of issues, and would be brushed off to yet another unwilling to help official. We know that part of his mishaps are from involving himself with the wrong people. The bulk of his tribulations stem from his reporting of major cocaine and drug traffickersâ€™ from Clarendon and surrounding counties and his lack of cooperation with racist and discriminatory populace at Clarendon Memorial Hospital and several other highly recognized public officials and or offices. These citizens have managed to have his medical license temporarily suspended, several times, shut his business down, and leave him with no personal property. Currently they are trying to incarcerate him due to astronomical amounts of child supports and alimonies, one to which the marriage did not last a year ,due to his spouses drug abuse and addiction. On one occasion some personal belongings were stolen from him and the local sheriff at the time sold them for personal gain. In result due to the Judges, law enforcement, local attorneys, and the inability to get any help from our government or officials they have continuously harassed and conspired to use the system, to which they seem to own, to incapacitated him. Where is the justice? Who is there for people such as he? How much does one American have to endure? What happen to the land of opportunity? Freedom? Fair Rights? Equal Opportunity? We Thank Any Help With Any of These Issues, God Bless! David T. Koon, M.D. 169 Ribbon Oak Court Sanford, N.C. 27332 sfmdtk@yahoo.com

Subject: New Law You Signed

Comment: What good is your new law to protect children from being bullied, denied opportunities & retaliation??? There is no one in the school system or outside the school system to enforce this law or see that the child's best interest is being protected. The entire system will listen sympathetically to your child's story & then join in on the bullying of your child. They will claim they conducted a "thorough" investigation when all they really did is walk away or look away or worse join in to let your child & others know what will happen if you voice a complaint_things will get worse, opportunities will be denied & they will retaliate because they can. There is no one in the school to protect your child, there is no representative in your community to protect your child & even lawyers will tell you what you already know, "it's a good old boy system" right through the court system. Schools are supposed to be safe & foster children's dreams. Your new law is a useless piece of paper if you have no outside system in place to assure that the child is getting what's in their best interest. At present schools go to great length to protect their own, even when they know the employee has a history of child abuse. At present your law is ignored because school officials don't think they have to comply & why should they, no one is looking. No one will ever know they mistreated my child or any others because there is no system to make schools accountable to do the right thing for the child.

Subject: Health Emergency a Threat to My Health, Freedom

Comment: A Petition to the President of the United States Dear President Obama, You have promised us a government of transparency. Your October 23, 2009 Declaration of Health Emergency is not only not transparent, it presents a clear and present danger to me personally and to our Constitutional form of government. I am writing to you today to exercise my rights under the First Amendment Constitution of These United States for the redress of grievances. Your Declaration of Health Emergency on October 23, 2009 gives appointed officials illegal, and unconstitutional powers which threaten my life, liberty and well-being in a clear and present way. This Petition urges you to remove this threat from me and my fellow Americans immediately since its only possible reason for being is to use the medical system to abridge my liberties. I am writing to you at the suggestion of the Natural Solutions Foundation, a preeminent Health Freedom organization. Other decision makers are receiving copies of this Petition. They include Secretaries Sebelius, Napolitano, the Governor of my State, my State Legislators and my Federal Legislators. They, and I, strongly challenge and oppose your declaration of a "Swine Flu Health Emergency" in the absence of science or clinical reality. Political issues and a desire to curtail all Constitutional rights appear to be driving this unwarranted and excessive exuberance to push dangerous and untested vaccines and provide for internment and forced treatment. I fear that the same kind of "eugenicide" now being practiced as cost containment-mediated death strategies in the UK will be used to reduce the costly population of such medical gulags. Given the co-option of medical systems in recent genocides, this is not an unlikely outcome to this policy. I urge you, Sir, to reverse your policy and your position as Secretaries Napolitano and Sebelius have already done both in statements and before Congress concerning any "Health Emergency". There is none. The danger here is from the unwarranted powers given to Secretary Sebelius. As an American, I value the Constitutional rights that you are sworn to protect and which you, as a Constitutional scholar, well understand. I am stunned and dismayed by your pronouncement of a National Health Emergency on October 23, 2009, regarding the 2009-H1N1-A "Swine Flu", given the following facts: - According to Health and Human Services Secretary Sebelius' announcement on October 21, 2009, and her Congressional testimony the following day, the incidence of H1N1 Swine Flu will peak in the next week - 40% of the population has already been infected - The arrival of the $6.4 Billion dollars' worth of vaccine, including $485 million dollars of unapproved, injectable squalene designed to serve as an external adjuvant, will come "too late" to provide any protection against the Swine Flu. - More than $485 million dollars of a dangerous, untested and unapproved adjuvant, squalene, has been purchased for injection well in advance of the first appearance of the supposedly novel Swine Flu in April - Neither squalene itself nor its proprietary versions are approved for injection into humans - Good Manufacturing Practices make it impossible to admix squalene at the 90,000 inoculation sites now being set up around the country. The extreme danger such a variation from proper medical manufacturing practice standards should be obvious. -Squalene, at the high doses found in both the Novartis and GSK approved vaccines, and in the admixture program announced on the FDA's website, causes, in the presence of glycoproteins, an irreversible infertility because of immune system stimulation. The human body is rich in glycoproteins, including hormones necessary for fertility. -Incarceration at sites remote from hospitals, administered through medical systems, which your declaration allows, is a position very far down the slope of medical systems being co-opted into participation with extermination programs which we have seen all too recently. -No redress, appeal or other Habeas Corpus remedies are provided for under the powers available to the Secretary in your Declaration making these powers unconstitutional. The facts, reported by your Secretary in a Press Conference on September 20 and again before Congress on September 21, 2009 make it very clear that the alleged intense danger cited of a "Swine Flu" outbreak prior to her announcement and testimony is no longer a reality, making your Declaration unnecessary. If your Declaration was intended to legalize the bizarely dangerous admixing of adjuvant and vaccine outside of pharmaceutical or medical facilities, you must take full responsibility for the resulting harm. Not even, however, in a declared emergency can any national authority allow the violation of basic medical standards nor their distortion into the administrative and action arms of incarceration and extermination policies. I petition you as Chief Executive to abide by the restraints and protections afforded me by the Constitution of These United States, the legislative and regulatory protections afforded me in consequence of the Constitution and, indeed, the basic standards of civilized behavior with regard to medical treatment, In short, I appeal to you to stop this madness now! Further, the case numbers cited by the CDC, as with those cited by the World Health Organization, are based in speculation, not science. The WHO and CDC asked countries, states and counties to cease counting cases of "Swine Flu" several months ago since laboratory confirmation was inaccurate at least 90% of the time, making any morbidity and mortality numbers meaningless. A recent study, conducted over the past 3 months by CBS found that Swine Flu "cases" were inaccurately diagnosed between 83 and 97% of the time (average inaccuracy rate: 90%) which is consistent with the FDA's and CDC's announcements in the past several months that accurate diagnosis was not possible 90% of the time, making the effort to achieve such diagnosis meaningless and futile. In the complete absence of any accurate morbidity and mortality data, and in the presence of a stated peak of this coming week, followed by the logically necessary decline in even estimated cases, there is not now, nor has there ever been, a health emergency that would give you the authority to make the Declaration you have made. What there has been, Mr. President, is a shamefully deceptive marketing campaign to defraud the American people and those around the world who look to our good science (here absent), our good public policy (here absent as well) and our good sense (nowhere currently in evidence concerning this "pandemic"). Instead, 5 vaccines which are dangerous and totally untested have been approved in the total absence of any information on their specific safety profiles while we know that their principle components are dangerous in themselves. Two of these vaccines are, in contradiction to the testimony of Secretary Sebelius on September 15, 2009, adjuvanted with highly toxic substances. Medimmune's Live Attenuated Influenza Virus nasal mist vaccines are associated with profoundly unacceptable adverse events including meningitis, Guillan-Barre Syndrome, sudden death and a host of other documented dangers including a documented overall three fold increase in hospitalizations for all causes in children who receive them. Secretary Sebelius stated in her testimony before Congress on September 15, 2009 that these four approved vaccines are not adjuvanted (extended with the use of immune system irritants). In fact, the other three vaccines approved at that time, all without any testing, contained aluminum (a potent neurotoxin adjuvant) and, in the case of the Novartis vaccine, according to Novartis itself, MF59, its proprietary squalene adjuvant. However, your Department of Health and Human Services did not know, when we discussed this with the Secretary's office, what MF59 contains and told us to check that with Novartis. We did. They pointed us to a web page that said the "oil in water" adjuvant was "proprietary" -- so the government doesn't even know what is in the vaccine it approved! According to our information, Mr. President, another vaccine has been added to the roster of "Swine Flu" vaccines for this non-event of a "Public Health Emergency": GSK's oil and water and aluminum adjuvanted vaccine. This was the fifth vaccine which your government purchased, but could not approve because, as Secretary Sebelius testified, "our scientists don't want us to go down that road..." If your Declaration was intended to legalize the use of this dangerous, unapprovable drug, you must accept full responsibility for the harm it will cause. Whether injected either through on-site admixture or in-vial contents, squalene is the undisputed source of profound disability and, in a high percentage of cases, death from the pervasive and irreversible auto-immune disorder it precipitates. "Breaking tolerance", or stimulating the immune system to attack its own body - eventually in every tissue, is, in fact, what injected squalene is used for in the laboratory, where it is known as "Freund's Complete Adjuvant" after its discoverer, Dr. Jules Freund. The disorders it causes in experimental animals are so profound and debilitating that there is considerable debate in the scientific community over whether it can ever be used ethicially within the boundaries of humane animal experimentation. In humans, these disorders are known collectively as "Gulf War Syndrome" which felled and eventually killed more than 25% of the healthy young service men and women into whom it was experimentally injected - and still is being used. The doses of squalene being used in the Swine Flu vaccines and admixtures are one million times stronger, in line with the 1998 patents which show that such doses will create sterility in those who receive them. Mr. President, this means that an entire generation of children and fertile adults (the pregnant women in the high risk group of first vaccine recipients) will be rendered sterile. This constitutes willful negligence on the part of the US Government, its agents and all manufacturers. No wonder vaccine makers and the US Government are eager to see these vaccines administered quickly, before any formal safety testing has been done. There is more grievance that I urge you to redress, Mr. President: all multiple dose vials contain one of the most potent neurotoxins known to man: mercury in the form of Eli Lilly's creation, Thimerisol. This product was grandfathered in on the Generally Regarded As Safe ("GRAS") list after one of the most shameful travesties of scientific investigation ever perpetrated this side of the Nazi concentration camps: 22 patients in coma from meningitis were injected with thimerisol, which is 49.6% pure mercury by weight. All of the patients died. Lilly reported out to the newly formed FDA that Thimerisol did not harm the patients because "they would have died from other causes anyway". The Agency accepted this obvious assault on logic, truth and decency and we have been facing the tragic results of neurological poisonings in our children's - and our - syringes since the early 1930's. Mr. President, you are a father. The precious daughters whom you cherish could be destroyed by these vaccines, yet there is no danger to them from the Declared Public Health Emergency. You clearly see that because you have not chosen to submit their young bodies to these vaccines despite the fact that the CDC and FDA have declared them to be in the highest risk group for Swine Flu: healthy children. We therefore petition you to issue another Declaration to make it clear that no person shall be mandated to receive any of these vaccines under any conditions and to rescind your current Declaration so that the medical system is not used to create gulags. You have full control of the issue now, by your Declaration, and must therefore accept full responsibility: will you force Americans to receive these drugs and accept medical internment without Constitutional or scientific justification or will you affirm our right to free choice in these matters and rescind your dangerous and unnecessary Declaration? The other highest risk groups, pregnant women and people with chronic diseases, are at highest risk for damage, often irreversible, from these vaccines. This irreversible damage includes death all too often, as the emerging data in Sweden, Hungary and other countries using GSK's squalene adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine are demonstrating right now, following early vaccinations in those countries. There are other dangers, Mr. President, in vaccinating against a non-existant threat. Under the best of circumstances, using the most favorable of assumptions, the FDA estimates that at least, at LEAST, Mr. President, 30,000 people will die from the vaccines and at least 100,000 will suffer serious adverse events. That is not an inconsequential estimate, Sir. In fact, there is not one whit of scientific evidence to demonstrate that the desired antibody titer of 40:1 has any protective value against the Swine Flu, or that any other flu vaccine has any protective value against any flu and, for that matter, the necessary (and widely assumed to be present) double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or the long term follow up studies demonstrating long term safety are absent, as well. Moreover, there is grave danger to the future of your Country and mine, Mr. President, because of the use of the AS02,3,4 and MF59 adjuvants at all and especially in the doses in which they are being injected into our youngest, fertile and most vulnerable population. I am gravely concerned that the WHO, which required that the oil and water adjuvants be put into the vaccines which have been produced in the absence of either safety or sense, and at doses 1,000,000 times that present in the dangerous experimental Vaccine A will, in the presence of both naturally occurring and introduced glycoproteins (richly present in the human body), produce an immune-mediated, irreversible sterility. And I am concerned that the US will help them in this long-sought, but genocidal destruction of global fertility. Surely you know that the education of females, in every culture, is the surest way to a substantial reduction in birth rate while the quality of life of the community these women live in rises dramatically along every parameter. If your concern is for well-being on either a local or a global basis, why is the global education of girls and women not your priority? Given that the WHO has been working vigorously on infertility vaccines through its special commissions since 1974, and has deployed them against third world populations in every part of the world, and given that two patents filed in 1998 make such permanent and irreversible sterility an irreversible consequence of these adjuvanted injections, I have grave concerns for the continued ability of the US population to reproduce. Given also that the World Health Organization has stated that massive population reduction, which is in line with the stated goals of US Foreign Policy for global population reduction, the use of these dangerous vaccines on pregnant women and children FIRST is of overwhelming concern to me and must be to you as well, Mr. President. The Department of Health and Human Services Secretary, Janet Napolitano, stated on October 23, 2009 that there would be no economic consequences to the Swine Flu in the US. On October 22, 2009, the Governor of New York State rescinded the mandatory vaccine health care worker mandate placed upon those workers on 2 months earlier citing "vaccine shortages". The only economic impacts which will result from this Swine Flu non-pandemic are the waste of $6.4 billion dollars in a severely damaged economy and the loss of the inestimable income to the illness care industry which the chronic, degenerative and disabling diseases caused by these vaccines would generate. Your daughters are unvaccinated, Sir, as are you. Surely if there were a health emergency, you and your family would be treated with a meaningful preventive strategy which differed in no way from that offered to other Americans and might, indeed, exceed that available to others. I believe that your lack of vaccination is, in fact, a superior health care strategy reserved for the powerful. In Germany, politicians like you have exempted themselves and members of the military from adjuvanted vaccines decreeing, at the same time, that the rest of the German population is to receive vaccines with adjuvants. Are we secretly playing that game, Mr. President, with the lives and the health of every American, or is the game plan that the powerful and their children, including your own, will abstain from the dangerous "treatment" forced upon the rest of us? The irrational haste with which inoculation of unsafe, untested, unnecessary and uninsurable Swine Flu vaccines has moved forward seems to me to correspond with the veil of immunity which manufacturers, the Federal Government and their agents which prevents any tort or other liability for dangerous, or even deadly, vaccines unless those companies, agencies and person act with willful negligence. Once the safety testing has been carried out, and the dangers of the vaccines have been abundantly document, their use would likely constitute "willful negligence", leaving all involved organisms, both corporate, private and government, liable to enormous damages from the grieving and ill patients and parents who were damaged by this vaccination program. There is no Health Emergency to declare, nor has there ever been. To make it even slightly plausible to declare a Level 6 pandemic on June 11, the World Health Organization had to eliminate the concepts of a novel agent causing widespread serious disease and death from the definition of "Pandemic". This "Pandemic" is a non-threat. The vaccines, and the distortions involved in manipulating the people of the United States and, through its leadership, the rest of the world, are the real dangers and they are considerable. I have signed this letter, Mr. President, in order to petition for a redress of the grievances which you are overseeing and which you have perpetrated through your Declaration of Health Emergency on October 23, 2009. I urge you in the strongest terms to abandon a strategy based on failed science and dangerous consequences of unprecedented proportion. My future, America's future and the future of freedom depend on it. You have chosen to transform a non-pandemic which was, by your own Secretary's testimony, peaking next week, into a nation emergency. You must therefore now show us that you will treat this process with the transparency you have repeatedly promised the American people and the world. Will you tell us that we need to sacrifice more of our freedom for some alleged pandemic security, or will you now publicly affirm that none of the vaccines covered by the Declaration shall be forced upon any person, by mandate, or by threat to withhold public benefits, jobs and schooling? Will you incarcerate us in medical gulags or will you allow us to move freely without the fear of medical concentration camps, detention centers and eugenicide? The entire nation, and because of the position of leadership which the US has earned in the past, the entire world, awaits your answers will hold you accountable. Is your legacy to be our illness, sterility and death through dangerous drugs which have no medical reason for their use? I look forward to your unequivocal response in restoring freedom and sanity to the man-made debacle confronting us. Rescind your Declaration of Health Emergency and officially end the Swine Flu Pandemic. Yours in health and freedom,

ED REVIEW

November 13, 2009



...a bi-weekly update on U.S. Department of Education activities relevant to the Intergovernmental and Corporate community and other stakeholders

______________________________________________________________________

ARRA OUTREACH (RACE TO THE TOP)



On November 4, in anticipation of this week’s announcement of Race to the Top’s final application, President Obama and Secretary Duncan visited James C. Wright Middle School in Madison, Wisconsin.  “In the coming weeks, states will be able to compete for what we’re calling a Race to the Top award,” the President explained.  “We’re putting over $4 billion on the table, one of the largest investments that the federal government has ever made in education reform.  But we’re not just handing it out to states….  We’re staying to states, if you’re committed to real change in the way you educate your children, if you’re willing to hold yourselves more accountable, and if you develop a strong plan to improve the quality of education in your state, then we’ll offer you a big grant to help you make that plan a reality….  And, I’m proud to say that, already, a number of states have taken us up on this challenge” (see <http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/fact-sheet-race-top>http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/fact-sheet-race-top).  The President used the remainder of his remarks to “get into some details” about Race to the Top’s four key measures of reform: designing and implementing rigorous standards and high-quality assessments; attracting and retaining great teachers and leaders; supporting data systems that inform decisions and improve instruction; and using innovation and effective approaches to turn-around struggling schools.  “Don’t just expect teachers to set a high bar,” he stressed.  “It will take parents and teachers unions and elected officials working together as partners in a common effort -- not seeing each other as antagonists, but all of us having the same goal.  It will take each and every one of us doing our part on behalf of our children and our country and the future we share.”  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2009/11/04/high-expectations-0>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2009/11/04/high-expectations-0.



Then, yesterday (November 12), the Secretary released the final application for the Race to the Top Fund, which will reward states that have raised student performance and have the capacity to accelerate achievement gains with innovative reforms.  The final application includes significant changes to the proposal from the Department in July.  After reviewing responses to the draft proposal from 1,161 people, who submitted thousands of unique comments, the Department restructured the application and changed it to reflect the ideas of the public.  The Department will hold two rounds of competition for these grants.  For the first round, it will accept states’ applications until January 19, 2010.  Peer reviewers will evaluate the applications, and the winners will be announced in April.  For the second round, it will accept states’ applications until June 1, and all the winners will be announced by September 30.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/>http://www.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/.  (Note: Aside from the application, the web site has an executive summary of the program and a helpful summary of the significant changes that were based on comments received.  Also, the Department intends to host two technical assistance planning workshops in December.  One will be in Denver on December 3, 2009; the other will be in the Washington, D.C., area on December 10, 2009.)

______________________________________________________________________

ARRA OUTREACH (STABILIZATION FUND)



Also this week, the Secretary announced the availability of applications for the second and final phase of the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF).  “The Department has moved quickly to award more than $67 billion in education stimulus aid to date to stabilize state budgets and save jobs,” he said.  “We are now asking states to implement reform-based action items in order to get the remaining $11.5 billion.”



Specifically, the Department is asking states to provide basic information on the four key measures of reform, including:

·         How teachers and principals are evaluated, and how this information is used to support, retain, promote, or remove staff.

·         The extent to which the state has a statewide longitudinal data system that includes the elements prescribed by the America COMPETES Act and how it will implement a comprehensive system by 2011.

·         Whether the state provides student achievement growth data on current students and students taught in the previous year to, at a minimum, teachers of reading/language arts and math, in grades in which the state administers assessments in those subjects, in a manner that is both timely and informs instructional programs.

·         The number and identity of the schools that are Title I schools in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring that are identified as persistently lowest-achieving schools.



State applications must describe the state’s current ability to collect the data or other information needed, as well as the state’s current ability to make the data or information easily available to the public.  If the state is able to fully collect and publicly report the required data or other information at least annually, the state must furnish the most recent data or information with its plan.  If a state is not able to fully collect or publicly report the data or other information at least annually, the plan must describe the state’s process and timeline for developing and implementing the means to do so -- as soon as possible, but no later than September 30, 2011.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.ed.gov/programs/statestabilization/applicant.html>http://www.ed.gov/programs/statestabilization/applicant.html.

______________________________________________________________________

ARRA OUTREACH (REPORTING)



On October 30, in reports covering approximately $160 billion (representing about half of the funds put to work through September 30, 2009), American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) recipients informed the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board that they have created or saved 640,329 direct jobs. These reports support government and private forecasters’ estimates that the ARRA has created or saved, overall, an estimated one million jobs.  The majority of the jobs reported were in the construction (about 80,000 jobs) and education (about 325,000 jobs) sectors.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/new-recipient-reports-confirm-recovery-act-has-created-saved-over-one-million-jobs->http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/new-recipient-reports-confirm-recovery-act-has-created-saved-over-one-million-jobs-.



In a separate report, the Department describes each of the ARRA education grants and their allocations.  The report also contains a profile of each state that summarizes any restoration of education budgets by ARRA funds per program and compiles all reported information regarding the state’s use of ARRA funds per program.  To summarize: over $67 million in formula grants were awarded by the Department as of September 30, 2009.  Roughly 400,000 jobs have been created or saved through these formula grants.  Of those, 325,000 are education jobs; the remaining portion is attributable to general public service positions.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/recovery/spending/impact.html>http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/recovery/spending/impact.html.

______________________________________________________________________

ECONOMIC SECURITY



More recently, Secretary Duncan addressed the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s annual Education and Workforce Summit.  This wide-ranging speech hit on many topics, such as the federal role in education, the compelling case for reforming education at every level (featuring a range of important indicators), and the core ideas that are central to reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).  “I believe that the quality of our education system says as much about the long-term health of our economy as the stock market, the unemployment rate, and the size of the gross domestic product,” he stated.  “That’s because the quality of our workforce and the intellectual breadth and depth of our future leaders is directly related to the quality of education we provide today.”  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/2009/11/11092009.html>http://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/2009/11/11092009.html.



At the summit, the Chamber released the second in its “Leaders and Laggards” series of state report cards.  The report cards examine the 50 states and the District of Columbia in eight categories: school management, finance, staffing: hiring and evaluation, staffing: removing ineffective teachers, data, pipeline to postsecondary, technology, and state reform environment.  Overall, the states posted mediocre results, and, across all the categories, not a single state earned top grades in more than one or two areas.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.uschamber.com/reportcard/>http://www.uschamber.com/reportcard/.

______________________________________________________________________

COMING UP TALLER



First Lady Michelle Obama, honorary chair of the President’s Committee on Arts and Humanities, has presented 15 programs from around the world with the Coming Up Taller Award.  Bestowed to arts and humanities organizations that reach underserved youth, the award is a reminder of the meaningful role cultural activities in the lives of children.  This year’s recipients include the Shakespeare Remix program in New York City, where inner-city teens adapt and perform Shakespearean texts to reflect their lives, and the Harmony Project in Los Angeles, which provides free music instruction to at-risk children.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.pcah.gov/news/CUT09Obama.htm>http://www.pcah.gov/news/CUT09Obama.htm. ______________________________________________________________________

ODDS AND ENDS



·         Last week, capitalizing on advanced technology, Secretary Duncan and Jordanian Minister of Education Waleed Ali-Ma’ani lead students from the U.S. and Jordan in a two-way video exchange on climate change (<http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2009/11/05/kansas-cairo>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2009/11/05/kansas-cairo), and the Secretary and NASA Administrator Charles Bolden joined local students for a live discussion (questions were asked in English, Russian, French, and German) with the crew aboard the International Space Station (<http://anon.nasa-global.edgesuite.net/anon.nasa-global/ccvideos/education_astronaut.asx>http://anon.nasa-global.edgesuite.net/anon.nasa-global/ccvideos/education_astronaut.asx).

·         Also last week, the Secretary joined military leaders to discuss the importance of early learning in improving a child’s chances for success in life, whether choosing college, the workforce, or the military.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.missionreadiness.org/>http://www.missionreadiness.org/.

·         Then, this week, the Secretary delivered remarks on “The Promise of Promise Neighborhoods” at a Harlem Children’s Zone meeting: <http://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/2009/11/11102009.html>http://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/2009/11/11102009.html.

·         Preceding the White House Tribal Nations Conference (<http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2009/11/05/white-house-tribal-nations-conference>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2009/11/05/white-house-tribal-nations-conference), Assistant Secretary for Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development Carmel Martin and Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education Thelma Melendez met with Tribal leaders at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian to discuss reauthorization of the ESEA.

·         To improve preparedness in response to the H1N1 flu outbreak, the Department has issued guidance under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) to answer questions that school officials may have concerning the disclosure of personally identifiable information from students’ education records to outside entities when facing a outbreak.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/pdf/ferpa-h1n1.pdf>http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/pdf/ferpa-h1n1.pdf.

·         In accordance with Section 111 of the Higher Education Opportunity Act, the Department’s Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) issued a net price calculator template.  All institutions participating in student financial aid programs have two years to implement use of the template on their web sites or develop a customized version that must include, at a minimum, the same elements as the Department’s version.  Utilizing both student-entered and institution-provided data, the template allows prospective students to calculate a net price at an institution using the following basic formula: price of attendance minus grant aid.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE GO TO <http://npc.inovas.net/institution/>http://npc.inovas.net/institution/.

QUOTE TO NOTE



“For much of the past year, I have spent time highlighting our challenges.  I have been to 32 states and hundreds of schools in cities, suburbs, and rural communities.  I have met with thousands of students, parents, and teachers….  They know what’s wrong.  And, they know what has to change.  Now, we need to come together around the solutions.  Thus, today, I extend my hand in partnership to the Chamber and, more broadly, to the business community.  I ask for your help, your input, your ideas, and your support.  I need your members across America to take a more active role in education reform.”



-- Secretary of Education Arne Duncan (11/9/09), speaking at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce

Subject: [Aid4Mail Trial tag #5537] Violence against women and children-an epidemic in the world!!!

Dear Governor Perdue,

     The violence on women and children have now reached epidemic 
proportions and I have been signing petitions now to the UN regarding 
this matter. The violence, murders, rapes and domestic violence-are out 
of control, because our justice system has not allowed these men to 
recevive the Professional help they need. What I have experienced was 
not just for my becoming stronger, but to help others be free and live 
a quality of life. The Pitt County Courts and Law Enforcement has 
failed to help me but God, the highest judge on earth, has intervened 
to keep me safe, and as I pray for others, He will also rescue them 
also. I rise an advocate for justice and righteosness, to fight for the 
rights of the oppressed, weak and helpless, as God as commanded me to 
do, and "If I perish, I perish!"
   A young lady only 18 years old ran into my car on my way from 
Greensboro on Saturday, where I was worshipping and praying with over 
11,000 women, at a Women of Faith event, and I have sustained neck and 
upper back injuries, but was able to drive home. I have been mistreated 
by Health Care Professionals in the past and still presently, so I did 
not feel comfortable going to the ER. I have been seen by both a nurse 
practitioner and chiropractor, and will trust God only for my healing. 
Only God knows if this was another attempt on my life, He is the best 
witness, and the officer who came on the scene went to the other car 
first, yet I called 911=three times, and I was the one with damage to 
my car and also injured. I am yet to see his report.
   The Pitt County Courts did not renew my restraining order, hoping my 
ex-husband would eventually take my life, but I do not die until God 
allows it, and God will keep him subdued and reform him also. That's 
how you fight crime and violence, on your knees, because the true enemy 
is spiritual, so only spiritual strategies, can be used coupled with 
mental and physical, to overcome Satan!
   My mom died in 2005-November 5th, and my brother 2008, both were 
mentally ill, America played a role in their deaths in Jamaica, and I 
have to forgive all involved and continue to pray for this nation to 
realise

                                               "God in us is infinite 
wisdom!"

   I am willing to die for Christ's name, and I get so many prayer 
requests of Christians being persecuted, raped, placed in jail, even by 
Police officers, and God is now intervening on their behalf. Those whom 
God has placed on the earth to help the Governments throughout the 
earth, must not be harmed, harrassed or killed, it will make God very 
angry!!! We are here to help the government, the Law Enforcement, the 
Military, by praying and supporting their needs-be it mental, physical 
or spiritual, so we must instead collaborate and work together to truly 
fight the real enemy amongst us-the devil. Visit OpenDoorsUSA and voice 
of the Martyrs for more information on the Persecuted Church! Novemebr 
8th,2009 was International Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church!!
   Jesus is coming soon and spoke about these crisises we now face, 
prior to His return. I rise to get as many people into God's Kingdom, 
as others are doing, and if I die serving Christ, then I know my work 
was not in vain. My experiences in life training ground, so I can now 
rise to help others be free in Christ, and not be fearful, but to be 
bold and courageous. God has told me in His word, not to fear:

                 "For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of 
love. power and a sound mind!"

   I will heal, and will continue to pray for others to heal, but please 
know it will cost nations a lot of money, if they continue to persecute 
Christians, for God can " whip a storm anytime, anywhere and anyhow He 
wants" through wind, fire, rain and shakings-earthquakes- so let us 
instead partner with God, become joint-heirs with Him, and accomplish 
His will here on earth. This will lead to protection, discernment, 
blessings and healing for our country.

May God bless you all, may God bless America and the world!!

Your's sincerely,
Stephanie Grey

I make it a point to say Merry Christmas, after all, Christ is the reason for celebrating Christmas.  Hope you feel the same way & do not mind letting it be known.



Subject: FW: Merry Christmas



 Merry Christmas - please read


Twas the month before  Christmas*
*When all through our  land,*
 *Not a Christian was praying* 
*Nor taking a stand.*
*See the PC Police had taken away,* 
*The reason for Christmas; why, no one could say.* 

*The children were  told by their schools not to sing,* 
*About Shepherds and Wise Men and Angels
and  things.* 

*It might hurt  people's feelings, the teachers would say* 
* December 25th is just a ' Holiday'.* 
*Yet the shoppers were ready with cash,
checks and credit* 

*Pushing folks down to  the floor just to get it!* 

*CDs from Madonna, an  X BOX, an I-pod* 
*Something was  changing, something quite odd! *
*Retailers promoted Ramadan andKwanzaa* 
*In hopes to sell books by Franken & Fonda.* 
*As Targets were hanging their trees upside down*

 At Lowe's the word  Christmas - was no where to be found.* 
*At K-Mart and Staples and Penny's and Sears*
*You won't hear the word Christmas; it won't touch your ears.* 

*Inclusive, sensitive,  Di-ver-si-ty* 

 *Are words that were  used to intimidate me.* 

*Now Daschle, Now  Darden, Now Sharpton, Wolf Blitzen* 
*On Boxer, on Rather, on Kerry, on Clinton !* 
*At the top of the Senate, there arose such
 a  clatter* 

*To eliminate Jesus,  in all public matter.* 

*And we spoke not a  word, as they took away our faith* 
* Forbidden to speak of salvation and grace* 
*The true Gift of Christmas was exchanged
 and  discarded*

 *The reason for the  season, stopped before it started.*
*So as you celebrate 'Winter Break'
 under your 'Dream  Tree'* 

*Sipping your  Starbucks, listen to me.* 

*Choose your words  carefully, choose what you say* 
*Shout MERRY CHRISTMAS ,  not Happy Holiday !* 
Please, all Christians join together and 
wish everyone you meet during the  holidays a 
MERRY  CHRISTMAS 

Christ is The Reason 
for the Christ-mas Season!

Dear Rep. Shuler:

Western NC has a desperate need to attract jobs, and your backing of HR 1409 is extremely counter-productive.  You will simply stop new firms from coming here, and cause some existing firms to close their doors.  WAKE UP about this!

In my past days I’ve been both a union worker and non-union shop worker.  I remember a union meeting, held in the basement of a tavern.  Off to one side was the regional union guy in a sharkskin suit, quietly sitting and constantly eyeing the crowd; intimidating.  I remember talking to fellow workers; they had no damned idea whatsoever about the need for efficiency, etc.  Instead, they were mostly awake to methods of “beating the system.”  And, they had a shill in the audience who would ALWAYS make a loud and emotional comment about some (trumped up) safety hazard, concluding that if it wasn’t for the UNION the damned company would just as soon kill us all.  Most of my older fellow workers, who bothered to attend, just sat there and let the BS happen.  When a critical point was raised, the union President would brush it aside, concluding with something like, “Let’s not worry about that, and get done, so we can go up to the bar and have a drink.”

I’m not saying that all non-union shops are terrible.  In fact, many are more caring and humane, and often profit sharing, than union shops which, over time, tend to descend into warring camps.

Please change your mind on this!

Sincerely,

Bob

”The trouble with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.” - Margaret Thatcher  “Wants” become “Needs” then “Rights” & exceed any tax-ability to pay for them.)

"You cannot legislate the poor into freedom by legislating the wealthy out of freedom. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving. The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.

“When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that my dear friend, is about the end of any nation. You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it."  -- Dr. Adrian Rogers (1931-2005)

Subject: On Right to Work

Frankly, I'm fed up with Heath Shulers' faux conservative gambit.  In response to a request that he support Right to Work in NC by voting against the, so called, "Employee Free Choice Act" I received the usual canned letter spouting union propaganda.  It's time to take off the gloves with this guy.  My answer to him follows:

This is in response to your boiler plate letter supporting the Employee Free Choice Act (a canard if their ever was one), H.R. 1409 is not representative of your North Carolina Constituents. This is a Right to Work State and the freedom to work without Union Suppression of individual rights is one of the few advantages NC has to attract industry to this state.

The Union Bosses are demanding Card Check because they know that the secret ballot is the only thing that enables workers to avoid harassment and intimidation by Union Organizers. H.R. 1409 does just the opposite of your claim of restoring workers rights to join a union; rather, it will force people into paying union dues just to keep their jobs.

Further, your claim that union workers are 22% more productive is bogus. Consider the inability of the once great American Automobile Industry which was, arguably, unable to compete due to excessive demands by the UAW . Having spent 30 years in the Automobile supplier industry, I saw this happen first hand.

Clearly, this bill is nothing but pay-back to the union bosses for their spending of union dues in support of the Democrat party and you should be ashamed of bowing to their extortion. Your position is wrong and your arguments are nothing but union propaganda.

Sadly,

$B!! (J

"Hallelujah! Show us the money!"

Can the Paideia seminar be effective in an online 3D virtual world?   What do we lose, what do we gain when we take the Paideia seminar virtual? Join Terry Roberts aka Paideia Maven, Executive Director of the National Paideia Institute, in the Temple of Learning on USDLC's beautiful Star Island in Second Life for a critical inquiry and seminar. We'll try out some new communication tools designed for this purpose.

This special 60-minute webinar will look at whether signs of economic recovery are real or wishful thinking, and whether the credit picture has sufficiently thawed for the aviation sector to get access to the cash it needs to invest and grow. Aerospace companies in the defense industry also will learn important advice on how to obtain scarce funding.

As a registrant, you'll be able to ask questions of the true movers-and-shakers in the aviation sector. Learn directly from some of the world's leading financial wizards what tactics, technologies and strategies will help you as the world financial system emerges from the worst chaos it has seen since the dark days of the 1930s.

If you finance, buy, sell, lease, operate, own, insure, or make aircraft, you'll find this webinar of invaluable help. This interactive webinar will provide practical knowledge and guidance from the top thought leaders in aviation finance.

You'll learn:

* What techniques are hard-pressed aviation companies, particularly airlines, using to raise cash?

* What's the best way to forge a working relationship with private equity, venture capitalists, and hedge funds?

* What can you learn from the ways in which airlines have merged and financially restructured?

* How can distressed aviation companies enhance cash flow? What alternatives are available to them?

* What role does technology and software automation play in ensuring financial well-being?

* What real world tactics are aviation companies using to mitigate financial risk?

* What's the outlook in 2010 for airline consolidation?

Health insurance reform reaches critical milestone

The U.S. House of Representatives reached a critical milestone on Saturday when they passed the Affordable Health Care for America Act.

This legislation will finally rein in the insurance companies' worst practices while extending coverage to 36 million Americans and cutting the deficit by $104 billion in the next ten years. It was supported by a wide range of groups including: doctors, patients, seniors, consumers, and Americans across the country.

The bill is now in the U.S. Senate.  Thanks to their long hours and hard work, the Senate is poised to pass comprehensive health reform legislation by the end of the year.



Like the House bill, the Senate version would provide unprecedented security and stability for Americans with insurance; affordable options for those who don't currently have coverage; and bring down the cost of health care for families, businesses, and government while strengthening the financial health of Medicare. It is also fully paid for and will bring down the long-term federal deficit.



While the U.S. House vote represented a significant step forward, many more will be needed until we reach the goal of affordable, high quality health care for every American.



Insurance companies and their cronies in Congress like Richard Burr will fight us every step of the way. But we will never give up or give in. The 1.4 million uninsured North Carolinians are depending on us.





General Assembly Spotlight: Senate Majority Leader Tony Rand

Everyone has a story to tell about Senate Majority Leader Tony Rand.

Maybe it was the time he helped a cub political reporter understand the nuances of the state budget; his unwavering support for higher education; or the advice he gave to a legislator trying to shepherd a bill through the General Assembly.

It is the collection of these stories that form his legislative legacy. Rand announced last week his immediate retirement from the General Assembly to become chairman of the State Parole Commission.

Rand represented the state's 19th Senate District from his appointment in 1981 until 1988, when he unsuccessfully ran for lieutenant governor; and from 1995 to his recent resignation. His district includes Bladen and Cumberland counties.

A Fayetteville attorney and consultant, Rand served as Senate Majority Leader for the past eight years.  Rand was often consistently ranked as one of the most effective and powerful members of the General Assembly. His humor and sly southern drawl belied his deftness in outfoxing Republican maneuvering on the Senate floor.

After sponsoring hundreds of pieces of legislation over the years, Rand said he is proudest of the 1999 bond referendum that allowed voters to decide whether the state should borrow up to $3 billion for construction and repair projects at the state's public universities and community colleges. At the time, it was the largest higher education bond in the country.

"I don't know if I was more proud of the legislation or the people of North Carolina, but I thought it was really something that the majority of the people in every county in this state thought this was something we should do," Rand said. 

"I would hope we would continue our aggressive support of education," Rand continued. "I hope we would continue to make our government efficient more responsive and that people would feel like that government is a good steward of its resources."



Gov. Bev Perdue launches "Race to the Top" initiative

Gov. Bev Perdue recently launched <http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=uLKdy93oEh0iT4ISCPY61OyqwnXwddpS>racetothetop.nc.gov and called upon North Carolinians to participate in the federal "Race to the Top" initiative. 

As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, "Race to the Top" is a federal $4.5 billion competitive grant fund that rewards states for educational innovation and achieving significant improvements in how students perform.

In addition to providing information about North Carolina's Race to the Top efforts, the new website seeks ideas and suggestions from the public regarding new education innovations and reforms.

"North Carolina is already a national leader in educational innovation," said Perdue.  "We are turning around low-performing schools, working to lower the dropout rate, and creating a network for virtual school learning opportunities so all students are career ready.  I'm confident that our state is in a good position to receive Race to the Top funding."

As part of the grant requirements, each state must submit an application from the Governor and signed by the Chairman of State Board of Education and the Chief State School Officer. The application must assess the state's current education reform efforts and build on those by presenting a comprehensive plan for improving student outcomes in four areas:

• Internationally-benchmarked standards and assessments.
• Development of data systems that measure success and improve instruction.
• Supporting effective teachers and leaders.
• Turning around low-performing schools.

North Carolina is already working on higher standards, better curriculum, developing teachers, and improving low performing schools.  In addition, the state is creating new and meaningful assessments, including putting in place a Pre-K to 20 data information system to help keep students on grade level, and to ensure graduates are career ready and prepared for higher education.

The U.S. Department of Education will award the first Race to the Top grants in early 2010. 



Supporting the troops throughout the year

This week Americans honored our veterans, military personnel, and their families for the courage and the sacrifices they have made to protect our freedoms and promote democracy across the globe.

from Flanders fields to the mountains of Afghanistan and everywhere in between our servicemen and women have selflessly, bravely, and honorably served our nation and allowed each of us to live in comfort and peace. The debt we owe them for this can never be fully repaid, and that is why it is so important for every American to take the time to say 'thank you.'

The North Carolina Democratic Party encourages each of you to visit <http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=KexgqdDt51cYsHUb77wwvOyqwnXwddpS>www.USO.org and make a contribution to one of their many worthwhile programs like <http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=IxoxcV%2F5%2B3GoizGfKCxWg%2ByqwnXwddpS>Operation Phone Home, which provides free International calling cards to service members overseas; <http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=7Y8cXyKfuFvLQqz34Q%2BctOyqwnXwddpS>United Through Reading, which allows those serving overseas to record a DVD of themselves reading a book aloud to their children at home; or <http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=otOTJiZdziDIwI%2FQMjwysuyqwnXwddpS>Operation Enduring Care, which helps meet the recovery needs of wounded military personnel and their families.

Right here at home the Wake County Democratic Party organized an effort to send care packages to North Carolina Reservists and National Guardsmen currently serving overseas. To date they have sent more than one hundred packages and still have another hundred ready to be sent. You can send one of the packages by sending a check for $14 made payable to "Custom Postal" to the Wake County Democratic Party at 220 Hillsborough St., Raleigh NC 27603.

For more information, contact the Wake County Democrats at (919) 828-5656 or <mailto:admin@wakedems.org>admin@wakedems.org.

You can also send an email to say thank you to those serving by visiting the Defense Department's website, <http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=o4CJIADjqW2CpaawpIsIDOyqwnXwddpS>HERE.

As the holiday season nears, citizens, businesses, and other civic organizations can make donations to the residents at the state veterans' nursing homes in Fayetteville and Salisbury. Please call (919) 733-3851 to find out how you can help.

An estimated 30 percent of the homeless in America have served in the Armed Forces. Get together with family, friends, and neighbors and volunteer at a local VA Stand Down event. Click <http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=F4LoiwH9iQoV%2F13ge8NEu%2ByqwnXwddpS>HERE for more information.

And finally, please remember to just say "Thank you. We appreciate what you're doing for us, and we're proud of you," any time you see a service member in uniform on the street, in the airport.

THE PENALTY OF DEATH IS LEGAL, I APROVED FOR SEXUAL VIOLATOR AND PEOPLE THAT MAKE ABUSE OF CHILDRENS AND YOUNG PEOPLE.
THE TAX IS FOR THE PROSPERITY OF THE CITIES: 10%  OF TAX IS THE LEGAL, AND OBLIGATE.
THE INTEREST OVER CREDIT IS: 40 % OVER THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT, THEN DIVIDE THE TOTAL WITH THE INTEREST IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE MONTH TO PAY THE CREDIT, AND THAT IS GOING TO BE THE MENSUAL FIXED CUOTE THAT THE PEOPLE IS GOING TO PAY, UNTIL THEY PAY ALL THE LOAN.
FOR EXAMPLE: 5 YEARS, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONTH ARE 60 MONTHS. 20 YEARS: THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONTHS IS 240 MONTHS.
FOR EXAMPLE A HOUSE OF $50,000.00, MORE THE INTEREST (25%)= 50,000.00 + 12,500 = 62,500. THE TOTAL IS 62,500.00, BETWEEN 240 MONTH (20YEARS) = 260.41 PER MONTH.
SO, THE PEOPLE IS GOING TO PAY 260.41 EVERY MONTH UNTIL THE FINISH THE PAY ALL.
I AM NOT AGREE WITH THE 40% OF INTEREST, MUST BE THE 25% OF INTEREST OVER THE TOTAL AMOUNT TO THE LOAN OR CREDIT. THEN DIVIDE THAT BETWEEN THE QUANTITY OF MONTH TO PAY, AND THA IS GOING TO BE THE MENSUALITY.
I DO NOT WANT MORE FRAUDE, AND THAT YOU CONTINUE MAKING RICH YOURSELF OF THE NECESITY OF OTHERS, THE INTEREST OVER ALL THE LOANS IS GOING TO BE 25% OVER THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN OR CREDITS. NOT MORE, AND DO NOT CONTINUE CHARGING THE WAY THAT YOU ARE DOING IS A FRAUD.
EL PAGO DE INTERES SERA: 25% SOBRE EL MONTO TOTAL DEL CREDITO, I ESTE TOTAL SE DIVIDIRA ENTRE LOS MESES A PAGAR, I ESA SERA LA CUOTA MENSUAL FIJA A PAGAR, HASTA QUE TERMINEN DE PAGAR. NO APRUEBO EL 40% DE INTERES, ES UN ROBO DE LA NECESIDAD DE LOS DEMAS, NO CONTINUEN CON EL FRAUDE. NO SIGAN COBRANDO ASI LOS INTERESES, NO JUEGEN O SE APROVECHEN DE LA NECESIDAD DE OS DEMAS, NO SE HAGAN RICOS A COSTA DEL DURO TRABAJO DE LOAS DEMAS.
EL PAGO DE IMPUESTOS ES DEL 10%.
EL PAGO DEL OS INTERESES SOBRE LOS CREDITOS O PRESTAMOS ES DEL 25%, SOBRE EL TOTAL A PAGAR. I SE DIVIDE ENTRE LOS MESES A PAGAR, I YA ESTA, NO SIGAN ROBANDO I HACIENDO FRAUDE.
NOT MORE FRAUD AND CREDITICIAL ROBERY. STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

BRAC Regional Task Force
Announcement




The BRAC Regional Task Force Executive Committee will not meet on Thursday, November 19, at Spring Lake Family Resource Center.  In lieu of a public meeting, the executive committee will meet instead via a webinar. 

The webinar option for the executive committee was discussed at the October board of directors meeting.  It is an effort that will help us work more efficiently and reduce travel costs and time for our committee members. 

The BRAC RTF bylaws do not require the executive committee to meet in a public forum. Voting on any action items will continue to take place at the quarterly board meetings which are open to the public.  The next board meeting is scheduled at 10 a.m. on January 28, 2010, at the Spring Lake Family Resource Center.

Subject: [Aid4Mail Trial tag #5555] CRNA supervision requirement

Gov. Purdue:

Currently I am a graduate student researching why certain states
decided to require CRNA supervision and medical direction in their
practice and others did not.  Thus,
I am writing to inquire about your decision to continue to opt in
regarding the CRNA
supervision requirement (42
CFR Part 416, 482, and 485 Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Hospital
Conditions of Participation: Anesthesia Services).  Could you clarify
for me the rationale you had for the decision?  Specifically, who did
you consult in your decision, what
research, cost analysis, etc swayed your opinion?

Thanks,
Leah Dickerson, RN, BSN, CCRN

”The trouble with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.” - Margaret Thatcher  (“Wants” become “Needs” then “Rights” & exceed any tax-ability to pay for them.)

"You cannot legislate the poor into freedom by legislating the wealthy out of freedom. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving. The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.

“When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that my dear friend, is about the end of any nation. You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it."  -- Dr. Adrian Rogers (1931-2005)

>>> This has to be the forward of the year!  Please take a few minutes to read and absorb just what this woman had say, and then hopefully everyone will pass it to their entire mailing list, and theirs to theirs until it circles the nation!  Time is short and arrogance, stupidity and ignorance abounds ......................

>>> 	
>>> The following letter, read on Glenn Beck's show, is rapidly circulating around the country. Americans everywhere identify with this 53-year-old woman. She has given us a voice. Once you read this, you will want to forward it to all of your friends...

>>> 	
>>> GLENN BECK: I got a letter from a woman in Arizona . She writes an open letter to our nation's leadership:
>>> 
>>> 
>>> "I'm a home grown American citizen, 53, registered Democrat all my life. Before the last presidential election I registered as a Republican because I no longer felt the Democratic Party represents my views or works to pursue issues important to me. Now I no longer feel the Republican Party represents my views or works to pursue issues important to me. The fact is I no longer feel any political party or representative in Washington represents my views or works to pursue the issues important to me. There must be someone. Please tell me who you are.. Please stand up and tell me that you are there and that you're willing to fight for our Constitution as it was written. Please stand up now. You might ask yourself what my views and issues are that I would horribly feel so disenfranchised by both major political parties. What kind of nut job am I? Will you please tell me?
>>> Well, these are briefly my views and issues for which I seek representation:
>>> 
>>> 
>>> One, illegal immigration.. I want you to stop coddling illegal immigrants and secure our borders. Close the underground tunnels. Stop the violence and the trafficking in drugs and people. No amnesty, not again. Been there, done that, no resolution. P.S., I'm not a racist. This isn't to be confused with legal immigration.
>>> 
>>> 
>>> Two, the STIMULUS bill, I want it repealed and I want no further funding supplied to it. We told you no, but you did it anyway. I want the remaining unfunded 95% repealed. Freeze, repeal.
>>> 
>>> 
>>> Three: Czars, I want the circumvention of our checks and balances stopped immediately. Fire the czars. No more czars. Government officials answer to the process, not to the president. Stop trampling on our Constitution and honor it.
>>> 
>>> 
>>> Four, cap and trade. The debate on global warming is not over. There is more to say.
>>> 
>>> 
>>> Five, universal healthcare. I will not be rushed into another expensive decision. Don't you dare try to pass this in the middle of the night and then go on break. Slow down!
>>> 
>>> 
>>> Six, growing government control. I want states rights and sovereignty fully restored. I want less government in my life, not more. Shrink it down. Mind your own business. You have enough to take care of with your real obligations. Why don't you start there.
>>> 
>>> 
>>> Seven, ACORN. I do not want ACORN and its affiliates in charge of our 2010 census. I want them investigated. I also do not want mandatory escrow fees contributed to them every time on every real estate deal that closes. Stop the funding to ACORN and its affiliates pending impartial audits and investigations. I do not trust them with taking the census over with our taxpayer money. I don't trust them with our taxpayer money. Face up to the allegations against them and get it resolved before taxpayers get any more involved with them. If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, hello. Stop protecting your political buddies. You work for us, the people. Investigate.
>>> 
>>> 
>>> Eight, redistribution of wealth. No, no, no. I work for my money. It is mine. I have always worked for people with more money than I have because they gave me jobs. That is the only redistribution of wealth that I will support. I never got a job from a poor person. Why do you want me to hate my employers? Why -- what do you have against shareholders making a profit?
>>> 
>>> 
>>> Nine, charitable contributions.. Although I never got a job from a poor person, I have helped many in need. Charity belongs in our local communities, where we know our needs best and can use our local talent and our local resources. Butt out, please. We want to do it ourselves.
>>> 
>>> 
>>> Ten, corporate bailouts. Knock it off. Sink or swim like the rest of us. If there are hard times ahead, we'll be better off just getting into it and letting the strong survive. Quick and painful. Have you ever ripped off a Band-Aid? We will pull together. Great things happen in America under great hardship. Give us the chance to innovate. We cannot disappoint you more than you have disappointed us.
>>> 
>>> 
>>> Eleven, transparency and accountability. How about it? No, really, how about it? Let's have it. Let's say we give the buzzwords a rest and have some straight honest talk. Please try -- please stop manipulating and trying to appease me with clever wording. I am not the idiot you obviously take me for. Stop sneaking around and meeting in back rooms making deals with your friends. It will only be a prelude to your criminal investigation. Stop hiding things from me..
>>> 
>>> 
>>> Twelve, unprecedented quick spending. Stop it now.
>>> Take a breath. Listen to the people. Let's just slow down and get some input from some nonpoliticians on the subject. Stop making everything an emergency. Stop speed reading our bills into law. I am not an activist. I am not a community organizer. Nor am I a terrorist, a militant or a violent person. I am a parent and a grandparent. I work. I'm busy. I'm busy. I am busy, and I am tired. I thought we elected competent people to take care of the business of government so that we could work, raise our families, pay our bills, have a little recreation, complain about taxes, endure our hardships, pursue our personal goals, cut our lawn, wash our cars on the weekends and be responsible contributing members of society and teach our children to be the same all while living in the home of the free and land of the brave.
>>> 
>>> 
>>> I entrusted you with upholding the Constitution. I believed in the checks and balances to keep from getting far off course. What happened? You are very far off course. Do you really think I find humor in the hiring of a speed reader to unintelligently ramble all through a bill that you signed into law without knowing what it contained? I do not. It is a mockery of the responsibility I have entrusted to you. It is a slap in the face. I am not laughing at your arrogance. Why is it that I feel as if you would not trust me to make a single decision about my own life and how I would live it but you should expect that I should trust you with the debt that you have laid on all of us and our children. We did not want the TARP bill.. We said no. We would repeal it if we could. I am sure that we still cannot. There is such urgency and recklessness in all of the recent spending.
>>> 
>>> 
>>> From my perspective, it seems that all of you have gone insane. I also know that I am far from alone in these feelings. Do you honestly feel that your current pursuits have merit to patriotic Americans? We want it to stop. We want to put the brakes on everything that is being rushed by us and forced upon us. We want our voice back. You have forced us to put our lives on hold to straighten out the mess that you are making. We will have to give up our vacations, our time spent with our children, any relaxation time we may have had and money we cannot afford to spend on you to bring our concerns to Washington . Our president often knows all the right buzzword is unsustainable. Well, no kidding.. How many tens of thousands of dollars did the focus group cost to come up with that word? We don't want your overpriced words Stop treating us like we're morons.
>>> 
>>> 
>>> We want all of you to stop focusing on your reelection and do the job we want done, not the job you want done or the job your party wants done. You work for us and at this rate I guarantee you not for long because we are coming. We will be heard and we will be represented. You think we're so busy with our lives that we will never come for you? We are the formerly silent majority, all of us who quietly work , pay taxes, obey the law, vote, save money, keep our noses to the grindstone and we are now looking up at you. You have awakened us, the patriotic freedom spirit so strong and so powerful that it had been sleeping too long.. You have pushed us too far. Our numbers are great. They may surprise you. For every one of us who will be there, there will be hundreds more that could not come. Unlike you, we have their trust. We will represent them honestly, rest assured. They will be at the polls on voting day to usher you out of office. We have cancelled vacations. We will use our last few dollars saved. We will find the representation among us and a grassroots campaign will flourish. We didn't ask for this fight. But the gloves are coming off. We do not come in violence, but we are angry. You will represent us or you will be replaced with someone who will. There are candidates among us when he will rise like a Phoenix from the ashes that you have made of our constitution.
>>> 
>>> 
>>> Democrat, Republican, independent, libertarian. Understand this. We don't care. Political parties are meaningless to us Patriotic Americans are willing to do right by us and our Constitution and that is all that matters to us now. We are going to fire all of you who abuse power and seek more. It is not your power. It is ours and we want it back. We entrusted you with it and you abused it. You are dishonorable. You are dishonest. As Americans we are ashamed of you. You have brought shame to us. If you are not representing the wants and needs of your constituency loudly and consistently, in spite of the objections of your party, you will be fired. Did you hear? We no longer care about your political parties. You need to be loyal to us, not to them. Because we will get you fired and they will not save you. If you do or can represent me, my issues, my views, please stand up. Make your identity known. You need to make some noise about it. Speak up. I need to know who you are. If you do not speak up, you will be herded out with the rest of the sheep and we will replace the whole damn congress if need be one by one. We are coming. Are we coming for you? Who do you represent? What do you represent? Listen. Because we are coming. We the people are coming."

Dear David Young,

First Speaker Black and now Mike Easley!

I've been voting Democratic for a long, long time but unless the Party 
cleans up its act, it will not be able to depend upon my vote or support 
in the future.

My impression is that Governor Perdue is trying to turn over a new leaf 
-- more power to her!

I am delighted that Tony Rand is retiring from his position as the Blue 
Cross/Blue Shield representative to the legislature -- let's make sure 
that no one else steps into that spot!

I know that corruption is non-partisan and that sleaze can be found 
under many legislative rocks. I call upon you to set a high standard for 
Democratic elected officials and candidates, and then to hold them to it.

Yours,

Paul Brinich
