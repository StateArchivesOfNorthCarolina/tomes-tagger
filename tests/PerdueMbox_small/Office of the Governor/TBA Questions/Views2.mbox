Subject: Priorities as NC's Governor

Comment: I have serious concerns regarding an article in the News and Observer about your plans to redecorate the Governor's Mansion at this point in time. I'm a woman so it's not that I don't understand about decor. I'm all for you going all out to redecorate, if you're using your money. On the other hand, if it involves using taxpayers' money, then I can't believe you could even consider with a clear conscience making changes just because the decor doesn't suit your taste. There are so many hard-working Americans that are barely getting by, now not knowing if they'll even have a job the next day. The government has cut spending on our children's educations - our country's future leaders, and also cutting spending on our elderly population - What kind of message is that sending? I guess my point in all of this is please reconsider what is really important - you are living in a mansion, you're the governor - you can either set an example for other politicians and the people of North Carolina to see. It's a choice - will you choose to stand out and make a difference, or fall in with the crowd and play the "game" of politics? This isn't a letter written in anger, but in concern for our state and for our country's future. Every little bit can make a difference. Thank you for your time and consideration. Anissa White

Subject: NC fiscal policy

Comment: Have you pondered the implications of the federal government running large deficits while 50 state governments cut spending to try to balance their own budgets? While I realize that both law and market forces (not to mention political pressures) constrain the size of state government deficits, the same logic that impels increasing rather than decreasing federal spending also applies to state governments, especially when viewed in the aggregate. To the extent that a given state government program has the character of an investment rather than of consumption, it is very short-sighted to make large reductions in such programs.

Governor Bev Perdue
20301 Mail Service Center
Raleigh, NC 27699-0301

Dear Governor Perdue,

The most effective way to make our world a greener place is to
teach the value of green living to our children, so that they
may continue the sustainability efforts that we have only just
begun.

Bound by endless regulations, traditional public schools are
restricted to basic curriculum. But alternative schools, like
public charter schools, have the unique ability to integrate
green-minded curriculum into the classroom.

In some cases, green scenery becomes the classroom. Green public
charter schools have integrated life-lessons for healthy and
green living through classes that focus on organic flower and
vegetable gardens, urban planning, public health and
environmental justice.

Basic education courses can be taught through the eyes of the
environment, like learning math through measuring trees and
leaves, and learning relative differences by discovering that
elms are taller than box elders.

Public charter schools are also answering the call of the U.N.
Decade for Education for Sustainable Development to rethink
education to address the problems of the 21st century.
Alternative schools support students in developing a
sophisticated, multifaceted understanding of the world they live
in, making them future competitors in the global job market.

Please support green public charter schools in making our future
brighter and more sustainable.


Sincerely,
Dorothy Cook

Subject: Appointment of Dr. William Harrison

Comment: Governor Perdue: I was highly disappointed to hear of your appointment of Dr. William Harrison as head of the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. As head of the Cumberland County School School System, he has failed the county and the students. There has not been any statistically significant improvement in the county's State test scores in recent years especially EOC's. There are also problems with teacher turnover in his county, school maintenance issues, and budget issues. I might ask what significant contributions have you observed that he has made in his local school system to merit such a position that you have given him? Moreover, Dr. Harrison's recent incident with Fayetteville City Councilman Charles Evan's and his even more recent request for raises and increased health and retirement benefits for his staff show how out of touch he is with economic conditions and how poorly he can work with public officials. While Dr. Harrison eventually apologized after news appeared in papers and television for his disparaging remarks about the councilman, he did not apologize to the students whose education he is supposed to be overseeing for setting a very poor example of leadership. How can a leader ask for more money for his staff when the budget he oversees can't fulfill the needs of students? What about pay for the teachers who are actually doing the educating? Does he feel that they are well compensated, or that their health benefits are above average or superior to those of his staff? Is he afraid that his staff will leave for hire paying better benefit positions elsewhere? Teachers could do the same. Appointing Dr. Harrison to this position is a perfect example of ‚Äù The Peter Principle‚Äù - Squared. Dr. Harrison was already promoted to his highest level of incompetence as a school system superintendent. Name for me just three outstanding achievements of Dr. Harrison in the last five years as Superintendent of Cumberland County Schools. I believe that if you had looked hard enough, one of the 100 plus school systems in the state surely would have someone more competent. Outside of the school system there are numerous business leaders or retired business leaders that could have provided the leadership that DPI needs. Sincerely, Roby Mulier

Comment: Good afternoon Governor Perdue, I am sending this email to thank you for your strong deportment on education. I feel uniquely tied to this commitment to academic achievement for all students. I am first and foremost a parent to Tylon Jones, a 3rd grader at E.Melvin Honeycutt School in Cumberland County; it is imperative that my son is ready to compete locally, and perhaps more important, globally. I am also a NC Literacy Coach serving Spring Lake Middle School. Dr. Harrison‚Äôs vision for a comprehensive literacy program to increase academic achievement afforded me the opportunity to serve in my capacity. Perhaps most interesting, I am a product of New Bern, NC! ( A little place known as Brices Creek) I know what it is like to have strong, intelligent, and caring teachers. My academic foundation in the schools of New Bern led me to my career choice. Once again, thank you for your dedication to the young people of NC and might I extend heartfelt congratulations on your new gubernatorial position. Always youth first, Mrs. Clare-Jones

Comment: As a life long Democrat and small contributor to your campaign for Governor, I must say that I am extremely disappointed in your decision to reorganize the State Department of Education. Supt. Atkinson is a well-qualified person who could have led this department, had she been allowed. I'm sure Dr. Harrison is also a well-qualified individual, but the people of North Carolina RE-ELECTED Supt. Atkinson. Until the legislature officially changes the position, the voice of the people of this State should be heard and the elected Superintendent allowed to lead. Thank you.

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Ms. Perdue,

gov. bev perdue has asked her staff to find ways to balance the nc budget, and, on the table is cutting hiv prevention/adap and hiv case management services. this has devestating implications for our state.
The above has been brought to my attention and I will fight this to the end! You are playing with life and death and this is outrageous! Cutting the budget is far from what needs to happen in fact if you would take time to make yourself aware of the increase of people contracting this virus you would increase the budget not cut it! I have pasted my story in hope this will open you eyes and lessen your prejudicial attitude. This virus can be spread to anyone there are no specific categories. There is however facts showing the virus is rapidly increasing in African American and Latino women.

This virus can be a death sentence and most definitely shortens the length of a person's life and the quality. You have no right to play God and cut off the help that is so deserving of all infected. Find another area where the budget can be cut and don't cut lives!!! I am Charlottean and come from extremely good family. This virus could happen to you, your children, grand children, brother, sister, aunt, uncle anyone. The decision you are considering is one you have no right to and should be left up to professionals such as doctors and persons knowing the complications of HIV/AIDS.







MY STORY by PATRICIA GARDNER



MY STORY by Patricia Gardner On December 26th, 2003, I was diagnosed with AIDS. This was only eleven days after my father passed away. I went to ER with double vision, they admitted me and after many tests they diagnosed me with AIDS and MS. My oldest brother shunned me and actually threw me out of his house at Christmas. I was eating "party mix" from the same bowl as my nieces (his daughters). He doesn't call or visit any longer. One of my cousins invited me to come visit anytime until she found out that I have AIDS. She has withdrawn the invitation and no longer contacts me. I met a girl that living in the same apartments, as myself, and she called 3 to 4 times a day. We went everywhere together, becoming great friends and spent every weekend at the pool together. Once I told her that I have AIDS she no longer calls ceased and she spends no time with me any longer†

The stigma surrounds my life daily.



I struggle through life just as everyone does each day and I have no tolerance for the stigma. I have also found that people don't want to be educated on this disease. People who have HIV/AIDS do suffer everyday and they don't need to suffer from the batter and degradation. I have been a very fortunate and have benefited from my disease. I am very blessed and I now have an advocacy that God gave me called The Red Hive (Real, Effective, Determination for HIVEducation). We are a branch of RAIN and are extremely fortunate to have their support. All of my advocates are infected and help persons infected with HIV/AIDS.



I have grown and learned so much about myself and life through this disease it's so amazing! So many others aren't as fortunate, however. They are suffering deeply from the disease and the stigma. I would also like to add that I am a white 46 year old heterosexual female. I have an Associates Degree in Business. I graduated from Myers Park High School. I grew up in Charlotte in the Southpark area. I was a model for Belk and other local stores and represented the Belk Teenboard for my school in 1977. I†wonder what these prejudice persons must be thinking. Do you suppose they know someone like me becomes infected? Like I said previously, the stigma must end and acceptance must begin. Everyone needs to be educated on HIV/AIDS. This is the only way to protect themselves and others that they love. Thank you for caring and together we can make a difference.



I would also like to add the medications lessen the quality of life they cause a great deal of side effects, such as chemotherapy does. The nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are just a few. To live the medication is extremely imperative and one must continue to try to live in a manner as if they are not ill. It's difficult but does become a part of acceptance with the virus. I am committed to control this virus it will not kill me or mar my body any further. I am dedicated to helping others and myself, this will never end!


In the past few years my brother has gotten much closer and we are mending our relationship, however, I still feel a distance with him.

I'm not interested in empathy or pity, I don't care for any of this. I am interested in making you aware of the complications. Realize also we live on monies below poverty level and can no longer work. Any cold, flu, or virus I'm subjected to I catch from others and one of the most important things is I will never be able to own my own home again. How would you handle this if it were you and could you handle it? I do wonder!!!



Truly,

Patricia Gardner







I do hope this story which if factual will help you understand how important it is to continue to increase monies for all considerations concerning HIV/AIDS medical help and education!

Forthermore,I would like to know if as the governor of  the people of North Carolinam, will you raise your voice against big comporations. Let say the insurance for example, they like to charge you a high primium, however  when you need them, 96.5% they will say  you do not qualify. Please look at this. I almost break off my left shoulder at work whaile doing my job.  But my insurance said that I did not qualify to recieve work compersation. As my gobernor, can you help me out to fix the insurance system? There can be hope, justice, and freedom if there are not right for all.

Hope should bring jusstice; justice must bring freedon,and these are present only when there are right for all.

Comment: After watching the news I became aware of the proposed increase to insurance for smokers and obese individuals. "Did you run your 4 miles?" How completely clueless are you, by some guidelines I would just about bet that you yourself BEV Perdue would be considered over weight. Have you lost your mind? Do you really think that insurance companies NEED MORE MONEY?? I am a mother of 2 children, I have been battling the bulge since their birth and I currently can't get health insurance because of my weight. Can you not see past the nose on your face? Surly you can see that this is an attempt by the insurance companies to get more money?!!!! God I am so mad and to think I actually voted for you!

Comment: I agree that smokers and even abusers of alcohol should pay a higher price for health care. However, the issue of obesity is a sensitive area. How the standards for obesity are set, etc could become very contoversal. Some people are obese because of desease, illness or handicap. I saw the Gov on TV last night and her comments were sarcastic, degrading and uncalled for when she said: "at 5:30 this morning I did four miles, what were you doing then." Some retired employees are disabled and can't do "four miles" she owes those people an apology.

Subject: Mileage tax

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue, I live in rural Stokes County because I am poor and cannot afford housing in Winston Salem. Everyone in my neighborhood lives in trailers and commutes to work. If you impose a mileage tax on us, it will in essense punish us for not being able to live in the city because of our economic situation. You will succeed in making us even less prosperous. As an American, I also strongly object to anyone tracking my movements. I am a law abiding citizen. But I understand that if, for instance, the government decides my religion is invalid, and I continue to worship, like what is happening right now in China and other countries every day, having a tracking device on me will be convenient. Does this sound paranoid? Maybe. Do I want to ever lose the ability to be completely free in America? A little freedom is being stolen away every year by our government agencies. My husband is Cuban. He lived through the loss of freedom in his country, and he was arrested and incarcerated by Castro. Did he ever expect that to happen in his country? No, the Cuban people were taken by surprise. They supported Castro on an "Anyone but Batista" platform, and they have been suffering ever since. We are definitely getting change in America. Scary change. Please do not contribute to taking away my freedom.

Subject: concern over mileage tax

Comment: Hello! I am VERY concerned over the rumors I have been hearing about taxing motorists on mileage. I deliver newspapers as my family's sole income as I have an elderly father to care for. If a measure like this was passed, it would place my family and the families of many people that need their vehicles for work in serious distress,not to mention even more unemployment since so many of us would have to quit our jobs because we could not afford the tax.I can understand placing toll booths on heavily traveled roads or even increasing the price of tag renewal. However, so many of the carriers I know simply cannot afford such a devastating blow. We do not make a large income and as newspaper carriers, we are ineligible for unemployment if something was to happen to our jobs. Such a tax would destroy our income completely.In addition to the newspaper carriers, I also think of the impact it would have on mail carriers. With rumors of mail going to five day delivery I would imagine this will decrease their income as well.If they were forced to pay additional money to deliver mail I feel they would also have to seek different employment. Sadly,in this day and time, that is much easier said than done. In closing, I would like to say that I am pleased to have you as our governor and pray that you will not consider such a drastic measure.The delivery people of North Carolina can't afford to see this happen. Thank you for your time and may God Bless You!!

Subject: TAXES

Comment: Gov. Purdue, I have one request to make of your office. Keep your hands off my money. The US government is doing a good job right now of making sure that we have less and less each day. I sure hope you don't intend to follow suit with any new tax and spend policies. And as for this proposed Mileage Tax. Stop it right there. I will pay my tax at the gas pump, but you keep your nose out of my personal driving habits. I will not stand for an Orwellian society. That is an intrusion into my personal life. I drive to and from work, for work, to church, friends, family and pleasure. I will not be made to feel that I am being spied on. Next thing you know, someone will want to put a tracking chip in my vehicle, and track me like some criminal. NO THANKS. If this state needs money for road repairs, put a toll on that road. Other states do it and no one complains. You either drive it or you don't. Pure and simple. Why doesn't someone up there in Raleigh "WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE" Lori Blais

Subject: Opposed to Mileage Tax

Comment: I am very opposed to the mileage tax. I was laid off in December and just started a new job last week. I had to take a pay cut of one third of my previous salary in my new position. My husband and I are already overtaxed. The only places that I typically drive are to work and to my mother's house. My mother is 70 and I am providing her with care and support. I drive 68 miles roundtrip to take her to the doctor, mow her yard, and help her around the house. This new tax would pose a great hardship. Sincerely, Sheila Johnson

Comment: Dear Govenor Purdue, I am writing to request that in these hard times you not cut the epilepsy foundation funding. I am a single woman who is responsible for my sister who depends upon the foundation for her medicine. We have and are going through the disability process, however, that is a lengthy process that she keeps getting turned down. I personally take care of her other needs and it is a tremendous strain upon myself, but....she is my sister and It's just us so I have no other choice. Please don't cut this program I can not afford her epliepsy medication. I pay for her other meds as it is. Those medications are quite expensive. and I can't tell you how much they help us. Agian PLEASE do not cut this program. thank-you Kellie Albus po box 424 morehead city nc 28557 252-725-8607 Kalbus@email.unc.edu

Subject: State Health care Increases

Comment: I like the proposal that smokers and drinkers pay higher premiums. I would like to suggest that we spread the cost of the premiums based on salary/risks/usage. Myself, I make under 30,000 base salary and the 414.00 plus dollars I pay per month for the family plan is too much. Employees making 100,000 a year pay the same premium as employees making 30,000 or less. Employess making more should pay more for their benefits. This would eliminate funding shortages and fairly spread the cost of plan across board to all employees. Thanks, Robert L. Houck RobHouck57@aol.com

Subject: Medical Marijuana and LEGALIZE HEMP

Comment: Senator Hagan, Though your stance on keeping drugs away from children is noble and just, your stance on Medical Marijuana is fully without merit when you put this application of the drug in the same league as street drugs. Any drug over the counter or prescribed is a likely source for our youth to abuse, so get off of the soapbox. Further, if marijuana were legalized and controlled the same as alcohol, many more kids would NOT care for it because it is easy to get. I grew up with this culture and have seen that most kids try it because it means they know someone "cool" and they are acceptable to the "cool crowd." It's all status with young teens and you know that. So please show some real rationale and temper your argument with insight and understanding. And PLEASE LEGALIZE HEMP! HEMP IS NOT MARIJUANA, MAKES GREAT PAPER AND TEXTILES AND IS A GREAT MONEY CROP FOR NC FARMERS. Thank-you for your time. Sincerely, John Wyatt

Comment: I am fully against taxing our autos based on miles driven. Gas is way too high in NC, so that people do not drive any more than they have to now; and now, you want them to quit traveling or driving anywhere? How can you tax them on how many miles they drive? People, some, have very long commutes just to get to work. And vacation? Never, if this is how you will be taxed. This will hurt the economy even more. Please do not tax based on miles driven. That will definitely stop people from driving anywhere they do not need to and will penalize folks who have a long commute or just want to vacation. Thank you.

Subject: CFCC: sea training

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue: It is with great urgency that I write this correspondence to you in regard to the Marine Technical program of Cape Fear Community College. The local media recently highlighted the plan to eliminate a key feature of this program, the sea training- which is essential for the students enrolled in the program and a key reason that this program has been successful in the past. I am proud to say that my sister, who also notified me of this plight, is a graduate of this program and was competitively recruited to work in the field due to her training at CFCC. She has been working for Great Lakes Dock and Dredge for nearly 3 years and credits her training in this program for her ability not only to secure the position, but to succeed (evidenced by her promotions and bonuses). Let me point out that she earned a BS from UNCW in marine biology, prior to attending CFCC, that did not provide her with a competitive edge such as that earned by completing the Marine Technology program at CFCC. Based on the current economy, it would be prudent to invest in this program to assist training students with the skills for jobs that have not been affected, such as those ‚Äúoff shore.‚Äù With the arrival of stimulus funds to our state in the next few weeks, I would urge you to support investing a portion of the funds into education projects that are proven and successful. Lend your voice to saving the sea training at CFCC. Sincerely, Barbara P. Heath, Ph.D. East Main Educational Consulting, LLC Wilmington, NC www.emeconline.com

Comment: Dear Governor Bev Perdue, As a licensed real estate broker in the Wilmington, NC area for over 6 years now, I know that homeowners insurance rates play a major part in a persons ability to purchase a home. With the housing market here in our area at the lowest that it has been in many years, higher insurance rates would only continue to destroy real estate market. I know and understand the importance of having insurance but personally see no reason for the rates being increased at such an extent. As a strong supporter of you and your campaign I ask you to support the Stay on insurance rates. Thanks, William Anderson

Subject: NC Sovereignty

Comment: Ms. Perdue, I wrote you last week, and wanted to drop another note to you. There are now 22 states with resolutions either passed or in process to declare sovereignty from the federal US government as granted under the 10th amendment. I encourage you to follow the lead of these 22 states, including our neighbors SC and TN, and initiate the process to stand up for North Carolinians and protect us from what appears to be an oppressive US Government who is overreaching as they try to force their socialist policies and idealogies. To date, the states that are already sovereign, having passed 10th Amendment resolutions in their legislatures, include: California (CA) Texas (TX) States claiming sovereignty include: Arizona (AZ) Georgia (GA) Michigan (MI) Missouri (MO) Montana (MT) New Hampshire (NH) Oklahoma (OK) South Carolina (SC) Washington (WA) Hawaii (HI) is actually aiming for total sovereignty, as it claims the state was never really a state of the U.S.A. States that are planning motions toward claiming sovereignty include the following: Alabama (AL), Alaska (AK), Arkansas (AR), Colorado (CO, Idaho (ID), Indiana (IN), Kansas (KS), Maine (ME), Nevada (NV), Pennsylvania (PA), and Tennessee (TN). Please follow the leads of these states and protect the citizens of NC from an oppressive and socialist federal government. Ron Blackwelder 704-562-2968

Please consider endorsing H.R. 22. I want to make it clear that I fully support funding future retiree health benefits--employees are depending on those benefits when they retire. But given the current economic environment, prefunding on such an accelerated schedule is no longer feasible. H.R. 22 preserves the Postal Service's obligation to prefund and protects our health benefits while helping to sustain the Postal Service through a very troubling time for our nation. Please support it!

Governor Perdue,
I highly request that you do not allow or vote for the rate increase on our properties in Wilmington N.C. I am a small business owner and own several homes that we rent out. Adding to our already increased taxes, water, cost of living and all other things that our politicans feel that we should pay for, has allowed less moneies in our business to help to repair these homes.
Thank you,
Rhonda Ponos†

Subject: thank you 485

Comment: Gov Perdue, thank you so much for committing to the 485 loop project. We have lots of needs in Charlotte and this was one of them. Sidewalks would be better but this is a start. We feel like the red-headed step child on NC so this helps a lot!

Subject: School Teachers

Comment: Please try to find a way to cut spending other than our school teachers. Our children will be the ones to get short changed. We need to cut in DOT where it takes three people to watch one person plant a sign post or hold up a shovel. I know that you have many important decisions and I thank you for the effort you are putting forth. I wish you the best of luck in your job as our Governor. Sincerely, Louie Oakley

Subject: Energy

Comment: I watched the Governors meeting on Energy with TBoone Pickens and the CEO of Eflon. I was very impressed by their presentations. I was also disappointed that NC was not listed as being behind the Pickens Plan. We need Energy in this country and NOW. Please sign up and vote for this important issue.

Subject: problems

Comment: I hope you are not a clone to the prior govenor. Please get out and visit the hospitals (not just Cherry) everywhere unannounced. Please visit schools in our area unannouced to see what goes on everyday. The standards need to be raised and people need to be held accountable.
