Dear Governor,††
I as a business owner understand what you are going thru and it is not pretty.†† There† is a way to employee your people almost instantly and save billions on energy waste for the future.† I know this because we do it here everyday.† This is what you need to consider.† Please think about this, you can start a program for energy conservation by producing solar sun screen products for your state.† We will be happy to show you how and help you kick it off.† Solar sun screens are mounted on the exterior of windows of homes and blocks †80% -† 90%† of the suns heat by reflection and absorption thereby reducing 25-50% of the energy cost to cool and heat your homes in your state.† Now the good news is that it will employee tens of thousands of people to measure, make, install this product creating plenty of jobs. You do not need a collage degree to make this product. For example an unemployed school†teacher or banker could do this.† Please if i can help you and your people please give me a call @† Sunscape Shading Products llc.† My name is Bill sanders my phone†# is 928-681-2001††my cell 928-727-7559 †Thanks and i†hope for the best for the future of you and your people.

> State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession,†which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

> In that time, our stateís unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent ó 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolinaís families have been hurt by the recession, so has our stateís budget.

> The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolinaís history.

> Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolinaís government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

> This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our stateís mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

> Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

> Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolinaís long-term economic growth.

> Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

> As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

> We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect†core education, public safety and health care services,†or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

> Public education always†has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolinaís economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

> As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

> Iíve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect†public education.† Now I need your help.† The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.† But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our childrenís education.

> The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.

> †

Friends,

Happy Fourth of July!† Whether you are at a family cookout, watching a fireworks display, at the beach, the mountains or next to a pool, I hope this weekend can be a fun, relaxing and safe time with friends and family.† Enjoy the freedom that our Founding Fathers declared on this day so many years ago!

Increased Opportunity for Historically Underutilized Businesses

The Office for Historically Underutilized Businesses (HUB)†launched its new Statewide Uniform Certification (SWUC) program on Wednesday.† SWUC was developed to streamline the certification process, reduce the redundancy in certifying minority and women-owned businesses and create a centralized HUB and minority/women business database.† The HUB Office will take the lead in certifying HUB and Minority/Women Business Enterprise (M/WBE) firms that previously had to apply for certification both through the state HUB Office and local M/WBE program offices.

ìThis initiative will expand opportunities for minority-, disabled- and women-owned businesses to participate in state and local government contracts,î said Gov. Bev Perdue, who recently issued Executive Order No. 13 to assist HUB firms. ìWe trust it will help the state achieve, and hopefully exceed, its aspirational goal of at least 10 percent of all state government contracts being awarded to HUB firms.î

SWUC is the result of N.C. General Statute 143-128.4, 143-48.4.† It was developed by the HUB Office in collaboration with local M/WBE program directors and with feedback from HUB firms, prime contractors and HUB resource advocates.† In addition to increasing efficiency and service to the HUB community, SWUC will establish a centralized database for state agencies, local municipalities and contractors looking to identify and utilize HUB vendors and sub-contractors.

Buncombe County Manufacturer to Add 32 Jobs

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that Baldor Electric Co., an international supplier of industrial electric motors, mechanical power transmission products, drives and generators, will expand its Weaverville operations.† The company plans to invest more than $4.8 million and create 32 jobs during the next three years.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $64,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

ìNorth Carolina remains attractive to thriving companies like this one,î Gov. Perdue said.† ìOur top-ranked business climate and knowledge-based workforce help keep our manufacturing sector strong and diverse, providing the good jobs our citizens have come to expect.î

Baldor Electric Co., headquartered in Arkansas, operates 26 manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Canada, England, Mexico and China, and provides products to more than 70 countries. Three of the companyís plants are in North Carolina, employing a combined workforce of nearly 700 people.

Baldor is consolidating its Sleevoil hydrodynamic bearing line in Indiana and moving those operations to its Weaverville plant, which currently employs 128 workers.† The 32 new jobs added over the next three years will pay an average wage of $42,209, not including benefits, which is higher than the Buncombe County average of $32,968.

This project follows two other recent One NC Fund announcements for Baldor facilities in Western North Carolina.† In June, Gov. Perdue announced 114 new jobs and an investment of $12.2 million in Cleveland County.† In May, the governor announced 25 new jobs and an investment of $3.1 million in McDowell County.

"Booze It & Lose It: Operation Firecracker"

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that state and local law enforcement officers will be out in full force over the Fourth of July holiday as part of the ìBooze It & Lose It: Operation Firecrackerî campaign. Checkpoints and stepped-up patrols will be conducted Monday, June 29, through Sunday, July 5, across the state in an effort to remove impaired drivers from the roads.

ìToo many people fail to understand that alcohol and driving donít mix. Impaired driving is no accident, nor is it a victimless crime,î Perdue said. ìLaw enforcement officers will crack down on impaired drivers, ensuring that everyone is celebrating the holiday responsibly.î

There were 377 alcohol-related crashes, 322 with injuries and 12 that resulted in fatalities, over the Independence Day week last year.

Officers charged more than 1,900 North Carolina motorists with driving while impaired during the 2008 ìBooze It & Lose It: Operation Firecrackerî campaign. More than 5,700 stepped-up patrols and checkpoints were held.

†††† I am again voicing my opinion...How can it be justified that the members of the House and Senate cost our state $5 million a day when they should have completed the budget by the end of June?† Our state is trying to balance the budget, but how can that be done with this unnecessary spending.† They knew when their deadline was and should be held accountable to have completed the budget on time.† As a teacher, if I don't complete work, I have to work on my own time to get things in on time.† Why are out Legislators not held to the same standards that not only education, but most businesses are held to as far as completing tasks by due dates?† I feel that since the House and the Senate members want to act like children and not resolve their differences they do not deserve to be paid for their "over time".† Maybe this would make them stick to deadlines and work together for what is BEST for North Carolina and the people of North Carolina.† They all seem to have their own personal agendas rather than looking at the entire picture and deciding what is best for the people of North Carolina.† It is time they grow up, put their differences aside, and act like adults while maintaining a deadline.† I feel that this is a common feeling of a great many of the citizens that these elected officials represent.† But are they really representing the wishes of the people or are they just concerned about their own agendas???

Gov. Perdue Calls on General Assembly to Protect Public Education in the State Budget



The state is currently facing a record budget shortfall of $4.7 billion.† Legislators are working hard to close the enormous gap, but there have been brutal cuts proposed to public education.† Cuts proposed

so far to education are troubling: increases in class size and elimination of more than 6,000 thousand teachers and thousands more teaching assistants.





Gov. Perdue this week continued to call on the General Assembly to make smart,†tough cuts in the budget and to raise the revenue necessary to protect our classrooms.†

She held rallies in Wilmington and Greenville on Monday and released a video message on Tuesday.

Gov. Perdue Launches "United We Serve" Campaign



Gov. Bev Perdue this week

announced that the Governor‚Äôs Office and the state‚Äôs departments and agencies will participate in United We Serve, a national effort launched by President Obama to engage more Americans in serving their communities this summer.





‚ÄúThese 11 weeks are a time for North Carolinians to take the lead in organizing service projects and forging partnerships with local organizations to get their communities back on track,‚Äù Perdue said. ‚ÄúWhether you are working in a soup kitchen,

reading to a child or helping out a friend in need, everyone‚Äôs small efforts can create some big results.‚Äù





The campaign kicks off June 22 and runs through September 11, which will be marked for the first time as a national day of service and remembrance.† The initiative focuses on four key areas: education, health, community renewal, and energy

and the environment.† It is being led by the Corporation for National and Community Service, a federal agency that improves lives and strengthens communities through volunteering and service.





The governor will focus on mentoring during the summer of service campaign.† Cabinet secretaries will volunteer with different nonprofits and advocacy groups throughout the summer as well.† The governor also encourages state employees to use

their allotted 24 community service hours in support of the initiative and to help get North Carolina back on track.





The Obama administration created <http://www.serve.gov/>www.serve.gov, a Web site that allows visitors to find local volunteer opportunities†by

typing in their zip code and†allows organizations

to recruit volunteers by posting their projects.









Federal Energy Department OKs NC Plan to Use Recovery Fund to Create Green Jobs, Save Energy



Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week

that the U.S. Energy Department has approved North Carolina‚Äôs $75.9 million Energy Plan to improve energy efficiency, promote greater use of renewable energy resources and create more green jobs.† The program will be funded through the state‚Äôs share

of federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act†(ARRA)

funds.





‚ÄúWith this approval, North Carolina is prepared to quickly move ahead to create jobs and position our state to become a national leader in green

energy,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue.† ‚ÄúI have directed the State Energy Office and other agencies to move as fast as possible to put these funds to work creating jobs and building North Carolina‚Äôs green economy.‚Äù





Through†ARRA funding to the State Energy Program, North Carolina is significantly increasing its investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy, building its sustainable energy economy and workforce

and promoting innovation and development of new energy technologies and resources.





The federal Energy Department has given the state the go-ahead to start the program and spend $30.4 million.† The state will receive the remaining funds as it shows it has successfully implemented the plan.





North Carolina is focusing on six areas for federal Recovery Act State Energy Program:






- Supporting small businesses and industry through energy savings,†


- Growing North Carolina‚Äôs green workforce through JobsNow,†


- Developing an Energy Investment Revolving Loan Fund,†


- Improving government energy efficiency,†


- Promoting residential energy efficiency and renewable energy, and†


- Fostering renewable energy technology and resource innovation.





‚ÄúWe will increase our energy efficiency, use new and emerging technologies; and develop creative partnerships with the private and nonprofit sectors,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said.







Take Your Dog To Work Day



Today, June 26, is "Take Your Dog To Work Day."† The day was created to†celebrate the great companions dogs make and to encourage pet adoptions.†

Gov. Perdue was happy to participate.










Today she brought North Carolina's First Dogs, Dosie and Zipper, to work.† You can read more about these two Tibetan Terriers on

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstFamily/dosieZipper.aspx>their webpage.







31 Highway Contracts Awarded, Including 11 Recovery Projects



Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week

that 31 contracts totaling $73 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including 11 projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The contracts were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene

Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.





‚ÄúAll of these projects will help generate new jobs and economic development for North Carolina, as well as improve travel

throughout our state,‚Äù Perdue said.





According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.





The 11 recovery projects awarded are located in Bertie, Davidson, Davie, Durham, Franklin, Granville, Guilford, Lee, Stokes, Transylvania and Watauga counties. The 20 other projects awarded are located in Anson, Buncombe, Cabarrus, Catawba,

Cumberland, Granville, Henderson, Iredell, Lincoln, Madison, Mecklenburg, Mitchell, New Hanover, Polk, Sampson, Stanly, Transylvania, Warren and Yancey counties. Work on all contracts will start in July.

Cleveland County Manufacturer to Add 114 Jobs



Baldor Electric Co., an international supplier of industrial electric motors, mechanical power transmission products, drives and generators, will expand its Kings Mountain operations.† The company plans to invest more than $12.2 million and

create 114 jobs during the next three years.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $157,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.





‚ÄúNorth Carolina‚Äôs manufacturing sector remains strong and diverse,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said.† ‚ÄúOur state is attractive to growing companies because of our highly skilled

workforce, business-friendly climate and tremendous quality of life.‚Äù





Baldor Electric Co., headquartered in Arkansas, operates 26 manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada, England, Mexico and China and provides products to more than 70 countries. Three of the company‚Äôs plants are in North Carolina,

in Kings Mountain, Marion and Weaverville, employing a combined workforce of nearly 700 people.





Baldor is consolidating operations from South Carolina and moving those manufacturing processes to facilities in other states, including the Kings Mountain plant, which currently employs more than 500

workers.† The 114 new jobs added over the next three years will pay an average wage of $38,329, not including benefits, which is higher than the Cleveland County average of $31,720.

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt 
the impact of the national recession,¬†which
many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our state‚Äôs unemployment rate has almost doubled and now 
stands at 11.1 percent ‚Äî 7th highest in the nation. Just as North 
Carolina‚Äôs families have been hurt by the recession, so has our state‚Äôs 
budget.


The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a 
decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 
fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest 0D
shortfalls in the country, and it is the
 largest in North Carolina‚Äôs history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve 
significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office 
in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of
  accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolina‚Äôs government 
is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what 
little we have in these tough times.

This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the 
public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We 
have instituted more accountability and transparency in our state‚Äôs 
mental health and probation systems,
  and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the 
Department of Transportation.

Through my JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to 
work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to 
new job opportunities. One example is my

12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain 
workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish 
this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, 
I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and 
education, priorities that establish
 a strong base for North Carolina‚Äôs long-term economic growth.

Since that=2
0time, however, the state budget hole has increased by 
another $1 billion.

As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included 
profound cuts to core government services.

We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect¬†core education, 
public safety and health care services,¬†or we can allow the economic 
crisis to cripple our classrooms.

Public education always¬†has
been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolina‚Äôs economy 
toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs.
Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and 
would cut short our long-term economy.

As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we 
will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut 
to the bone.

I‚Äôve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue 
necessary to protect¬†public education.¬† Now I need your help.¬† The 
budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital
  services, including health care and public safety.¬† But if we act now 
we can save thousands of jobs and protect our children‚Äôs education.

The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to 
pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the 
classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.

¬†

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Sincerely,

I do not understand how you can say 7th Highest Unemployment Rate in the nation and raise taxes in the same breath!! You people in Raleigh were elected to solve the state's problems but by raising taxes you are only pushing off on the citizenry the burden of higher taxes that will give you more money to spend on programs and policies that don't work. It is time to do the job †you were sent to Raleigh to do - manage the state in a responsible way and cut spending on unnecessary projects and programs that don't produce results or that are not economically sound. Every household has had to economize, so now it is the state's turn.
NO MORE TAXES!!

	I am firmly against any tax increases no matter what the income of the individual or the business. Cutting taxes is the only way to improve the economy.†
The state government needs to balance its budget by cutting its wasteful spending.
I have been a North Carolinian for nearly 40 years and I am embarrassed that the state is in such a financial mess.† More of the same will not fix the problem.

Another "temporary tax". In NC these "temporary" taxes don't stay temporary (www.taxfoundation.org/blog/show/22332.html). After the economy rebounds (as unlikely as that is while Marxists run Washington), the "temporary" tax will become a "revenue surplus" which will get squandered on pet projects and pork.

Governor "Lucy" Perdue and Dems in Raleigh keep holding the political football and the "Charlie Brown" voters of NC just keep trusting them. Then we'll wonder again why we're flat on our backs. Good grief!

I have read your report ... of the following regarding your Balanced Budget ...

"Those steps include targeted tax relief to middle-class families, along with child, family and home-related credits. It also outlines permanent reductions to sales, income and business tax rates."

My wages are considered ... middle-class - (single-parent ... with no exemptions)†... and I have worked hard for this kind of income.† One thing I want to specify is ... someone needs to look out for the tax payers like myself.† I have been a single parent for 21 years ... and I could not claim my children ... because my ex- was awarded the right to claim them.† Although, I had full custody ... and my ex was in another state ... and that state gave my ex the right to claim him ... my family suffered having to try to pay the income tax that were require by my filing .. just head of household.† Now that my children are older ... I'm still trying to help them along (without help from their father)... as all parents do to get them on their feet after their college degrees ... I think there should be another way to categorized my status as a tax payer ... instead of single ... that takes out quite a bit of money ... and it's not fair.† I think there should be a rule in place for ... if the tax payer is a certain age and†has children ... although ... they are of age ... they will have some grace period to file a different tax exemption ... that will help them have the needed funds.

Thank You,
Donna Wright

I have a GREAT way to increase the income to the stateís budget.



As a resident of NC since 1975, I have seen an exponential increase in both speeders (well over the 10+ mph over the posted rate) on nearly every road in the state as well as more people running through red lights more than ever before.



Not only do these behaviors cause accidents, deaths and tie up the time of state troopers and local law enforcement, but they also breed a general disregard for laws in general.



So, how about randomly and persistently placing unmarked cars along the stateís roads and fine the offenders.



The state government could easily recoup the cost of the state troopersí salaries, their vehicle maintenance costs, AND go a long way in restoring the trust and confidence in law enforcement in North Carolina!



What do you say?

We cannot allow this recession to devastate our children‚Äôs education and our state‚Äôs future, and I hope you will join me as we continue to take that message to the General Assembly.

Cut the pork. Do not raise sales taxes! The State of North Carolina salary cut of 1/2 of 1% is a joke. Other citizens of North Carolina are losing jobs and taking major pay cuts and you want to just cut State of N.C. employees this pidly pay cut†but now raise our sales taxes.†

Pathway to a Balanced Budget

	I have asked them not to support a hike in taxes.† It is totally wrong to raise taxes on those who are unemployed.† What if we cut state workers by the same percentage that we have unemployed in our state.† That should balance your budget.† It takes real leadership to not raise taxes.

	You don't balance the budget by simply raising taxes.† Eliminate 10% of all entitlement programs year by year and you won't have an issue.

Perdue seeks 1-cent hike in sales tax

$1.6 billion plan to balance state's budget would also raise taxes on beer cans, cigarettes, high incomes.

* Perdue

MORE INFORMATION

* <javascript:void(0);>Ready for a nose-job tax?
RALEIGH Gov. Bev Perdue asked legislative leaders Tuesday to pass a 1-cent sales tax increase, the latest and largest tax hike proposal so far in the state's lingering economic crisis.

It's part of her tax package that could raise $1.6 billion to balance the budget, and an attempt to end the legislative stalemate that has left the state without a spending plan since June 30. She warned that for each day without a budget, the state misses out on $5 million in revenue from tax increases and budget cuts.

The governor's wish list includes a 1-cent increase in the sales tax that would expire in October 2010. She also proposed an income tax surcharge on single taxpayers who earn more than $500,000 and married couples filing jointly making more than $1 million. The surcharge would end after two years.

She characterized the increases as emergency measures. A deficit between $1.1 billion and $4.7 billion ñ depending on the benchmarks used ñ has left the state looking at deep cuts and tax increases to reach a balanced budget.

North Carolinians are still paying part of tax increases passed in 2001 and characterized as temporary, and Perdue was asked why residents should place more faith in that term now.

ìBecause I'm governor,î Perdue said at a brief news conference outside the capitol.

Her plan met mixed reviews in the legislature, where the House and Senate are at an impasse over what taxes to increase and by how much.

ìThere are some suggestions she made that would help us move off center,î said House Speaker Joe Hackney, a Chapel Hill Democrat.

Senate leader Marc Basnight, a Manteo Democrat, dismissed the $1.6 billion figure and said lawmakers would increase taxes by no more than $1.2 billion.

Sen. Dan Clodfelter, a Charlotte Democrat and a co-chairman of the finance committee, said he saw nothing new in Perdue's page-long menu of tax changes. ìShe took every option anyone had ever mentioned and put it on a list,î Clodfelter said.

It was unclear how much revenue Perdue actually sought to raise. Perdue aides later in the day qualified her comments to emphasize that she was not insisting on a $1.6 billion total.

ìThis is a list of options that lawmakers can choose from,î said Chrissy Pearson, Perdue's press secretary. ìThe end goal is not to raise $1.6 billion. The end goal is to raise enough to protect North Carolina's core services, especially public education. That number, in Governor Perdue's mind, needs to be well in excess of $1 billion.î

Perdue wants a 50-cent-per-pack increase in cigarette taxes, down from the $1 per pack she requested in March, plus 2 cents more on cans of beer and a 2 percent increase on alcohol.

The so-called ìsin taxesî are viewed as regressive, hitting the poor disproportionately. A higher sales tax could provide a large and immediate source of revenue, but is also unstable because it fluctuates with the economy.

Response skeptical

Taxpayers offered a largely skeptical, and sometimes hostile, response on Web sites, in blog postings and in interviews.

ìIt's going to make the severe recession in our state that much worse,î said David Williams, a Raleigh financial planner who has volunteered in Republican campaigns.

Andrew Edmonds, a rising junior political science major at Appalachian State University, offered one of the few positive assessments: ìIt hits everybody fairly.î

The list included several tax increases that would take effect in the fall of next year, including taxes on some warranties, installations and repairs. Perdue also proposed a tax increase on ìluxury servicesî such as cosmetic surgery, limousines and chartered flights.

Perdue, a Democrat, presented lawmakers with the tax list during meetings at the Executive Mansion. It was her third position on taxes since early June.

On June 4 she said a tax increase might be needed and that she was ìvery seriously looking at all the options.î Two weeks later she called for a $1.5 billion tax increase.

She said the additional revenue would be ìto protect the public schools and the educational backbone in North Carolina, and to also help keep this enterprise being fixed that we're committed to fix ñ whether it be corrections or mental health.î

I am very concerned with the governorís recent comments and recent actions in the legislature concerning new taxes and increased tax rates.



The introduction of taxes on services, increased sales tax, increased gas tax, and new taxes on clubs show a lack of regard for maintaining the stateís competitiveness in recruiting jobs and spending into the state.† In order for the state to maintain our relative strength and standard of living, we must be an attractive place for those outside our state to spend and invest.



Further, the stateís assets have been squandered in recent years through irresponsible budgeting and spending.† The ìEducationî lottery has been raided, as well as the ìrainy day fundî, the transportation fund, end of year surpluses, and other long term assets that were intended for years such as this one.† The legislature does not merit the trust of new taxpayer funds.



I urge you to return the state budget to a level of spending within the current tax structure.† The citizens of our state are cutting our personal budgets in these tough times, there is no justification that our government should not do the same.



Thanks very much!

Subject: [Office of Governor Bev Perdue] Pathway to a Balanced Budget





<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/>



Pathway to a Balanced Budget

Yesterday, I presented lawmakers with a clear pathway to a balanced budget that raises the revenue necessary to protect public schools and other core services in health and public safety. Combined with $3.8 billion in cuts, the pathway modernizes the state tax code in a way that is fair to working families.

Those steps include targeted tax relief to middle-class families, along with child, family and home-related credits. It also outlines permanent reductions to sales, income and business tax rates.

With the fiscal year already a week old, local governments, schools, service providers and families across North Carolina are in limbo regarding what resources and services will be available to them.

I continue to urge the General Assembly to work quickly to pass a budget that protects public schools and other vital services, and I have provided them with a clear pathway to do so.

We cannot allow this recession to devastate our childrenís education and our stateís future, and I hope you will join me as we continue to take that message to the General Assembly.

Governor Perdue,
You are doing a great job. I know it is difficult. I apprecaite you efforts towards the budget. I think you should review the schools to make sure that they are spending money for education. Maybe a review fo programs at schools would give you a better idea of what is going on. We need to educate childern for the future and education must provide that for them.
Retired teacher,
Cheryl Luc

†Dear Gov. Perdue,
††††† We cannot allow this economy to be used as a reason to raise taxes and give government more control over our lives. Government has got to cut back and that means layoffs and eliminating jobs that are overlapping due to the huge increase in the size of government...I'm not working now and have not been since Oct. of 08...I don't qualify for any assistance nor do I want any, but if you would like to hire me to show you how to meet a budget and to get much, much, much, much, much more out of employees, lower taxes, stimulate growth and make our state a destination again I'd be happy to do it. If you raise taxes here you are going to ruin this state completely....South Carolina will appreciate it I'm sure. Tim T

†Dear Governor Purdue:
††††† Without any specifics, the email I received seems to have admirable goals for balancing the state budget.† But the size of the NC (and Federal) government did not get to be the size it has now reached overnight.† I still favor cutting the size of government.† Americans of decades ago made out without without a government nearly the size of the current governments.† There†seems to be an unwrtten law that during difficult economic times, bureaucrats and all sorts of public employees get to keep their jobs whereas the job cutbacks are mostly restricted to the private sector.††So far, that is again the case with the current economic downturn.† There has to be some sort of innovative approach of using furloughs and service cutbacks so that more people can start doing for themselves what they have gotten accustomed to being provided by the state.† Something I find mentioned nowhere in this financial dilemma we are in is the cost to the†state of NC of the large number of illegal immegrants present and their burden on the state budget.† It's as if it is†something that is not up for discussion, a taboo subject.† Children are always mentioned as being unduly effected in times such as†these since it would take a pretty hard-hearted person to want any child to suffer needlessly.† I grew up in the days before free meals for eligible children at schools, and, although our family would probably have been considered poor, my mother always packed us a sandwich and†some sort of fruit for lunch.† We got by.† That's the sort of thing I'm talking about now - people just need to start relying on themselves more and less on government.
†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††Sincerely,
†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††† David H. Buss†††††

We cannot allow this recession to devastate our children‚Äôs education and our state‚Äôs future, and I hope you will join me as we continue to take that message to the General Assembly.

Pathway to a Balanced Budget

Yesterday, I presented lawmakers with a clear pathway to a balanced budget that raises the revenue necessary to protect public schools and other core services in health and public safety. Combined with $3.8 billion in cuts, the pathway modernizes the state tax code in a way that is fair to working families.

Those steps include targeted tax relief to middle-class families, along with child, family and home-related credits. It also outlines permanent reductions to sales, income and business tax rates.

With the fiscal year already a week old, local governments, schools, service providers and families across North Carolina are in limbo regarding what resources and services will be available to them.

I continue to urge the General Assembly to work quickly to pass a budget that protects public schools and other vital services, and I have provided them with a clear pathway to do so.

We cannot allow this recession to devastate our childrenís education and our stateís future, and I hope you will join me as we continue to take that message to the General Assembly.

The wording of your message is a smokescreen for higher taxes across the board, including higher income taxes on the middle class.  Why aren't you sharing the specifics of your plan to North Carolina residents?  Also, outline the specifics in language that general lay individuals can understand.

How is this possible when all I've seen in the newspaper recently is how you'd like to increase sales tax which would definitely tax all North Carolinians and would definitely, unfairly tax lower and middle class people. 

This sounds like you're talking out of both sides of your mouth. You're never going to balance the budget unless you cut out pork spending. 

Sincerely, 

Sam McCall
