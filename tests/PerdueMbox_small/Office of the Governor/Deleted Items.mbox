Comment: Gov. Perdue: Congratulations on your historic victory. I work in a 27/7/365 crisis unit for MH & SA. Please allow those of us working with these consumers to have a voice in developing ways to provide services that have been cut. Too many consumers are falling through the cracks due to lack of services and medications. Many are homeless and need assisted living and/or affordable housing. We cannot fix the problem immediately but we can if we address it one day at a time. Thank you, Deborah Young, MS, LPC, LCAS, CSI, CRC

Subject: Congratulation and Good Luck

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue; I am a citizen of NC, and a State employee. I wanted to wish you Congratulations and Good Luck. We (citizens and State employees) are all in this together and I know we can once again get this economy turned around and make NC even greater than before. My only wish is that the current problems are not solved on the backs of State employees. We have been tightening our belt and I am sure we can tighten it some more, but this has to be the same for all not just select State employees. When we hear of special groups getting larger increases than others and when Legislative staff get hugh pay raises it hurts. It is even demoralizing. Please treat each and every State employee, including the Counsel of State and your staff the same. Hold people accountable, insist that wiser decisions need to be made Legislatively. Please hold true to your promises during the campaign and I know that NC will soon be on its feet and leading the nation in a recovery. Again, congratulations and good luck. Pete Krupp

Subject: Stimulus Alternative

Comment: Rather than the government spending another $700 billion in stimulus why not consider a $70 billion alternative that would be equally divided among approx. 200 million US citizens 18 yrs and older and taxed at 30%, that's less than $50 billion outlay that would put roughly $245k in each pocket, it would alleviate the housing and auto markets, allow ppl to pay their own health care, college educations, address homelessness, welfare, back taxes, crime, why has no one seriously looked at this as an immediate solution to the impending depression rather than spending more money that will take years to recover and recoup? I urge you to look into this idea.

I congratulate you on your new position. A new start in NC is just what's necessary.

I have written before to the governor's office but received no response.

Years ago almost $2 M was budgeted for a law enforcement shooting range†for the Justice Academy in Hendersonville. At that time, $300,000 was also set aside for buying land in a rural area. Down the road, the $300,000 was eliminated but the budgeted amount for a shooting range for the Justice Academy remained. Now, plans have been made to put a Pistol Range, Combat Range and Sniper/Rifle Range at the academy within 30 yards of homes, a road used by school buses, and within† one mile† of approximately 1000 residences. Our County Commission is opposed. Our legislator is opposed. A community petition of 450 signatures show our community opposition. A community meeting with Justice Academy personnel resulted in a clear†exhibit of neighborhood outrage by over 200 attendees. Multiple editorials and letters in our paper have expressed amazement for such a absurd proposal. It has been said that it's the state's money and they can do whatever they want.†! Despite all of this, construction is supposed to start next month. The Environmental study is loaded with errors and mistruths. No report or study has been made public on the impact of the noise.To enclose the facility, an additional $3 M would be required. The Justice Academy has land available at no cost that could accommodate the shooting range and cost half of the budgeted $2M in a rural area near Big Hungry. Justice Academy officials responded that this would be inconvenient for the 2000 officers requiring annual re certification.
The reduction in property values from noise pollution for the 1000 homes affected might be inconvenient for the state.

This is just flat absurd.

Please withdraw the $2M of funds for this project.

Please do not consider adding more funds for the destruction of our community.
Is our state so abundant in funds that this $2 M could not be used for a better purpose?
Yes, we need a new beginning. One where pork barrel, state funded, unnecessary and unwanted projects aren't forced on the people of any community.

Please step up. As they say, "First do no harm".

Subject: NC lottery

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: I would like to congratulate you on becoming governor of this great state yesterday. We live in a wonderful place. I know there are many challenges you will face, not the least of which is the looming budget deficit, estimated to be anywhere from one to three billion dollars. One of my concerns is the emphasis we continue to place on the lottery in NC. I have recently seen numerous ads on television for the lottery, as if this is some panacea that will solve all our problems. Putting the word "education" in the name of the lottery only serves as an attempt to legitimize what is legalized gambling. Here we are as a state a billion or so dollars in the hole, and we are encouraging people to buy lottery tickets. A few may win, but most are frittering their dollars away on a pipe dream. It seems to me we have more serious issues than funding a lottery, particularly so when you look at the volume of dollars already inclded in the state budget for education. People need to conserve their resources for the rainy day that is now here rather than pouring them down the drain for what will be a futile attempt at instant riches for most. Success comes from hard work, not from idleness, and to promote the lottery when people are losing their jobs right and left seems to be the wrong way to right the ship. I love this place in which we live, as I know you do. It just seems incongruous to me to be pushing the lottery when we have much larger issues with which we have to deal. Sincerely and Respectfully, Reg Garner, President - TW Garner Food Company, Winston-Salem

Subject: How to handle crime and violence

Comment: Hello, My name is Jonathan Hill. I am a 20 year old, concerned resident of N.C. If you watch the news or turn on the radio, you will see and hear a great deal about the chaos that reigns in our state. From drug sales to murder, there seems to be no end to the insanity. But I come with a beacon of hope. "The Way To Happiness". This booklet is a non-religious guide on how to live a happier and more productive life. It contains 21 precepts that, when followed, will bring about a happy community free of violence, crime, and chaos. If one were to visit www.thewaytohappiness.org, one would find an amazing amount of information about what this little booklet as done in places plagued with war, drug and arms trafficking, gang related activity and much much more. So why am I mailing you about this book? Because I see an area that is drenched in the filth of crime and drugs and I want to offer you the tools that have been proven time and time again to solve the same problems that I see in our state. My friends and have already started to hand these booklets out to people. But our group is too small to make the big difference that needs to be made. With your help, we can make this state the shinning light house that acts as a beacon of hope for the entire U.S.A.

Subject: Excellent Start

Comment: Government accessibility, or lack of, in Raleigh has been my biggest issue for at least the last five years. Sadly our great state had gotten away from government by and for the people. It has been nearly impossible to get through to any government agency. When the campaigns began I was determined to support the candidate who made this change a priority even if it meant crossing over from my Democratic roots. I emailed the Perdue, Moore and Mccrory campaigns and none of them answered my issue. I was undecided in the primary until I got inside the booth where I voted Perdue. Before the general election I again made my plea to both camps and again was ignored. I made my decision again in the voting booth and again for Perdue although honestly I was expecting four more years of the same we have now. When I saw that Governor Perdue's first official act was signing the bill for greater accountability and accessibility I was greatly relieved and hopeful. What a great way to start. I hope it is sustained and I feel good for the first time about my choices in the voting booth. I just wonder how the campaign staff missed the importance of this issue. The general election would not have been close had they emphasized this issue. Congratulations and thank you Govenor Perdue.

Yes its been hard and then they penalize the ones who owe taxes and not give us the Stimulus Check. That is not fair. Because we are in more hardship than the one that need bailing out. And they get help but we don't. I hope that you fight for us older ones that need there stimulus check. Please make a difference I would love to come in and talk to you and speak for many voices of feeling a change, wanting a change,and know that they are part of the change. That's change! these are real problems and some is to ashamed to talk about it because feeling like they have fell there families.

Subject: Thank you

Comment: I have worked in law enforcement since 1994. I worked for the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office. This Sheriff's Office is the very first to have a lady as Sheriff. I was very lucky to serve under Ms. Barbara Pickens. I quit full time and went to work for the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles, Driver License Section. I now work full time at NCDMV and part time as an officer at Lincoln County Sheriff's Office. Myself as well as my family voted for you and are very excited to have you as Governor. I would love for you to visit the Town of Lincolnton when you can. It would be an honor to meet you. My mother owns a real estate company in Lincolnton, (Carolina Realty). My mother has been asked to run for Mayor and then on the City Council. My grandmother is very ill so that has set her back. My father works at a funeral home and is also a Fireman with the city of Lincolnton. I just wanted to say thank you for everything you have planned for the state of North Carolina. I can not wait to see what you have instore for us. I just know things will be better. Thank you and have a blessed day, Tammy Ballard

Subject: NC Health Benefits

Comment: Please consider carefully in increases in co pays, etc. Salary for school employees is low and one of the nice benefits was knowing we had health care with no premiums for the employee and affordable deductables. Also, we were pretty confident that our retirement benefits were well protected. These are two very important items in the employment of teachers. Please do not do anything that will reduce those benefits or risk our retirement accounts. Thank you.

Subject: Tax Payer Funding for Political Campaigning

Comment: The Honorable Bev Purdue; As one of your constituents, who voted for you as well as a retired senior citizen living on a fixed income I am writing to express my extreme opposition to Governor Purdue's proposal, advanced on her first day to create a taxpayer-supported endowment fund that would provide equal amounts of campaign money to gubernatorial candidates, forcing North Carolinians to fund candidates with which they may or may not agree. If you get your way, North Carolinians will have their political speech rights curbed and their taxes raised to fund candidates they disagree with,‚Äù said Dallas Woodhouse, state director for Americans for Prosperity-North Carolina.. ‚ÄúAn endowment would only encourage a potentially unconstitutional way to fund future campaigns for governor.‚Äù The endowment for the first time would regulate which issues candidates could speak about, restricting political debate. "North Carolina has a long history of tough political campaigns, which is the cornerstone of a strong and healthy democracy,‚Äù said Woodhouse. ‚ÄúThe thought of a group of people selected by politicians deciding what candidates can or cannot say or is frightening. Voters are quite capable of deciding what political speech is acceptable and these decisions are best left to the market place of ideas controlled by the voters.‚Äù I oppose the idea for several reasons including: * Taxpayers would be forced to fund the plan funds as they have with council of state races * Although the plan is supposed to be voluntary, unwilling candidates would be forced into the system. * The plan creates unacceptable restrictions on political speech * The plan appears to be unconstitutional and will create long and expensive court battles.

†Governor Bev,

††† I first want to congratulate you on your successful run for the Governors office. I knew from the first time I met you when you were the Jr. senator for our area that you where going to the top. George Murray Thomas would be mighty proud of you. Charles and I were talking today about the times he remembered you at the kitchen table talking to his dad and eating beans.You have set the example for more people than you know. Hard work and HONESTY will lead you to the goals that one desires.

†† †My daughter admires you as a person with the drive to achieve a goal that in the past would have been impossible. She is the treasurer for the†Young Democrats at West Carteret High, and I feel sure that you†played a big part in her wanting to serve in that position, and I would like to thank you for that.

††† We are going to get things for the Pig Cooking at the Mansion in line as soon as Paul Pittman lets us know. I talked to Mickey Simmons†and he is ready to get to cooking. Let us know how much you want cooked and we†will take care of the rest.

††† In closing†I again want to tell you how extremely proud of you my family is, and we know you will serve The Great State†Of North Carolina at a level that has never been seen.†God Bless You and your Family.


††† Vr,

Steve Thrower and Family†

Dear Governor Beverly Perdue:

Please support comprehensive legislation which will prohibit smoking in public places in North Carolina.  As your constituent, I want you to know that I am opposed to individuals smoking inside indoor public places.  Exposure to secondhand smoke is a health hazard that causes or makes worse a wide range of adverse health effects, including heart attacks, cancer, and asthma. I believe that all workers should be protected from secondhand smoke in the workplace.

My support for a smoke-free environment is not in the minority.  North Carolinians are voicing their support for smoke-free policies.  According to an Elon University poll in 2006, 86 percent of North Carolinians agree or strongly agree that employees in North Carolina should be able to work in a smoke-free environment.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that as little as 30 minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease.

Can we really allow workers who must make a living and our children who visit public places with their families to breathe in air that is full of carcinogens?  By helping to prohibit smoking in public places and worksites, you will play an important role in ensuring an immediate and dramatic impact on the health of everyone living and visiting our Tarheel state.

We canít wait any longer; all those who live and visit North Carolina need to know they are safe in a smoke-free North Carolina.  I urge you to support comprehensive legislation which will prohibit smoking in public places in North Carolina.

Subject: concerns of the middle class and lower class people

Comment: I have read todays articles and establishments from our new Governor's office, but right now.... I think the people of this state need to see something that supports our many people with no jobs. No one in this state should have to pay two sets of taxes each year. They should pay either city or state but not both. Also, I think people 65 and older should not have to pay taxes at all. The other concern among the not so wealthy is unless they want to be annexed into the town,county people should have the right to decide...not the town. The way it is set up now is that the small people are taken advantage of and our political voices allow this to continue. This needs to stop immediately. Work on these two items for low income and senior citizens will improve the observe support our new Governor will get, because it will show the people she is truely concerned.

Subject: NC Needs to Reduce Govt Spending and Balance the Budget

Comment: I hope you are doing well. I am writing because I am concerned that federal and state governments believe they need to spend in order to lessen the current economic downturn. I am concerned about your comments that the state budget may not be balanced due to declining revenues and the spending you believe is necessary. An elected official should never think that a budget deficit is acceptable. I know you are hampered by the previous administration and an economic downturn that is not in your control. However, you should show fiscal responsibility during this crisis by balancing the state budget just as individuals throughout North Carolina need to balance their own personal checkbooks as they lose jobs and income. If individuals cannot run a personal budget deficit, neither should the government. Your administration can be an example for North Carolinians who need to learn about fiscal responsibility and to live within their means. I urge you to consider the points made by Peter Schiff in the below Wall Street Journal article as you set the priorities for your administration. By PETER SCHIFF As recession fears cause the nation to embrace greater state control of the economy and unimaginable federal deficits, one searches in vain for debate worthy of the moment. Where there should be an historic clash of ideas, there is only blind resignation and an amorphous queasiness that we are simply sweeping the slouching beast under the rug. With faith in the free markets now taking a back seat to fear and expediency, nearly the entire political spectrum agrees that the federal government must spend whatever amount is necessary to stabilize the housing market, bail out financial firms, liquefy the credit markets, create jobs and make the recession as shallow and brief as possible. The few who maintain free-market views have been largely marginalized. Taking the theories of economist John Maynard Keynes as gospel, our most highly respected contemporary economists imagine a complex world in which economics at the personal, corporate and municipal levels are governed by laws far different from those in effect at the national level. Individuals, companies or cities with heavy debt and shrinking revenues instinctively know that they must reduce spending, tighten their belts, pay down debt and live within their means. But it is axiomatic in Keynesianism that national governments can create and sustain economic activity by injecting printed money into the financial system. In their view, absent the stimuli of the New Deal and World War II, the Depression would never have ended. On a gut level, we have a hard time with this concept. There is a vague sense of smoke and mirrors, of something being magically created out of nothing. But economics, we are told, is complicated. It would be irresponsible in the extreme for an individual to forestall a personal recession by taking out newer, bigger loans when the old loans can't be repaid. However, this is precisely what we are planning on a national level. I believe these ideas hold sway largely because they promise happy, pain-free solutions. They are the economic equivalent of miracle weight-loss programs that require no dieting or exercise. The theories permit economists to claim mystic wisdom, governments to pretend that they have the power to dispel hardship with the whir of a printing press, and voters to believe that they can have recovery without sacrifice. As a follower of the Austrian School of economics I believe that market forces apply equally to people and nations. The problems we face collectively are no different from those we face individually. Belt tightening is required by all, including government. Governments cannot create but merely redirect. When the government spends, the money has to come from somewhere. If the government doesn't have a surplus, then it must come from taxes. If taxes don't go up, then it must come from increased borrowing. If lenders won't lend, then it must come from the printing press, which is where all these bailouts are headed. But each additional dollar printed diminishes the value those already in circulation. Something cannot be effortlessly created from nothing. Similarly, any jobs or other economic activity created by public-sector expansion merely comes at the expense of jobs lost in the private sector. And if the government chooses to save inefficient jobs in select private industries, more efficient jobs will be lost in others. As more factors of production come under government control, the more inefficient our entire economy becomes. Inefficiency lowers productivity, stifles competitiveness and lowers living standards. If we look at government market interventions through this pragmatic lens, what can we expect from the coming avalanche of federal activism? By borrowing more than it can ever pay back, the government will guarantee higher inflation for years to come, thereby diminishing the value of all that Americans have saved and acquired. For now the inflationary tide is being held back by the countervailing pressures of bursting asset bubbles in real estate and stocks, forced liquidations in commodities, and troubled retailers slashing prices to unload excess inventory. But when the dust settles, trillions of new dollars will remain, chasing a diminished supply of goods. We will be left with 1970s-style stagflation, only with a much sharper contraction and significantly higher inflation. The good news is that economics is not all that complicated. The bad news is that our economy is broken and there is nothing the government can do to fix it. However, the free market does have a cure: it's called a recession, and it's not fun, easy or quick. But if we put our faith in the power of government to make the pain go away, we will live with the consequences for generations. Mr. Schiff is president of Euro Pacific Capital and author of "The Little Book of Bull Moves in Bear Markets" (Wiley, 2008).

Subject: Tolls on I-95 & I-77

Comment: Governor Purdue President Eisenhower and the leaders of his day had a vision for our country that included the interstate highway system. This vision is now a reality and it's my feeling that the interstate highway system has helped our country and economy more that any single event in our country's history. The quickest way to ruin a good thing will be to put tolls on I-95 and I-77. The adjacent states will follow our lead and the end result will be an increase in the number of trucks and cars using our US highways like US 1, US 17, and US 421 which are not equipped to handle the increase in traffic. Our state began a path of highway construction years ago that has led to us having the 2nd largest number of paved highways in the nation. Instead of tolls, I believe an independent review of the NCDOT policies may be a better way to put our future highway needs in line with the other states. Please find a way to help solve our problems with highway financing that does not include tolls on the interstate system. Thank You, Dan Moore 3009 Taft Ct. Raleigh NC 27610

Subject: thank you

Comment: I want to say that already we are seeing a change from the administration we have been used to with you now coming into office, and it seems to be for the better! Thank you for keeping the public informed and please keep this trend going. For too many years the culture of corruption has been allowed to fester in Raleigh with special appointments to boards, shutting the public out of decisions that affect us, out of control spending, and even the attempt to shut the state auditor out of doing his job! You are doing a good job so far and the citizens of NC will be watching you closely. Please continue to fight the good fight for us and hopefully with your help we can get this state turned around!

Dear Governor Perdue,

Please support comprehensive legislation which will prohibit smoking in public places in North Carolina.  As your constituent, I want you to know that I am opposed to individuals smoking inside indoor public places.  Exposure to secondhand smoke is a health hazard that causes or makes worse a wide range of adverse health effects, including heart attacks, cancer, and asthma. I believe that all workers should be protected from secondhand smoke in the workplace.

My support for a smoke-free environment is not in the minority.  North Carolinians are voicing their support for smoke-free policies.  According to an Elon University poll in 2006, 86 percent of North Carolinians agree or strongly agree that employees in North Carolina should be able to work in a smoke-free environment.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that as little as 30 minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease.

Can we really allow workers who must make a living and our children who visit public places with their families to breathe in air that is full of carcinogens?  By helping to prohibit smoking in public places and worksites, you will play an important role in ensuring an immediate and dramatic impact on the health of everyone living and visiting our Tarheel state.

We canít wait any longer; all those who live and visit North Carolina need to know they are safe in a smoke-free North Carolina.  I urge you to support comprehensive legislation which will prohibit smoking in public places in North Carolina.


Sincerely,

Jennifer Zacke

I am told by the banks we must cut cost and layoff people to keep our business open. There is no bailout for the businesses that have done everything to survive this mess. Cut your budget as the rest of us have to.

Visitor: Mr. Kacy Denton

Address: 3169 Greystoke Ct, Belmont, NC 28012

Email: kacy@partinc.com

Subject: Property taxes

Comment: Governor Perdue: My comment is about the abusive use of taxation and how it effects the overall environment and relationship to the citizens of the United States. Please do not forget that every government official works for the people! The people do not work for government, although it seems the government has become so incredibly large, desperate to find more ways to tax and has disassociated itself so far from the people that government has become the fist slamming on the table step father. Government has forgotten who supplies the money and jobs. Americans do! Government produces nothing they only take from people who PRODUCE!!! Property taxes are the worst subjective and discriminatory action the government is involved in. It isn't based on size of house but where the house is or the view they have if they are on water. Here is the kicker, I thought we had a right to own property, we don't because we owe government for any property we will ever have. If the first and foremost action of a governor like yourself would see that a flat tax / sales tax would be the most fair way to govern then you would be working for the people. We all pay the same rate in gas tax, grocery tax, all sales taxes, social securtity tax etc., why not propterty tax. Better yet, do away with property tax so the people really can own their own property otherwise the government owns it because of unfair property tax. Sincerely Kacy Denton Good luck and God speed with all your endeavors as Governor.

Dear Governor Beverly Perdue:

Please support comprehensive legislation which will prohibit smoking in public places in North Carolina.  As your constituent, I want you to know that I am opposed to individuals smoking inside indoor public places.  Exposure to secondhand smoke is a health hazard that causes or makes worse a wide range of adverse health effects, including heart attacks, cancer, and asthma. I believe that all workers should be protected from secondhand smoke in the workplace.

My support for a smoke-free environment is not in the minority.  North Carolinians are voicing their support for smoke-free policies.  According to an Elon University poll in 2006, 86 percent of North Carolinians agree or strongly agree that employees in North Carolina should be able to work in a smoke-free environment.

Can we really allow workers who must make a living and our children who visit public places with their families to breathe in air that is full of carcinogens?  By helping to prohibit smoking in public places and worksites, you will play an important role in ensuring an immediate and dramatic impact on the health of everyone living and visiting our Tarheel state.
