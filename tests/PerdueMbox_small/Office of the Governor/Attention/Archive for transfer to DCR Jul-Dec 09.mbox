Governor Perdue:

I can't watch Baltimore Orioles and Washington National games at all from my home in Charlotte, NC, even if I buy the MLB package because the games are blacked out due to contractual agreements with local blackouts.  All because Time Warner refuses to carry MASN.  

The Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) is the local source for televised sports programming including 322 Major League Baseball games, NCAA basketball, football and lacrosse, and tons of local sports programming I can't get anywhere else.

My neighbors with DirecTV and Dish already get MASN, but my cable company (Time Warner) refuses to carry the network.  There are no cable company competitors in my area, so unless I switch to satellite, which I don't want to do for many reasons, I cannot watch these baseball games.  However I am at point not where I am fed up and might have to make the switch, rather than live my entire adult life not being able to watch my favorite team.

It's time for Time Warner to carry MASN.

Sincerely,

Michael Regan

Comment: Michael Gore 4805 Yorkwood Dr Greensboro, NC 27407-4065 September 3, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing on behalf of farm workers like Salvador Solis who are fighting for their right to be treated just like workers in every other industry. He says, "We are made of flesh and blood, just like everyone else. We work hard. We have families. We have dreams of a better future. We deserve to have a day of rest, to be paid overtime and to join a union if we choose just like everyone else." Under current law, farm workers are denied: * Overtime pay provisions of Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). * The minimum wage provisions of the FLSA (on farms that employ fewer than seven workers). * The child labor protections of the FLSA. The law's protections against the hazards of students working in shopping malls are stronger than the protections against children working in agriculture where toxic pesticides, heavy machinery and other hazards threaten their future. * The right to join labor unions and bargain collectively. Please do your best to right this wrong by supporting legislation that would remove exemptions for agriculture from the labor laws. Sincerely, Michael Gore 336-294-8268

Governor Perdue:

Time Warner-First I want to THANK you for adding the Big Ten Network.  I'm from the Big Ten Area and love seeing my teams playing here on TWC.  I ask that you please add MASN and NFL Network to the package.  I am willing to pay a few dollars more for these channels, whether they are on the basic package or the sports tier.  I am unable to see any Orioles or Nationals games even though I have the MLB Extra Innings package since they are on MASN.  I also want to be able to see the NFL games on the NFL Network during the season.  Please find a way to work with these companies to give the viewers these channels.  Thank you!

Governor Perdue:

It's time for Time Warner to play ball:

The Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) is the local source for televised sports programming including 322 Major League Baseball games, NCAA basketball, football and lacrosse, and tons of local sports programming I can't get anywhere else.

My neighbors with DirecTV, Dish, Mediacom or Charter already get MASN, but my cable company refuses to carry the network. 

That's because my provider, Time Warner, is blacking out MASN and preventing  me - and thousands of other local sports fans - from watching our local sports network.  And because of the Time Warner baseball blackout, I cannot watch the Washington Nationals or Baltimore Orioles games - which have been televised for years.

It's time for Time Warner to play ball and carry MASN.

Following is the question just received:
Visitor: Mr. Daniel Hood

Address: 211 Church St, Chapel Hill, NC 27516

Email: dmhood@gmail.com

Subject: Support Sensible Poker Legislation

Comment: Daniel Hood 211 Church Street Chapel Hill, NC 27516-2561 September 8, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: The U.S. Congress is considering legislation to license, regulate, and tax online games of skill like poker. The legislation contains a provision that allows states to opt out of the federal licensing program, and the choice for our state to stay in or opt out will come shortly after implementation of the legislation. As a constituent, voter, and proud poker player, I ask that you support keeping our state in this important program. U.S. House Bill H.R. 2267 and U.S. Senate Bill S. 1597 provide for sensible licensing, regulation, and taxation of Internet poker. They mandate rigorous, verifiable safeguards against underage participation while providing consumer protections for the millions, including many in our state, who play online poker every day. These bills also include dedicated funding to establish and implement programs for prevention and treatment of those with excessive gaming habits. Both bills benefit our state economically. According to an economic study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers in April, tax revenues from these bills will provide billions of dollars to the U.S. Treasury and to the states in the program. Additionally, the Senate bill provides for revenue-sharing with participating states, bringing even more much-needed funds into our state's coffers. Both bills allow American companies to participate in the world's Internet poker market, bringing needed jobs to our state as well. Solutions like H.R. 2267 and S. 1597 provide the most rational approach to controlling this industry and preserving it for adults who choose to engage in games of skill like poker. An unenforceable, unpopular prohibition provides none of these benefits. All prohibition can do is drive players underground or overseas while limiting my personal freedom. What's most important to me is your support for my rights. Please respond to this letter and let me know if you will support keeping our state in this important program. I will be watching your actions on this issue closely. I hope that I, along with my over one million fellow Poker Players Alliance members can count on your support. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Daniel Hood 2529033011

	To Whom it may Concern:

	I know several people who receive help from DSS (Department of Social Services).
	These people like to do rent a kid. Basically they ask family or friends
	to split tax return with them and their kids become their family or friends dependents
	for the year. They receive help from DSS and on top of that they commit fraud by renting their kids
	as dependents to people on taxes. The DSS agency should make all receipts of help show a tax return
	and should be verified through a quick on line tax return check that it was filled with the IRS.

	This step would also help to catch Illegal immigrants who are receiving DSS help and to help keep
	tax fraud down which would help the state in the long run. One person I know who is guilty of renting
	her kids out is Tammy (Ezzell) Dillion. Tammy allows her mother Bonnie Ezzell of
	822 Stone Street, Haw River NC 27258, Bonnie phone 336-578-5065 to claim her kids as dependents on
	tax returns while DSS pays Tammy Housing, receives Medicaid, food stamps and other various
	help from DSS for her family while tammy and bonnie ezzell commit tax fraud so Tammy can get
	more money out of the Government and that her mother would not owe taxes to the irs. her Mother
	 If the IRS had wanted to do a serious AUDIT on Tammy and her Mother than they would
	 a) contact Alamance County DSS at 336-570-6570 and have them copy there records
	and submit them to do an audit on Bonnie Ezzell and Tammy Dillion. B) contact Alamance county school board and get
	all of Draco Dill ions school background to check which school he has attended and the address they used to
	get him into those schools (School Board of Alamance county phone # 336-570-6060).

	If the IRS had verified any documents that was sent to them and verified with DSS information they could prove
	easily that the above named people have committed tax fraud. With the age of computers anyone can do up
	documents from home and no one would be the wiser about it if they came from a school, dss or a persons home
	computer without verifying from the source the validation of such documents. DSS Graham Housing during some
	of these years paid for Tammy, Draco, and Kyra housing and a letter from them alone would prove tax fraud. If Irs
	would place a few calls and validate information instead of just assuming documents submitted are accurate and
	done by the agency and not on someone homes computer.

	Bonnie Ezzell is also guilty of cheating on her unemployment by working under the table at Cindy's Food Mart
	330 Roxboro St Haw River NC 27258 PHONE: 336-578-2924. This way she draws her full unemployment amount
	and still try to have extra money. Bonnie Ezzell believes she can cheat the system and get away with it.

	HILLCREST Contact INFO: draco still from 1st grade until 3rd or 4th
	1714 W Davis Street Burlington NC 27215 (336) 570-6120 . Check any paperwork and verified it came from

Dear Governor Perdue and Secretary Cansler,

I'm writing to voice my concern over the Legislature's recent $2.3 million cut to the Special Assistance appropriation, which helps pay for care for residents in North Carolina's 1,400 assisted-living facilities.

While you can't undo the Legislature's cuts, you have it in your power to stand up and help more than 25,000 elderly North Carolinians whose lives will be negatively impacted by the Legislature's actions.

You can help by asking the federal Medicaid program to pay for the full range of health support services that adult care homes provide for residents, including:

Monitoring and supervising residents' health and mental health on a 24-hour basis

Managing their medications

Making sure they are eating right and getting the nutrition they need.

That will mean more federal Medicaid dollars for assisted-living residents in North Carolina. It will enable adult care homes to provide quality care. And it will mean better health care services for more than 25,000 of our state's most vulnerable citizens.

Medicaid is paying for those services today in many other states - and in nursing homes and home care right here in North Carolina. Why shouldn't Medicaid pay for the same services in adult care homes?

Please take action today to ensure that North Carolina's assisted-living residents get the care they need.

Dear Governor Perdue and Secretary Cansler,

I am writing to introduce myself and some of my assisted living residents that have been and will continue to be affected by the 2.3 million dollar cut to the Special Assistance budget. I know this can not be reversed, but after "meeting" some of "my folks"
I hope you will every power in your possession to fight the pending cut to Medicaid dollars for this same population of senior citizens.

"Richard" is a 94 yr old retired farmer from Eastern NC. Despite the hard work and hard times, as he calls it, he invested wisely & by having no luxeries for himself and his family in his earlier life, he saved enough money to pay privately at my assisted living facility, the Vintage Inn, the first two years he lived with us. Having exhaused his resources he became eligible for Medicaid and Special Assistance to help supplement his Social Security, although he hated the idea of being on "welfare".

"Alice" is a 72 year old disabled widow that could no longer live at home due to financial explortation. Her "loved ones" were right there with outstretched hand on the 3rd of each month waiting for her money, while her own needs went unmet. Months of this lead to verbal and physical abuse and deplorable home environment. Adult protective services ensured an end was put to this situation & "Alice" became one of our Vintage Inn family 16 months ago.

Lastly, "Mr. Lester" is 83 with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's. His family kept him at home as long as possible, until his wife's declining health made it necessary for placement in Vintage Inn's Memory Care Unit. Like most people with dementia, "Mr. Lester" wanders and is determined he needs to leave the facility at 7:00AM to go to work, like he did so-o-o many years of his life. It is amazing how a walk around the building with specially trained staff can offer him the validation needed of how important work is and the type of work he is familiar with. By the time "Mr. Lester" and his CNA have reached the front door of the facility again, he feels validated, accepts staff's offer of a cup of coffee with the promise of breakfast in just a few minutes.

These three wonderful seniors are but a sample of the residents at our facility. All three will be impacted by the Medicaid cut as will the other 110 residents I am responsible for. This cut will have to have an impact on the quality care they receive due to the termination of staff with which they are familiar and comfortable, as well as the quality of the meals and the nurtitional value necessary to promote/maintain skin tegor and hydration of the elderly population.

While I know a change must be made in the current Medicaid system, please investigate and cut less deserving programs, such as the numerous mentoring programs, than programs that provide a home for deserving elders. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this situation further with you. Should you have any questions please feel free to contact me via email or phone. The number is 252-792-8311. I appreciate your ,your time and attention to my Vintage Inn family.

Sincerely,

Becky B. Dymek

It's time for Time Warner to play ball:

The Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) is the local leader in live sports entertainment including 322 Major League Baseball games, NCAA basketball, football and lacrosse, and tons of local sports programming I can't get anywhere else.

My neighbors in North Carolina with DirecTV, Dish, Mediacom, MI Connections, Reds Cable, TriCounty or Charter already get MASN, but Time Warner Cable refuses to carry the network. 

That's because Time Warner Cable is blacking out MASN and preventing me - and thousands of other local sports fans - from watching our local sports network.  And because of my provider's baseball blackout, I cannot watch the Washington Nationals or Baltimore Orioles games, which have been televised for years.

It's time for Time Warner to play ball and carry MASN.

Sincerely,

	To Whom it may Concern:

	I know several people who receive help from DSS (Department of Social Services).
	These people like to do rent a kid. Basically they ask family or friends
	to split tax return with them and their kids become their family or friends dependents
	for the year. They receive help from DSS and on top of that they commit fraud by renting their kids
	as dependents to people on taxes. The DSS agency should make all receipts of help show a tax return
	and should be verified through a quick on line tax return check that it was filled with the IRS.

	This step would also help to catch Illegal immigrants who are receiving DSS help and to help keep
	tax fraud down which would help the state in the long run. One person I know who is guilty of renting
	her kids out is Tammy (Ezzell) Dillion. Tammy allows her mother Bonnie Ezzell of
	822 Stone Street, Haw River NC 27258, Bonnie phone 336-578-5065 to claim her kids as dependents on
	tax returns while DSS pays Tammy Housing, receives Medicaid, food stamps and other various
	help from DSS for her family while tammy and bonnie ezzell commit tax fraud so Tammy can get
	more money out of the Government and that her mother would not owe taxes to the irs. her Mother
	 If the IRS had wanted to do a serious AUDIT on Tammy and her Mother than they would
	 a) contact Alamance County DSS at 336-570-6570 and have them copy there records
	and submit them to do an audit on Bonnie Ezzell and Tammy Dillion. B) contact Alamance county school board and get
	all of Draco Dill ions school background to check which school he has attended and the address they used to
	get him into those schools (School Board of Alamance county phone # 336-570-6060).

	If the IRS had verified any documents that was sent to them and verified with DSS information they could prove
	easily that the above named people have committed tax fraud. With the age of computers anyone can do up
	documents from home and no one would be the wiser about it if they came from a school, dss or a persons home
	computer without verifying from the source the validation of such documents. DSS Graham Housing during some
	of these years paid for Tammy, Draco, and Kyra housing and a letter from them alone would prove tax fraud. If Irs
	would place a few calls and validate information instead of just assuming documents submitted are accurate and
	done by the agency and not on someone homes computer.

	Bonnie Ezzell is also guilty of cheating on her unemployment by working under the table at Cindy's Food Mart
	330 Roxboro St Haw River NC 27258 PHONE: 336-578-2924. This way she draws her full unemployment amount
	and still try to have extra money. Bonnie Ezzell believes she can cheat the system and get away with it.

Believe the IRS should bounce bonnies 5-7 yrs of tax records against 5-7 yrs of tammy DSS records and this will prove without a doubt they have commited tax fraud.

Comment: Gov. Perdue, thank you for signing the new law that will permit magistrates with a Right-to-Carry permit, and with some additional training, to carry concealed firearms into courthouses while on official business. I believe this represents a positive step by removing one of the arbitrary restrictions on where certain Right-to-Carry permit holders may carry firearms for personal protection. Thanks again for allowing magistrates to protect themselves and for not infringing their second amendment rights. Deb Sefton

	If you want this to stop and see reform to help reduce tax fraud please send a copy of this to the following
	your congressman, govenor and the president of the United States. All DSS receipts should have to
	follow the laws and should show proof they are doing what they are suppose to do and file a tax return
	And part of receiving help from dss should be showing proof you file taxes each year. The amount you file also
	would be used as a way to verify income for the year before for people receiving welfare and help fight fraud.
	Please forward this to as many people as you know so they too can pass this along.

Governor Bev Perdue
Office of the Governor
20301 Mail Service Center
Raleigh, NC 27699-0001

Dear Governor Perdue,

Fifty-four million Americans report being bullied at work --
that's 37 percent of the workforce.

Workplace bullying is a public epidemic that is easily
overlooked. It can include verbal abuse, offensive behaviors
that are intimidating or humiliating, and sabotage that
interferes with work.

The recession makes it harder to find a new job when bullying
gets out of hand. And working with a bully in the office can be
very taxing. Bullying is a form of psychological violence that
can cause stress, depression and even suicide.

I fully encourage you to enact legislation in our state that
will protect employees from bullying in the workplace.




Sincerely,
Nichols Malpass
2226 Harden Circle
Hendersonville, NC 28739

	To Whom it may Concern:

	I know several people who receive help from DSS (Department of Social Services).
	These people like to do rent a kid. Basically they ask family or friends
	to split tax return with them and their kids become their family or friends dependents
	for the year. They receive help from DSS and on top of that they commit fraud by renting their kids
	as dependents to people on taxes. The DSS agency should make all receipts of help show a tax return
	and should be verified through a quick on line tax return check that it was filled with the IRS.

	This step would also help to catch Illegal immigrants who are receiving DSS help and to help keep
	tax fraud down which would help the state in the long run. One person I know who is guilty of renting
	her kids out is Tammy (Ezzell) Dillion. Tammy allows her mother Bonnie Ezzell of
	822 Stone Street, Haw River NC 27258, Bonnie phone 336-578-5065 to claim her kids as dependents on
	tax returns while DSS pays Tammy Housing, receives Medicaid, food stamps and other various
	help from DSS for her family while tammy and bonnie ezzell commit tax fraud so Tammy can get
	more money out of the Government and that her mother would not owe taxes to the irs. her Mother
	If the IRS had wanted to do a serious AUDIT on Tammy and her Mother than they would
	a) contact Alamance County DSS at 336-570-6570 and have them copy there records
	and submit them to do an audit on Bonnie Ezzell and Tammy Dillion. B) contact Alamance county school board and get
	all of Draco Dill ions school background to check which school he has attended and the address they used to
	get him into those schools (School Board of Alamance county phone # 336-570-6060).

	If the IRS had verified any documents that was sent to them and verified with DSS information they could prove
	easily that the above named people have committed tax fraud. With the age of computers anyone can do up
	documents from home and no one would be the wiser about it if they came from a school, dss or a persons home
	computer without verifying from the source the validation of such documents. DSS Graham Housing during some
	of these years paid for Tammy, Draco, and Kyra housing and a letter from them alone would prove tax fraud. If Irs
	would place a few calls and validate information instead of just assuming documents submitted are accurate and
	done by the agency and not on someone homes computer.

Comment: Lynn Cauble P.O. Box 251 Ridgecrest, NC 28770-0251 September 16, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Governor Perdue: My husband and I urge you to vote against HR3200. We strongly oppose this bill due to the fact that we feel it gives the government to much control over the families in America. The right to raise children the way we see fit has always been a fundemental right in American history. This bill serves to take away some of those rights or at least control us more closely. Thank you for your time and attention to this important issue. Sincerely, Graham and Lynn Cauble

Vote No on this bill. Please look at the medical requirements that the Government is asking for. First, i believe it is a direct Hippa violation, because this will make it a public record. Second, People need to protect themselves, look at the Government gun control in Australia and why the wonder how the crime rate is climbing. Look at Germany when Hitler took guns away from the Jews they where slaughtered, they had no way to protect themselves. Just this last year a man here in the US was sent back to Germany for these very crimes. I say to you STOP and VOTE NO or our Constitution does not mean anything our fore fathers fought for.
