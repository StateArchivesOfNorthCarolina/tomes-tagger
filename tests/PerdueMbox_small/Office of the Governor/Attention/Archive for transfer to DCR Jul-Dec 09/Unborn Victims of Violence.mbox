Please support the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. This is by far the dumbest law i have ever heard of!!!!!!! Something needs to  be done! A baby is a human no matter what month week or day he/she is. Weather or not its born should not matter people say having abortions are wrong because its a human no matter what so why should it not count if the child is unborn and murdered?? Unbelievable!!!!! I would be very ahamed if i were u Leaders! God Bless everyone this has happen to!

Please support the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. I am not a resident of North Carolina, but I fully support any law that is for women. I especially support any law for unborn children. These unborn children are victims as well as their mother's & it is unnecissary acts of violence that our country need's to put a stop to & the only way we can is by asking for our lawmaker's to put these law's in effect, so these people who think it is okay to harm us women & unborn children will see there is no playing around. I feel ifa woman who is pregnant get's murdered then that should be 2 counts of murder, not just 1 as it has been. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME EVELYN CHRISTIANSEN

Please support the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. Unborn Victims of Violence will state the following:
AN ACT TO PROVIDE THAT A PERSON WHO commits the crime of murder or manslaughter OF A PREGNANT WOMAN is GUILTY OF A SEPARATE OFFENSE for THE RESULTING DEATH OF THE unborn child and to provide that a person who commits a felony or a misdemeanor that is an act of domestic violence and injures a pregnant woman that results in a miscarriage or stillbirth by the woman is guilty of a separate offense that is punishable at the same class and level as the underlying offense.
