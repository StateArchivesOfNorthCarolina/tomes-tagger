Subject: New Question!



Following is the question just received:



Visitor: Mr. Ryan Truelove



Address: 526 Stadium Drive, Boone, NC 28607



Email: ryan.truelove@us.army.mil



Subject: Citizen concerned on exemptions of the Food and Nutrition Services.



Comment: Dear Governor Purdue: I am composing this message to you in the hopes that it will come across your desk. My name is Ryan Truelove and I am a full-time student at Appalachian State University. I am also a combat veteran and a member of the US Army Reserve stationed at Ft. Bragg,  NC. On Friday, November 6th, 2009 I attempted to apply for Food and Nutrition Services at the Watauga county Department of Social Services. After I had painstakingly collected every document needed and extra supporting documentation, I was told I would be denied and I had to sign a piece of paper withdrawing my request. The reason for this is what concerns me. Because I am a full-time student and do not hold a work study position or have a part-time job working more than 20 hours a week, I am not eligible for food stamps. I live on a fixed income of $820.80 a month from the Department of Veteran's Affairs. This money is only sent while I am a full-time student and is prorated (by the day) when a full month of school is not scheduled. My bills greatly exceed my income and bankruptcy is may have to become an option in the near future. I receive full financial aid. When a student receives full financial aid, work study is automatically taken off their award letter because of the aid cap established. I have been looking for a part-time job in Boone, NC for the past 3 months. I cannot find one and this is why I was denied food services. I fear that I may reach a point where I may starve. I believe that I am more than deserving of this state and federal aid. I am a law-abiding citizen and have always paid my taxes. Is there a way for the State of North Carolina to make an exception? Thank you so much for your time and I am awaiting your reply. Sincerely, Ryan Truelove SPC US Army Reserve (910)8508091 ryan.truelove@us.army.mil, rt68897@appstate.edu
