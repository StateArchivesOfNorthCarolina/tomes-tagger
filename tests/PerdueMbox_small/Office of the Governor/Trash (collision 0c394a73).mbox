Subject: [Aid4Mail Trial tag #9382] Opposition to Purdue Beer Tax
Content-Type: text/plain;

Dear Governor Purdue:
¬†
I am writing to you today to voice my concern about (and vehement opposition to) the proposed 5% increase in taxes on alcohol in your recent budget proposal.
¬†
You state in your budget summary that "As families and businesses across our state are tightening their belts to make ends meet, government must do the same."¬† However, rather than tighten your belt to fit the budget realities, you have opted to give state government a raise on the backs of those of us who enjoy an occasional beer (and the brewers who make that beer).¬† Can you imagine the reaction of my employer if I were to demand a raise based on a behavior of my boss I didn't particularly approve of?¬† I would (rightfully) be laughed out of the room (if not fired outright).
¬†
The further claim that increasing so-called "sin" taxes is justified to "help offset healthcare costs associated with the use of tobacco products and alcohol" heaps insult upon injury.¬† As you are no doubt aware, scientific studies reaffirm the benefits of moderate alcohol use (in case you are¬†unaware, a handy review of the health benefits of moderate alcohol use can be found here: <http://www2.potsdam.edu/hansondj/alcoholandhealth.html>http://www2.potsdam.edu/hansondj/alcoholandhealth.html).¬† No such claim can be made on behalf of cigarettes, and to lump them together as equal contributors to increased health care costs is to pretend that any user of alcohol is an abuser of alcohol.¬†
¬†
I know pulling an extra $500 million dollars in tax revenue into the state's bucket has to be tempting to any politician (especially when incomes are down so the state's income tax revenue has dropped), but please take a moment to consider what it means for a moderate user of alcohol, for example, someone who drinks one beer nightly with his or her dinner and enjoys the health benefits that result from such moderate use of alcohol.
¬†
One of my personal favorite beers is brewed right here in North Carolina by Highland Breweries.¬† It currently sells for $8.99 a six pack at my local Harris Teeter.¬† Now, admittedly,¬†$8.99 is on the high end for a six pack, but¬†goodness grows in North Carolina, so I think it's worth it.¬† Thanks to your tax increase, that six pack will cost me an extra $.45.¬† Over the course of a year, that's over $23 (for the sake of easy math, I've presumed I drink one a night, but¬†skip Sundays in a nod to the old "blue laws").
¬†
Sure, as you said in your press conference, "those of us who choose to use those two products can afford to suck it up."¬† I can also choose to buy a cheaper beer that's not from NC.¬† Heck, I live in south Charlotte a mere hop, skip and a jump from the state line, so I can choose not to buy any alcohol in NC at all (don't worry, I'll stay under the legal transport limits).¬† But those choices aren't exactly what you had in mind when you mentioned choices, I'm sure.¬†Because those choices, when taken by any significant number of people, would kill several good North Carolina companies that brew wonderful beers, and inflate the South Carolina treasuries at the expense of our own.
¬†
Additionally, beer taxes are a regressive tax, placing a higher burden on those who can afford¬†it least and North Carolina already has one of the most burdensome¬†beer taxes in the entire country (<http://projects.newsobserver.com/under_the_dome/n_c_has_fourth_highest_beer_tax>http://projects.newsobserver.com/under_the_dome/n_c_has_fourth_highest_beer_tax).¬†
¬†
I urge you to reconsider compounding this already unfair tax burden in the face of the economic crisis we face (and to certainly not use that crisis as an excuse to ply your tax increase).¬† North Carolina citizens and North Carolina beer drinkers deserve better and are paying attention.

Thank you for your consideration,

Governor Purdue,

I†was very disappointed in your†proposed budget as it relates to State Employees.† I have been a state employee for 3 years and love my job.† I did not expect to get an increase this year and thought there†would not even be a slim chance for one next year.† However, I did feel that I would at least be offered some bonus time.† I was†surprised that nothing was offered to those of us who have not reached longevity service with the state.

Now I do understand that bonus time is a debt on the state financials due to the fact that most employees do not use their bonus time, and should they leave employment with the state down the road, the payout of bonus time is at the rate of pay when they leave the state.† So why not put a "use it or lose it" stipulation on the bonus time?† State that employees must use the bonus time within one or two years.† Since no increases†have been set aside in your budget for employees for the next two years, that would not add debt to the state.† As much difficulty as you have keeping state employees or attracting younger workers, this seems like a fair compromise.

I urge you to please fight for the interest of state employees.† We are a dedicated group of workers and feel that we deserve a little more consideration than we currently receive.† I would also appreciate a response as to why offering bonus time with a stipulation that it must be used within a 1 or 2 year period would or would not be possible.† Thank you for your consideration.


Sincerely,
Jane Schairer

Accessibility Code Battle

Some of our members may have recently seen a communication from the North Carolina Building Inspectors Association (NCBIA) advocating for the passage of HB 610 and SB 607, bills that would disallow the adoption of IBC Chapter 11 as our state Accessibility Code. With our partners from the United Spinal Association we've prepared a line by line response to the NCBIA's assessment of the accessibility code controversy. <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1102522713168&e=001FWbXHCYxCir4RtyuuES5Gtu8_6VLaIBnyckmM2bWtbkptiTXKnIgfSmF0vL_hl3bjQXO6o_waIMSAdlCqg1C7X4v1c-Ol1jnZZf2fUvzxBmt-2dlhsGwJDLMS9iUhyjvdtTgRzi98pp87qt61PuAd7PLt74eLKPxs4qx0sJ8Q14=>Click here to view the whole document.

Dear Governor Purdue,

We would like to express our deepest concern about the†proposed 5% sales tax increase on wine.

Our names are Sandon and Amy Dennis, owners/operators of Dennis Vineyards Winery located in Albemarle, NC.† As one of the 85 wineries and 400 vineyards in the state, we feel that a 5% tax increase on wine would be disastrous on our industry.† Not just the wineries of NC but the wine shops, restaurants, and other businesses serving the wine industry in our state.

In the past year, we have noticed a substantial decline in sales. At a time when consumersí budgets are already tight, we feel that a 5% tax increase on wine would just make the situation even worse, thus hurting our industry which contributes to the state in so many ways.† Any tax increase could lead to business closings and job losses in our industry which employs 5,700 people across the state.

On behalf of†Dennis Vineyards†Winery, our employees, our grape growers, our wine†retailers, our†suppliers of winery equipment, and all small businesses that depend on the continued growth and success of the North Carolina wine industry,†PLEASE reconsider and eliminate your proposed 5% tax on wine.

We appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely yours,

Sandon and Amy Dennis

I do not agree with the recent some $53 million supposedly being passed on to the taxpayer to shore up the state employee health insurance - maybe the out of state mail order program should have been considered more seriously if it in fact would have been that much savings.

One other issue that concerns me - the possible opening of ABC stores on Sundays - granted none of us keep the Sabbath as once was done and this would generate some extra much needed revenue but still DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO IT!

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION.

RE:

State employees medical insurance and tax - I feel strongly that these folks should share the pain we're all feeling - even a minimal amount toward their medical insurance would help - I paid some $500 per mo. through my employer before going on medicare and my sister is paying some $600 per mo. through her employer - incidentally, our mother taught school† in NC some 30 years, and I have all due respect for educators as well as other state workers.† As far as taxes, we're all, including the state employees, reaping the benefits of those taxes.

Tobacco and Alcohol taxes - I strongly support increases for these as they are not necessities and many people are having to struggle to buy food.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration in these matters.

Governor Persdue

IFirst of all, let me say that I enjoy your website telling the public about things that are happening in government.† Second, let me let off a little steam about the tax on tobacco products and liquor.† I was raised thinking this was THE TOBACCO STATE.† Now, to put such a tax on tobacco products sounds a† bit rediculous and the small amount that went on liquor products.† Please know that I am NOT a SMOKER† nor a DRINKER, but just do not understand these taxes.† We all know that cigarettes cause cancer,and takes lives, but look how many people are killed from drinking alcoholic products.† Don't you think if the taxes were higher on alcohol that fewer people would die on our highways?

I know that this might be a minor concern now with the economic conditions the way they are, but I just had to voice my opinion on this subject.

Thank you for taking the time to read† this e-mail.

Governor Breaks Ground on First Economic Recovery Highway Project

Gov. Bev Perdue was joined by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and†local elected officials in Camden County at a groundbreaking on Thursday†for one of North Carolinaís first highway improvement projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The event was held at the George M. Wood Memorial Park on U.S. 158 in Camden County near the Camden/Pasquotank County line.

The $6.1 million project will widen a congested 2.4-mile stretch of U.S. 158 from east of the Pasquotank River to north of Havenwood Drive in Elizabeth City from two to four lanes. The highway is known locally as the Camden Causeway and serves as the main link between Elizabeth City and Camden and Currituck counties.

ìThis recovery project will make a significant contribution to Camden County and this region now and in the future,î Perdue said.† ìIt will quickly put people to work and have a significant economic impact.† Improving U.S. 158 helps northeastern North Carolina prepare for future growth and ensures this region is ready when new opportunities arise.î

The U.S. 158 widening project is one of 11 economic recovery projects awarded to contract in March. The projects are located in Alamance, Brunswick, Camden, Currituck, Forsyth/Stokes, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Scotland and Stanly counties.† It is also one of the $466 million first phase recovery infrastructure projects that are expected to create and sustain 14,000 jobs across the state.

NCOpenBook.gov goes live

This week Governor Perdue†launched the first wave of <http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov, a government transparency website for searching state contracts and grants.† Gov. Perdue signed Executive Order No. 4 on January 12, her first day in office, ordering the creation of NC OpenBook.

ìIn the 21st century online accessibility and transparency should be the standard for public information,î Perdue said.† ìWeíre going to let the sun shine in on state contracts.î

<http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov provides a database of approximately 2,500 state contracts and 5,000 grants that are now available in a searchable format.† The Office of State Budget and Management is working with state agencies and departments to streamline their contract databases so that North Carolina will have a comprehensive searchable database online this year on NC OpenBook.gov.

In addition to state contracts and grants, <http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov will feature detailed information about state agency performance measures and planning as outlined in Executive Order No. 3.


Governor Bev Perdue leads White House Forum on Health Care Reform

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue hosted one of five regional White House Forums on Health Care Reform.††She stressed the benefits†that lowering health care costs would have on businesses and government while trying to create jobs in the midst of economic crisis.† She also highlighted North Carolina solutions like Community Care that could work nationally.

In case you missed it, Rebecca Adelman of the US Department of Health and Human Services <http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/03/31/Regional-Health-Forum-Greensboro-Streamed-and-Live-blogged-at-1030/>live blogged the event.† You can also see a <http://healthreform.gov/slideshows/whforum_nc.html>photo gallery here.


Governor Hosts Education Town Hall Meeting in Wilmington

On Wednesday, Governor Perdue hosted a town hall meeting at Cape Fear Community College in Wilmington.† Joining Governor Perdue were State Schools CEO Bill Harrison and Community College President Scott Ralls.† A packed and lively crowd of 300 citizens†asked questions and discussed education and workforce development issues with Governor Perdue, Harrison and Ralls.


Governor†Perdue on the†Stateís Motion to Intervene in Alcoaís Yadkin River Hydroelectric Dam Relicensing

Gov. Bev Perdue†this week†announced North Carolinaís Attorney General has, at her request, filed a petition with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to be allowed to participate in proceedings regarding the relicensing†of a hydroelectric dam project on the Yadkin River.† Gov. Perdue is asking the commission to consider rededicating the public resource -- the river and the power generated by the dam ñ to public use that would serve the citizens and help North Carolinaís economy.

ìThe waters of the Yadkin River belong to the people of North Carolina.† Fifty years ago, we endorsed Alcoaís request for a federal license to operate hydroelectric dams on the river because they powered the companyís aluminum smelting works.† That facility was a linchpin in the regional economy and created jobs for up to 1000 North Carolina workers.î† said Gov. Perdue. ìToday the smelter and the jobs are gone ñ and so is the reason for the license.† Iím asking FERC to enable the recapture of the license so it can be used once† again to help create jobs and economic opportunity for the region.î


Governor Signs Legislation Authorizing Grandfather Mountain State Park

On Tuesday, Gov. Bev Perdue signed legislation formally authorizing Grandfather Mountain as the stateís newest state park.

An agreement for the state to purchase the undeveloped, backcountry portion of Grandfather Mountain was announced in September. Funding for the $12 million acquisition will come equally from the Parks and Recreation and Natural Heritage trust funds. Grandfather Mountain State Park will be comprised of these 2,456 acres, which the state will purchase from the Morton family later this spring.

ìThe creation of a signature state park at Grandfather Mountain is a big step in adding to the quality of life and beauty of our great state while we also preserve North Carolinaís spectacular public lands for future generations,î said Gov. Perdue.† ìThanks to the Morton family and our conservation partners, visitors from inside and outside of North Carolina will be able to enjoy the majesty of this wonderful mountain for generations to come.î

House and Senate authorization bills had 48 co-sponsoring legislators. The primary sponsor of Senate Bill 89 was Sen. Joe Sam Queen, of Haywood County. Primary sponsors of House Bill 128 were Reps. Phillip Frye of Mitchell County, Edgar Starnes of Caldwell County, and Cullie Tarleton of Watauga County.

The heirs of company founder Hugh Morton will continue to operate the travel destination with its nature center, wildlife habitats and ìmile-highî swinging bridge on a paid admission basis. The acquisition agreement gives the state a conservation easement on 749 acres of the original property where the attraction is located. The state parks system is coordinating an interim management plan with the Morton family for the backcountry property and its 12 miles of trails.

The acquisition was arranged in 2008 with the help of The Conservation Fund and one of its directors, Mike Leonard, and The Nature Conservancy, which holds conservation easements on the mountain and surrounding properties totaling close to 4,000 acres. The property lies in Watauga, Avery and Caldwell counties, and contains the headwaters of both the Watauga and Linville rivers. Developed as an attraction by Hugh Morton in the 1950s, it boasts 73 rare species and is distinguished by the 5,946-foot Calloway Peak.


On-Site Accountability Visit to Pasquotank Correctional Institute

On Thursday, Gov. Bev Perdue made an unannounced visit to the Pasquotank Correctional Institute in Elizabeth City.† During her 45-minute visit, she was shown the close custody section of the prison, the vocational unit, and she spoke at length with prison staff members.††

ìMy visit to Pasquotank Correctional Institute gave me the opportunity to see first hand the work our correctional officers and other staff do to protect the publicís safety.† This is one area, like all the segments of our public safety system, in which nothing less than the highest standards must be maintained,î said Perdue.††

The visit was a follow up on Gov. Perdueís pledge to make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies across North Carolina.†


Governor Perdue, State Experts Join Fight Against Chronic Disease

Gov. Bev Perdue announced†on Friday†that North Carolina will become one of the largest states to join the <http://www.fightchronicdisease.org/>Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease (PFCD).

ìMy goal is for North Carolina to be a national leader in health care,î said Perdue during a kick off event at the East Carolina Heart Institute in Greenville. ìCracking down on chronic disease will save lives, it will lessen the heavy burden of medical costs that many families face, and it will reduce health care expenses for our state.î

As national policy-makers consider new approaches to health care, PFCD amplifies the voices of individual states concerned about the millions of lives and billions of dollars lost to chronic disease.† a state level, PFCD brings together dozens of leading health care organizations (39 and counting) to share best practices and new ideas.†

Speaking alongside Gov. Perdue, Dr. Paul R.G. Cunningham, dean of the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University and co-chair of the NC PFCD, said, "To truly address the health care of every North Carolinian and American, comprehensive reform must go beyond providing better coverage.† It also must address chronic disease, the number one driver of health problems in our nation."

Cancer, heart disease, asthma, obesity and other chronic diseases claim 1.7 million American lives per year and cost more than $1.5 trillion. The toll on North Carolina is also devastating, and threatens to get worse.†


Operation Slow Down

Monday, Gov. Bev Perdue announced†that the N.C. State Highway Patrol and the Governorís Highway Safety Program†were kicking off Operation Slow Down/No Need 2 Speed to catch speeders on North Carolinaís highways. Local law enforcement agencies will join troopers from now through April 12 to encourage drivers to slow down and follow the speed limit.

ìNorth Carolina law enforcement will be going after speeders who recklessly endanger our citizens,î said Perdue. ìSpeed is the leading cause of crashes on our highways. I urge motorists to slow down and obey the speed limit. î

Last year 1,405 people were killed in traffic crashes on North Carolina highways; speed was the leading cause of those crashes.† Stepped-up enforcement will be conducted across the state, focusing on motorists speeding.

Dangerous driving can be reported to the Highway Patrol by dialing *HP on cellular phones from anywhere in the state. For more information about Operation Slow Down 2009, visit the N.C. Department of Crime Control and Public Safetyís Web site at <http://www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp>www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp.

Howdy Honorable Gov. Bev perdue,

†† Well, It looks like I made a big mistake voting for you! I pray to God that He will forgive me! You want to bite the hand that has fed you.

Governor Breaks Ground on First Economic Recovery Highway Project

Gov. Bev Perdue was joined by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and†local elected officials in Camden County at a groundbreaking on Thursday†for one of North Carolina‚Äôs first highway improvement projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The event was held at the George M. Wood Memorial Park on U.S. 158 in Camden County near the Camden/Pasquotank County line.

The $6.1 million project will widen a congested 2.4-mile stretch of U.S. 158 from east of the Pasquotank River to north of Havenwood Drive in Elizabeth City from two to four lanes. The highway is known locally as the Camden Causeway and serves as the main link between Elizabeth City and Camden and Currituck counties.

‚ÄúThis recovery project will make a significant contribution to Camden County and this region now and in the future,‚Äù Perdue said.† ‚ÄúIt will quickly put people to work and have a significant economic impact.† Improving U.S. 158 helps northeastern North Carolina prepare for future growth and ensures this region is ready when new opportunities arise.‚Äù

The U.S. 158 widening project is one of 11 economic recovery projects awarded to contract in March. The projects are located in Alamance, Brunswick, Camden, Currituck, Forsyth/Stokes, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Scotland and Stanly counties.† It is also one of the $466 million first phase recovery infrastructure projects that are expected to create and sustain 14,000 jobs across the state.

NCOpenBook.gov goes live

This week Governor Perdue†launched the first wave of <http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov, a government transparency website for searching state contracts and grants.† Gov. Perdue signed Executive Order No. 4 on January 12, her first day in office, ordering the creation of NC OpenBook.

‚ÄúIn the 21st century online accessibility and transparency should be the standard for public information,‚Äù Perdue said.† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to let the sun shine in on state contracts.‚Äù

<http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov provides a database of approximately 2,500 state contracts and 5,000 grants that are now available in a searchable format.† The Office of State Budget and Management is working with state agencies and departments to streamline their contract databases so that North Carolina will have a comprehensive searchable database online this year on NC OpenBook.gov.

In addition to state contracts and grants, <http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov will feature detailed information about state agency performance measures and planning as outlined in Executive Order No. 3.


Governor Bev Perdue leads White House Forum on Health Care Reform

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue hosted one of five regional White House Forums on Health Care Reform.††She stressed the benefits†that lowering health care costs would have on businesses and government while trying to create jobs in the midst of economic crisis.† She also highlighted North Carolina solutions like Community Care that could work nationally.

Dear Governor Perude, 

I am writing to you to ask your support in blocking a proposal in the current budget appropriations bill to repeal the full tuition grant for graduates of the North Carolina School of Science and Math (NCSSM) who attend a state university. This proposal is found in Section 9.7.(a) and states that ‚ÄúEffective July 1, 2009, tuition grants for graduates of the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics will be phased out. No new recipients shall be funded after June 30, 2009.‚Äù 

I am an active-duty Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Marine Corps, a veteran of twenty-one years of service, a recent returnee from one year in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and a North Carolinian. As much as anyone, I am acutely aware of the budgetary challenges facing all government agencies at the federal, state, and local levels. However, I also realize that although budget cycles will come and go, people are our most important resource, and that failing to invest adequately in professional education is a false economy. 

NCSSM attracts the best and brightest young people in North Carolina. There are many reasons why children would want to leave their homes two years early, and that parents allow it. The education is second to none, no doubt, but it comes at a price. Many children, for example, sacrifice the opportunity to be valedictorian of their local high school in order to attend NCSSM, which has no class standing. Most students would undoubtedly have ‚ÄúStraight A‚Äôs‚Äù in their local school- but forsake a perfect transcript for ‚ÄúA‚Äôs and B‚Äôs‚Äù at NCSSM in recognition of the higher quality of education available by attending.

It seems inexplicable to me that the State of North Carolina, having invested over $25,000 per student while at NCSSM, would fail to make the next step to retain that talent and attempt to keep it in the state. No doubt, some students will stay in-state regardless; however I can assure you from my conversations with my daughter and her friends, the failure of the legislature to incentivize staying in-state through the tuition grant will result in a mass migration of NCSSM graduates to the many out-of-state institutions who recruit aggressively within the school. As someone who deals with personnel issues and retention bonuses on a nearly daily basis, I can assure you that the money spent to keep these children in-state is a bargain compared to what it will take to lure them away from other prestigious education institutions, or the cost of losing them altogether. When the cure for cancer or AIDS is finally found, we want it to happen at UNC-Chapel Hill
 or NC State; not Harvard or Johns Hopkins. 		 

At a minimum, those students currently enrolled as juniors and seniors at NCSSM should be ‚Äúgrandfathered‚Äù to enable them to retain the tuition grant. These children were promised something when they enrolled: it is unconscionable to change the rules in the middle of the game; especially for this year‚Äôs seniors who have made enrollment and scholarship decisions based on what the legislature promised them. A retroactive withdrawal would be unjust: many NCSSM students did not apply - for example- for the Morehead or Park scholarships, on the promise of the tuition grant. In future years, many non-NCSSM students will be in direct competition with NCSSM students for the same scholarships. At the very least, if the law must be changed, let future enrollees make their decisions on the basis of the availability or non-availability of the grant. Please do not punish the current students for a financial crisis they did not create.

I thank you in advance on behalf of these children. I am confident that, with your help, cooler heads will prevail and ultimately, we will keep the faith with these fine students. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you wish to discuss this matter further with me.

Sincerely,

Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Pollard USMC

Dear Gov. Perdue:

The Senate Appropriations bill related to our state pre-k program is devastating.† Not only is it cutting $40 million by requiring reduced slot payments, combining it with child care will gut the quality provisions of the program.† We already started a pilot "plus-type" program with the†Divison of Chlld Develment a couple of years ago when I headed up OSR, and the regulatory consultants are not trained to understand or monitor quality pre-k programs.† That level of training is not required for the work they do in child care licensing.† The other provisions are equally devastating.†

I am sure there will be other provisions for pre-K with the use of the lottery funds, but we have now split up what was one of the top 2 quality pre-k programs in the country. I am willing to consider changes in MAF if truly needed.† But†if we ever hope to reduce the achievement gap, it will start by quality investments at young ages, not continuing to fund high dollar stop-gap measures in later school years.†

As a strong supporter for you during the campaign and now - in part because you seemed to understand the critical importance of this type of program for young children, I hope that you will take a strong stand to maintain the integrity of an integrated pre-k program (across all funding sources)†and its strong connection to education.† It cannot simply be a high level child care program and make a difference in the lives of children.

Thank you.

Dear North Carolina State Representatives and Governor Purdue,†
I am writing to address my concern over the recent budget proposal for the 2010-2011 year. †My concern lies within the appropriation of funds for the North Carolina Governor's School program (section 6 in the "Public Schools" section). †This indicates that in light of the state's current budget shortfall, there are plans in the works to cut Governor's School in half. †This would cause the Governor's School program to essentially cut in half and return it to a single campus with only 400 students, such as it was prior to 1978. †Cutting the GS budget is exactly the wrong thing for the state to do. Our current economic crisis is a serious issue for our nation and our state. But the answer to that challenge is not to contract, but to arm ourselves with the knowledge, skills, and education we need to meet the challenges of our times. There is a national call to make progress in the areas of alternative energy, combating global climate change, improving education, and making health care more affordable. These and many other initiatives will strengthen our economy, both nationally and here in North Carolina.†
The Governor's School program is designed to give our state's best, brightest, artistic, and most energetic young people the skills and knowledge they will need to rise to these challenges and lead us into our bright future. So it is unbelievable to me that the state would seek to curtail the program that is part of our best hope for solving the problems that plague us today. †The NC Governor's school program was the first of its kind in the nation and remains a model for these types of programs. †I know many people across the state who attended the program, and claim it to be a cornerstone in their development as responsible and knowledgeable citizens.†I do acknowledge that this appropriation is nonrecurring, which would hopefully return the budget to its previous amount the following year. †It is my belief, however, that once the infrastructure to support two campuses has been dismantled, the chance of it staying permanently dismantled is fairly high.†
Additionally, as a†constituent†of district 27, I would like to thank representative Vaughn for the support of senate bill 66 for the requirements of art education in high school. †I hope you will consider maintaining the budget for the North Carolina Governor's School program. †Let us keep education a top priority in these hard times.
Thank You,

My name is Marty McGuinn I am the Fire Chief at Sunny View Fire & Rescue in Polk County. I am contacting you about an issue that could effect the fire service across the state but specially western N.C. It most certainly will effect my department and Polk county.††
It is my understanding that funding for†NC Forestry† bridge crew program has been completely cut from the budget. This is of great concern to all the volunteer fire departments across the state. Here in Polk County and all across western NC we rely heavily on these bridge crews. I don't kow if you are familiar with the program but it is a program that uses youth offenders that receive training in wildland fire suppression under forestry supervision to provide needed crews and manpower to support fire operations. These crews help establish fire lines and extinguish fires, they stay on the scene after the flames have been extinguished to clear out any remaining hot spots that could flare back up and rekindle the fires. These crews relieve volunteer fire fighters that have been initial attack units and allow them to be returned into service to provide other services. The fire departments main priority is structure protection the woods are secondary. The bridge crews primary function is the woods and thats their area of training. I was told these crews work for $1 a day and I know we can't get it done any cheaper. If the bridge crew program is not funded and no longer exist it puts the burdens of these job on the volunteer fire departments. This will mean longer hours on fires and larger land and property loss. My department is already stretched to its limits with new federal and state regulations and I am afraid the increased demand on my department will cause more people to not volunteer and of the ones that do volunteer I am afraid some will get injuried due to the lack of manpower on calls. Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter and I apologize for the length of this email.

Sincerely

Chief Marty L McGuinn
Sunny View Fire & Rescue
Polk Co

Dear Governor Perdue,



As a longtime Apprenticeship Program sponsor and supporter, we are strongly opposed to the program being done away with as part of the state's new budget changes.



We continue to have a successful HVAC Apprenticeship Program that has graduated over 50 apprentices in 13 year's time.† We feel the program is critical to the education and career advancement of the HVAC trade, which is severely lacking skilled workers.



Please do not remove the Apprenticeship Program from the state budget.



Sincerely,

Hello Governor...
My name is Ron Wyatt and my daughter is Hannah Wyatt...attached is my†dughter's (Hannah) NCSSM announcement that ran in all of our area papers to put her face behind†her name.†

Anyhow, there is a bill that is being sponsored††by Senators Garrou, Albertson, Dannelly & Swindell, Section 9.7(a), Repeal of Full NCSSM (North Carolina School of Science & Math) Tuition Grant that will greatly impact my daughter and my family financially.† This bill is tremendously unfair as many of our Seniors at NCSSM†have already declined college†scholarships and other awards†that they were offered this year, based on the fact that they did expect the tuition grant and were planning to attend one of the UNC System's Universities.††My daughter†is a†junior this year at NCSSM and am proud to say that†she is†one of the brightest young minds at her age†in this state and she too took a leap of faith to attend NCSSM with the trade-off being the promise of the tuition grant to one of the UNC†system†universities after she graduates from NCSSM in 2010.††

Hannah would have attended Ledford High School (Thomasville, NC)†this year and next...she held the number one ranking in her class her Freshman and Sophomore years and most likely could have graduated with that number one ranking and would have been the valedictorian of her senior class of 300 plus students.† However, she chose to sacrifice that opportunity to better herself with more challenging curriculum at NC School of Science & Math and with the promise she would be rewarded with a tuition grant to one of the UNC System†Colleges of her choice upon acceptance and high school graduation from NCSSM in 2010.† Now we are being told that there is a great possibility that our state will be reneging on that promise and my daughter will get no tuition grant for the sacrifice she has made.† Besides her sacrifice,†my wife and I have sacrificed greatly by encouraging her with being challenged academically by accepting her leaving home at an early age to attend NCSSM in Durham, NC.† We†supported her decision to attend NCSSM to meet†a high scholastic†challenge†and we gave up watching our daughter grow up her last two years in high school and getting to be a part of all the†social stuff parents get to experience during their child's high school years by allowing her to attend NCSSM†with the promise the UNC System†tuition grant reward would be there in the end as the trade-off.

Governor,†my wife and I are simple Davidson County folk..a middle income family...in fact, I lost my job with a company layoff†several weeks ago†(the 3rd time I've lost a job†in†4 years) and just recently have become employed again and am picking up the pieces on the financial side of things.† My daughter gave up her opportunity of academic glory at Ledford High School and the many scholarship opportunities that would have resulted from staying at Ledford†to be more challenged academically at NCSSM and for the tuition grant. It appears she could be stuck without†a promise kept†as a result of the aforementioned bill if it passes. Unfortunately, Hannah†will not be able to go back to Ledford 9her former high school)†with the re-established #1 class ranking and a lot of her classes (course of study) at NCSSM†will not transfer back to Ledford as†NCSSM's curriculum is so†much different than a public high school.† Governor, please do not†let my daughter get left high and dry...please do nto support this bill...keep the tuition grant for those students who are currently attending†NCSSM (class of 2009 and 2010).†

Please do not let the state break their promise to our family...our daughter who was counting on it.† She†made the sacrifice by acting on faith and her dreams and on this tuition grant†promise.††Hannah could quite possibly be the next female†governor of NC and don't let the message be sent to her†that our state is not willing to live up to their promise of its educational investment in her.

Governor, please consider that the†three main reasons that the NCSSM Tuition Grant should stay in place:


∑†††††† Based on the promise of this academic award, most of our senior families made decisions to attend UNC institutions prior to the release this budget proposal. In many cases, they declined scholarships elsewhere. For these families, especially, it is too late to make alternate plans and avoid serious financial harm.

∑†††††† Both junior and senior families have made important personal,†educational and financial decisions based upon this compact, which has served as an incentive for academic achievement since their middle school years.

∑†††††† The tuition grant is symbolic of the importance placed by North Carolinians on educational excellence.† These young people attending this school are the brightest of the brightest who are†our†future NC business, educational and government leaders.

I ask you again to†please don't let a promise†be broken to our†NCSSM 2009 and 2010 classes...to my daughter,†Hannah. It would be†a travesty to rescind on this tuition grant promise†by†back dooring/blind siding our†children and us parents after making a firm commitment to us...we all have†sacrificed†so much†on the state's promise that should be kept.†

I am placing my faith in you to do the right thing and hoping you will rally others in the legislature†to do the same by voting to keep the NCSSM tuition grant in place by NOT supporting the bill†sponsored†by Senators Garrou, Albertson, Dannelly & Swindell, Section 9.7(a), Repeal of Full NCSSM.

Sincerely,

Ron Wyatt

Governor Perdue,

I am writing today regarding your most recent press release of† directives†for additional Government Restrictions.† As a contractor that provides goods and services to the State we desperately need some clarification.† While we too are in desperate times of economic concern we will hold onto our obligations and integrity with our Vendors and Customers. It is my hopes that the State will do the same.

Today we have received multiple calls from Agencies across the State wanting to cancel orders and mandate that if goods are not delivered, installed and invoiced†by April 16, 2009 that the State will not honor their Purchase Orders.† While we understand the directive and appreciate the State's commitment to Budget Constraints we believe that the understanding of Vendors process was not given thorough thought.† When we receive an order from the State we process with our own purchase order to our Vendors.† When our orders are entered into our manufacturing Vendors production schedules these orders cannot be canceled.† As you can appreciate these items are being made specifically for our customer in their colors and required sizes.† Thus this is why we must order the item instead of taking it from our stock.†

While we†understand the directive†advising no more orders after April 16, 2009, we adamantly disagree with not accepting and paying for what the State has committed to a Purchase Order.† We will be unable to cancel these orders with our factories, thus we will have to take delivery and pay for these goods.† It is unreasonable for the State to further burden it's North Carolina Vendors with this type action. Could you please follow up with me as to what we may do together to have the State's offices receive and pay for these goods that were committed to Purchase Orders before April 16, 2009?

Thank you in advance for your quick response.

Sincerely,

Bill Crawley

YOU MUST PUT A STOP TO SPENDING MONEY THAT WE DONT HAVE.\

Its called belt tightening which we the taxpayers are very used to,it's about time our elected officials practiced the
same regarding the State budget.

Honorable Legislators,

As I was reviewing SB 287 which is scheduled to be voted on today by the NCGA, I will be very happy to serve on the Task Force cited in the Bill. Also, after reviewing this Bill and other laws which have gone into effect over the years, intelligence from a Task Force, pilot programs, best practices from other states/municipalities, etc., or a combination will be extremely helpful when crafting any Bill of this magnitude. The points I have made and am making may have been considered before the laws went into effect. However, your pending votes that will decide the outcome caused me to remember the last words my top two bosses told me many years ago after I was assigned a major project that was on the verge of sinking the whole program. They were: "Larry, whatever decisions you make, you cannot afford to be wrong."

I do not put SB 287 at the aforementioned level, but IMHO it is a Bill, as written, that gives away too much State leverage and benefits. Again, I will urge you to vote to amend this Bill for the State workers', retirees' and taxpayers' benefits or vote it down.

Respectfully,† †

Larry Dickens

However, IMHO, what is a more equitable and progressive scale for sharing the ‚Äúpain‚Äù is as follows or some close variation. In the recommended scenario below, no one loses his or her job either. In fact, it may free up some money for education, law enforcement, mental health, transit,† rainy day fund, etc. and provide sufficient funding for the fiscal year with significantly less pain. Please see my thoughts below:
> 
> †

> 1.††††††† Go back to the dates that Governors Easley and Perdue gave directives for budgets to be cut 4%, then 6%† (additional 2%) and then 9% (additional 3%) because of the deteriorating economy (above percentages are examples only and may not be accurate); determine the cuts but also any approved/unapproved salary, in-range, bonuses, etc. increases during these same time frames.†

> 2.††††††† Once the ‚Äúpluses and minuses‚Äù are added up, determine the net authorized and unauthorized expenditures consistent with the Governors‚Äô directives and the associated dates - - especially in the areas of salaries, in-range increases, bonuses, etc. Then do what has been proposed for Wall St CEOs but a modified version of the ‚Äúclaw-back‚Äù, i.e., cancel the unauthorized increases going forward. That action should put that money back into the Budget for operating expenditures.

> 3.††††††† Analyze what percentage of the budget is composed of salaries. Analyze various salary ranges by quartiles, by percentage breaks or what gives the best evaluation model. The foundation of this plan should be built on the higher the salary, the greater the percentage cut. Not having done the study, but one inherent rule coming from the research could be that no one making less than †- - say $50,000 per year will be subject to a salary cut. From 1 and 2 above, run the algorithms and an implementation plan for cuts leading to savings could look like the following: 16% for $500,000-above, 14% for $450,000-400,001, 12% for $400,000-350,001, 10% for $350,000-300,001, 8% for $300,000-250,001, 6% for $250,000-200,001, 5% for $200,000-150,001, 4% for $150,000-125,001, 3% for $125,000-100,001, 2% for $100,000-75,001, 1% for $75,000-50,001 and 0% for $50,000 and below.

> †

> Also, what the above analysis and evaluation will do is to provide the Governor and the NCGA information and data of how well or not so well the Governors‚Äô directives were implemented. With IT capability today, these findings and implementation of a sound budget for all state employees, taxpayers and North Carolina citizens can be implemented. Unlike many private companies, state services to the public and tax-paying citizens must continue through downturns or other disruptions.

> †

> Recently, I was watching an interview that Joseph Stiglitz, 2001 Nobel Prize Winner for Economics,† was doing with a reporter, and he commented on some actions Congress and the Obama Administration are doing to bring the economy back.† A point he repeated multiple times was to ensure that sufficient funding was provided for the unemployed because they will put the money immediately back into the economy. The same result is true with the broader, low-to-middle end salaried employees, too. Keeping all employees employed will put even more money back into the economy.

As a purchasing professional with extensive training and experience†in buying, negotiating, managing buyers and people management - - in private industry and state government - - there are options that can still be executed on behalf of state workers, retirees and taxpayers.
> 
> I have not seen the contract; however, in general, a customer/state should never, ever enter into a sole source contract unless there are extraordinary circumstances. Some extraordinary circumstances may be insufficient time to seek competitive bids, not well-defined specifications/requirements, no known competition, etc. Whenever a customer enters into a single source contract, it loses the "strong" hand of receiving a better price for services than what is offered - - which translates into customer losses instead of customer savings. Even if a single source contract is the last resort, the customer should continually test the market for competitive sources. However, in this case, competition is already available.
> 
> Now, having said the above and assuming that April, 2009 is the "drop dead" date for having a contract in place, there are still options that legislators can initiate to get better prices and services for state workers and retirees in the State Health Plan. I have listed some below. By the way, even if an "official start date" of a new contract is July 1, 2009, binding language to the effect of "continual, uninterrupted coverage up to 90 days after the contract official end date shall be provided if the customer executes this option at least 60 days prior to the official contract expiration date (June 30)" should be included in any new contract. (Vehicle insurance has a 30-day grace period built into the contracts.) I assume, either party may cancel the contract and accept associated costs, liabilities, penalties, etc. consistent with mutually agreed to notification language in the contract. Also, I assume that the four elements of a solid contract is included in the existing one of which the most important one is "the escape clause"!
> 
> 
> My final thoughts:

> 
> 1. Negotiate a contract extension with the current service provider in order to put the contract on the street. If the service provider refuses to negotiate a contract extension for the period it takes to develop a solid bid package and execute a multi-year agreement, then make plans to let the contract expire while aggressively exploring other service providers who can perform the required services - - even if multiple service providers are required. Competition lowers price, improves response time and increases quality.
> 
> 2. One important element of a sound contract management system is an early warning system. Having an early warning system in place will buy time to solve problems before they become major problems and expensive to fix. The customer (state workers/dependents and state retirees/dependents) are depending on you to get the best contract for employees/retirees.!

> †

> 3.† Finally, as I observe layoffs and cutbacks across the country, it is extremely rare that the owners or decision-makers spread sacrifice in an equitable way to save jobs or money for their respective companies/organizations. †If this rare kind of leadership becomes the norm, it will minimize adverse impact on its employers.† In the case of state workers, it is a perfect approach to take. †Sec. Tolson provided an example of shared sacrifice re. his Biotech †organization about a month ago; you will find my proposal above too.† Because of a shrinking manufacturing tax base, significantly increasing the tax on cigarettes, exploring a tax on certain services and closing tax loopholes could be a solution to help balance the budget. If you have any questions, please let me know. †Thank you for your service!

The Senate budget goes too far in cutting and dismantling early childhood programs.††I ask the Governor to fight for the funding and operational integrity of all levels of education programs ñ birth through higher education.† I ask the Senate rethink their postion on this budget that asks far too much from children and families.

Keeps MAF as currently operating with a $1 million cut from 202 unused slots.
†††† *I oppose the Senateís use of ARRA funds to replace state funding for MAF.
†††† *I oppose the programmatic change of MAF into a Plus subsidy program. †Reduced funding and transition to a different, untested new program makes it impossible to maintain current MAF standards, professional development T.E.A.C.H scholarships, and administrative functions.†
††††† *Federal child care subsidy regulations will deny services to many categories of at-risk four year olds living in families who would not qualify for subsidy funds, including military families.

Smart Start† should be at the lowest level with no restrictions. Give NCPC the flexibility to manage spending cuts that keep both Smart Startís commitment to child care subsidy and †to the other critical functions of the Smart Start program.

Support part of the Governorís position on subsidy based on her special provision in the Senate budget that allows for more flexibility for recently unemployed subsidy recipients. Use of the ARRA funding for that purpose will not happen under the Senate budget proposal. Support Senate market rate adjustment with funds from ARRA, especially targeting 4-5 star infant/toddler care.

And finally, before making broad and ill concieved decisions regarding early education, convene a commision to study a more effeicient method of service delivery.

Governor Purdue,
I am writing today to beg you to look back over the childcare budget. I see that as a family home provider, I will be charged a fee to have this license. I beg you to rethink this issue. As a family provider, I am required to receive 12 hours of childcare training per year. These trainings take me away from my family. I am required through the Stars Environmental Rating Scale to be a member of a professional group which meets monthly for a minimum of 2 hours so that's 24 additional hours I'm away from my family. I'm now enrolled in the 4 year Birth-K program at Western Carolina University and again, this also takes time from my family. For all this, we, the providers,†are still limited to 5 children. I earn $10.00/hour at 10 hours a day without a lunch break or any break during the day.
Most of us are not†at capacity†because of the economy but we continue to provide quality care anyway. Smart Start in my county allows†providers with 4 and 5 stars to receive bonus money monthly for salary supplement. However we do not receive this bonus money if our enrollment drops below 60%. Many of us, again because of the economy, have had our enrollment to drop which means we are not receiving the bonus money or are close to losing it if another child leaves out program.
Making $100.00/day with 5 children, I use my electricity, water, food, gas, personal belongings, house, car, my children's bedrooms, my children's toys and more to make sure these 5 children have the best day everyday. Now, I see that you are wanting to start charging us a fee on top of all this and†can't help but be†very upset. I have been in this business since 1976 and in my home daycare since 1995. As a self-employed provider, I want even get to reap the extra money in the paychecks that President Obama is making available to working Americans. Please don't punish me more for having a business. My tax accountant has told me for many years now that I am hurting myself by being self-employed but I have continued to stay in business because my heart is with the children I have in my care. We can only take so much though, Governor Purdue. We can't keep giving without getting before we get burned out and change out career choice. That leaves a bunch of unexperienced providers out there and where does that leave the children?
Thank you for taking the time to consider this email,

Dear Mrs. Perdue:




It has come to my attention that the Senate has proposed $100 million dollar in cuts in early childhood education.† As a pre-k teacher in Montgomery county, I will have to speak as an advocate for the many families that we serve.† You see most of our parents fall below the poverty line and do not have access to a computer to send a message via e-mail less than a fax machine.† Many do not feel comfortable writing a message because the parent's education is only at a high school level.† The children within these households need our help to break the cycle of poverty.† Our programs introduce vocabulary and skills that other children have at home.† These children do not.† Without our programs, you have personally sent these children on an educational journey without the tools to succeed.† In otherwords,you have set them up to failure.† Please do not decrease our funding especially with more families than ever in need due to the economy.† The children in these households do not have the support because their parents are stressed with the time consuming efforts of trying to find another job to survive.† Their households are at times falling apart financially and the only sanctum that provides relief from these pressures is pre-k.† Please do not steal the joy of childhood from these children.† Please consider decreases in other areas.† We are counting on you.



Sincerely,

Dear Governor Perdue,

I understand that the NC-Environmental Education (EE) Office is proposed
to be cut from the state budget. I understand the economic crisis has left
our state government with very tough decisions, which is leaves all of us
with responsibility. The proposed budget cut for the NC-EE Office saddens
me, because we as a nation are already loosing youth to a understanding of
our precious natural resources.  If we are to save what sustains us, we
must first create an ecologically literate citizenry, so that each
individual might develop a personal environmental ethic.  We as a state,
nation and society will be remembered for what we save, not what we build.
 Environmental Education is the only thing that can save our natural
resources, because the youth must first develop a value system...this
starts with education.  Thank you for considering the NC-EE Office in your
budget.

Sincerely,

Robert J. Hawk

Dear Governor Perdue,

I urge you to step in and fight the Senate's budget proposal,
which would destroy "More at Four," one of the country's most
highly rated pre-kindergarten programs. Especially given this
economic downturn, all families need access to high-quality
pre-k, and North Carolina needs to invest in building its human
capital -- starting with its youngest citizens.

Children and families urgently need you to speak out against the
Senate proposal, expected to pass today by a wide margin, which
would negatively impact nearly 30,000 children served by More at
Four. North Carolina voters and the nation, having heard your
support of high-quality pre-k in your State of the State
address, are watching.

North Carolina has been a national leader on early education,
and "More at Four" is one of only two state pre-k programs in
the country that meet all 10 quality benchmarks established by
the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER).
Please ensure that pre-k in North Carolina does not regress
under your watch and remains a fiscal priority in our state.

Governor Perdue,
I would like to thank you for working to protect Early Childhood Education programs for our young children and their families.† If†childcare services and programs are†cut by 25%, this will deeply impact our children and families now and in the future.† High quality child care and early education help families work and prepare children to be productive adults. Children who are at risk for later school failure are helped to succeed in school and later in life.† Money spent now on young children saves money later.† Investments in children are investments in our economy-now and in the future.† Our children of today can't afford a 25% cut.

FYI

The Governor is right on with the additional $1.00 per pack tax! Better still, make it $2.00 per pack. I see where the Governor's proposed additional tax to balance the budget has been gutted in a Bill. All leading medical experts in their fields agree that eliminating smoking by people will reduce health costs by billions of dollars; add the reduction of obesity in the U.S. and additional billions of dollars in health costs reduction will be realized. Unlike alcohol, there is no such thing as "moderation in smoking". When lead in gas and paint was discovered to be harmful to humans, it was removed by 100%! Since I believe that sound investments on the front-end are less costly than fixing or patching up problems on the back-end, it seems to me that the real hope is to reduce kids' smoking on the front-end to zero!† IMHO, this additional $1.00 tax on cigarettes should just be a start.

Dear Governor Purdue,

I thought you gave an excellent talk to the troops in Fayetteville. I do a lot of volunteer work with the Department of Defense and was there.

As the state grapples with the budget, one suggestion would be to combine the Marine Fisheries Commission with the Wildlife Commission. As it stands now, much effort is duplicated--two computer systems, two communication systems ( if fact they have transmitters on the same radio tower--both paying for the use of the tower. I have been in my boat in Taylors Creek in Beaufort and been stopped by Marine Fisheries to check my fish ( I have not caught any in a while ). Then a Wildlife†Officer comes by and checks for registration, life jackets, etc... Both boats had two people in them. I do not think this is an effective use to state employees.

I am sure there are many other savings† that can be obtained. Why not have someone study this and see what the actual savings could be.††If the state was run like a business, this would have been done a long time ago.†

Dear Governor Perdue,

I urge you to step in and fight the Senate's budget proposal,
which would destroy "More at Four," one of the country's most
highly rated pre-kindergarten programs. Especially given this
economic downturn, all families need access to high-quality
pre-k, and North Carolina needs to invest in building its human
capital -- starting with its youngest citizens.

Children and families urgently need you to speak out against the
Senate proposal, expected to pass today by a wide margin, which
would negatively impact nearly 30,000 children served by More at
Four. North Carolina voters and the nation, having heard your
support of high-quality pre-k in your State of the State
address, are watching.

North Carolina has been a national leader on early education,
and "More at Four" is one of only two state pre-k programs in
the country that meet all 10 quality benchmarks established by
the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER).
Please ensure that pre-k in North Carolina does not regress
under your watch and remains a fiscal priority in our state.

The Honorable Governor Beverly Perdue, Committee appointees and Constituent Services:



Folks this Legislation is an important step in regaining the trust of the citizenry as well as to any qualified study of the efficiency of the Public Funded Pretrial Release Program. This mandate for responsible accountability would only require what should already be compiled and available at the touch of the finger. Offender by offender clarification is the only true measure of efficiency and should supersede the present policy of accepting whatever the biased programís director is compelled to submit to favor the productivity of the program. Where is accountability in this picture? This is very true when considering the cuts to education bringing much displeasure from citizens as well as our school boards. It would most certainly create outrage from the citizenry to know that much needed public monies are being wasted on the criminal element versus our school children absent this system for accountability. †It is about millions of dollars being denied the individual school systems upon penalty of the forfeiture process associated with the private entityís failure to perform as opposed to the Criminal Welfare Revolving Door Public Funded Pretrial Release Programís policies under no penalty for failing to perform. It is about releasing dangerous offenders into the population to further victimize at the expense of the unknowing tax payer. However in truth, this is not about private versus public; contrarily it is about accountability and giving our Legislators and individual budgeting entities across this State the tools necessary to properly account and establish the efficiency of all appropriations from the publicís purse. This is about supporting our Nationís President in his pledge for transparency in government appropriations.



That's what President Obama essentially revoked. Here's an excerpt from the FOIA memo:

The Freedom of Information Act should be administered with a clear presumption: In the face of doubt, openness prevails. The Government should not keep information confidential merely because public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure, because errors and failures might be revealed, or because of speculative or abstract fears... All agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure, in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA, and to usher in a new era of open government. The presumption of disclosure should be applied to all decisions involving FOIA.

And an excerpt from the memo "Transparency and Open Government":

Information maintained by the federal government is a national asset. My administration will take appropriate action, consistent with law and policy, to disclose information rapidly in forms that the public can readily find and use. Executive departments and agencies should harness new technologies to put information about their operations and decisions online and readily available to the public.

I find it extremely alarming when any tax paid program fights this hard to discourage this needed tool when they rightfully should be more than willing to ëshowcase their waresí. The mandates of this Legislation would only require them to do what is already statutorily required of other public funded entities such as law enforcement and even our courts.





The question at hand is simply; how do we measure up and how well do we commit to meet the necessary challenges? †Is our Presidentís mandating simply rhetoric or a sincere vision for open governance? The ball is in your court!!

The Honorable Beverly Perdue

Governor for this Great State of North Carolina,



First Governor, allow me to extend my congratulations to a most successful campaign. As you stated on many occasions, while campaigning across this state; ìIt takes all of us to make it work.î



While your tenure has only begun, it is truly refreshing to see you come out in favor of an open and inclusive government as exemplified in the January 14th Raleigh News and Observer article ìThatís an orderî.î Perdue also signed orders to post state grants and contracts on a central Web site. That's another good public access idea, along with town hall meetings, four of them, during her term. And Perdue was consistent in her campaign in vowing to open state records and conduct business in the open, which wasn't always the case with former Gov. Mike Easley.î



It is very frustrating when one knows of a true injustice and canít seem to get anyone to just look at it unbiased. This is especially true, when considering our present economic state of affairs. Fulfilling the need list should always prioritize the wish list of special interest.



Governor Iím attaching some points for study on my concerns; I truly recognize how busy you are but strongly feel this is deserving of considerations and study by your task force. Please donít hesitate to contact me if I can answer any question or be of service in any way.



Respectfully,



Steven F. Shell

Subject: Environment

Comment: May 1, 2009 Honorable Governor Perdue, May 1, 2009 A recent PBS TV program told about studies that reveal the devastating water pollution to our fish and seafood industries in the Chesapeake Bay, its rivers and creeks and also in Washington State‚Äôs rivers and waterways. Most was caused by industrial waste and contaminates. Contamination includes waste from factory poultry and animal farms. Sometimes the spillovers of the hog lagoon contents from heavy rains get into our streams and rivers and contribute raw sewerage in the waters from which municipal water is supplied. These nitrates and other chemicals in the water cause algae to grow and bloom to the point the sunlight cannot penetrate it and oxygen is blocked from any creature trying to live in the water. We‚Äôve all seen the results with the fish kills and contaminated oysters and clams and the scarcity of these items in our food supply as the population of seafood is diminished. Other sources of pollutions come from chemicals such as PCB‚Äôs found in asphalt runoff from parking lots, roofs and highways as well as medical wastes and chemicals from hospitals and the general public. Most of our water treatment plants do not remove the chemicals. That‚Äôs why frogs have been found with 2 sets of hormones and extra legs. Our elected officials, who have a responsibility to protect and defend the rights of the citizenry that elected them, have failed in their duties. A clean and healthy environment is among those rights. Multi-national corporations are big exporters and part of the global economy and the WTO. Together they want to build a new port on wetlands (natural filters and purifiers of water) in Southport and a new cement plant in Castle Hayne. I strongly oppose both of these projects. They would cause more air and water pollution, killing our seafood and tourism industries in addition to our clean drinking water. Even if thousands of new jobs were created in our local economy (which admittedly is not true) how can the additional environmental harm justify approving these projects? They would likely be funded on the backs of NC taxpayers and the cost of correcting the environmental problems in the future would be devastating to the citizens. We need government regulations in place to protect our communities and our human health from unsafe business practices without exceptions. Any business project that has the potential to degrade our community should be held up to the highest scrutiny. The public is constantly fighting against paid business lobbyists in our federal and state legislatures who present biased research and studies to gain their favor and support for activities that negatively impact our environment with harmful pollutants. Thank you for not supporting these proposals to build a new port in Southport or a cement plant in Castle Hayne. Lorraine Hoge Lorraine Hoge

Comment: I was very upset to read about the House member who recently was let go with a warning after driving over 100 mph on our highways. I understand he may now have been charged, but feel that there IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THE HIGHWAY PATROL's enforcment policy, in that he was not initially charged. Our law officers showing favoritism for some elected officials CANNOT be codoned...and MUST be stopped. Failure to charge the man initially was WRONG and someone needs to ensure that this DOES NOT HAPPEN EVER AGAIN..someone in the Highway Patrol should be reprimanded, at a minimum and the public assured that the law treats all citizens equally.....

Alarmed and dismayed about the nuclear power plant engineering & construction management company.† Will humans
learn before it is too late, that poisoning ourselves while attempting to sustain ourselves is a path to nowhere, e.g.,
global warming!† All of our resources should be going to transition from poisonous energy methods and to
renewable, safe energy.† When we live in a country with so much sun and wind, as well as abundant water for wave energy
as well as the production of algae, and abundant fertile terrain to grow industrial hemp [No, it is not marijuana - READ UP ON IND. HEMP PLEASE.† THE ONLY REASON IND. HEMP WAS MADE ILLEGAL WAS THAT DUPONT DID NOT WANT COMPETITION
WITH HIS PLASTIC (FRM OIL & COAL) & HEARST WITH HIS TIMBER INTERESTS.† HEMP COULD BE THE NEW TOBACCO FOR NORTH CAROLINA.† WAKE UP, WAKE UP, WAKE UP!!!!!]† There is a state democrat rep. from Chapel Hill and a republican from Greensboro that are on board for this.† I have no doubt that Obama is intelligent enough to fight the foolish interests that are willing to kill their own children for profit.† THE ONLY FUSION POWER I CAN IMAGINE ANYONE CONSIDERING IS THE COLD FUSION TYPE
RECENTLY READDRESSED (AS SEEN ON SIXTY MINUTES A FEW NIGHTS AGO).†

Frankly, if counterintuitive policies of this sort are continually put forth by Gov. Perdue, I will work for another person to be
governor next election - hopefully it will not be too late for us all - we've already lost so much time with self-interested foolish
people thwarting reversal of the petroleum and nuclear waste poisoning of the last many decades.

Toshiba America Nuclear Energy Corp., a nuclear power plant engineering and construction management company, will open its national project management and engineering center in Mecklenburg County.† The company plans to invest $2.8 million† and create 194 new jobs in Charlotte during the next five years.
<unknown.jpg>ìNorth Carolina is a world leader in providing the knowledge-based workforce, design and research support vital to the development of the energy† sector,î Gov. Perdue said.† ìOur stateís business-friendly policies and unparalleled quality of life continue to attract top global companies and high-paying jobs.î
The stateís Economic Investment Committee awarded a Job Development Investment Grant to Toshiba America Nuclear Energy Corp. to facilitate this new project.† While wages will vary by position, the company plans to create new jobs with an average† annual wage of $122,037, not including benefits.† This greatly exceeds the Mecklenburg County average annual wage of $49,400.
Toshiba America Nuclear Energy Corp., based in Virginia, is part of Toshiba America Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Toshiba Corp. The company markets and sells advanced boiling water nuclear reactors (ABWR) to be constructed in the United† States and provides engineering, licensing, construction management, maintenance and other services for nuclear power plants. The company also sells turbines and other major equipment for nuclear power plants.
Job Development Investment Grants are awarded only to new and expanding businesses and industrial projects whose benefits exceed the costs to the state and†would not be undertaken in North Carolina without the grant.† Since the first grant† was awarded in 2003, the program has been responsible for creating commitments for more than 30,000 jobs and $5 billion in investment in North Carolina.
Other partners that assisted with this announcement include: the N.C. Department of Commerce, the N.C. Department of Revenue, the Charlotte Regional Partnership, Mecklenburg County, City of Charlotte and the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce.
Governor Perdue Takes Additional Steps to Ensure a Balanced Budget
Gov. Bev Perdue is taking additional steps to ensure the stateís budget is balanced on June 30, 2009.† The move comes in response to an analysis by the Office of State Budget Management that indicates the budget shortfall for fiscal year 2008-09† will likely exceed $3 billion.
Gov. Perdue this week signed Executive Order 11, which implements a flexible furlough program for all state employees.† This furlough equates to $65 million this year.† In addition, she has identified funds to close the remaining budget gap for the fiscal year, which include capturing more special funds, tapping the stateís Savings Reserve Account and utilizing federal recovery dollars.† These measures total more than $1 billion.
All teachersí and state employeesí compensation will be reduced by an annualized amount equivalent to 0.5 percent for the remainder of the fiscal year. Each employee will receive 10 hours of flexible time off in exchange.† The governor has asked the General Assembly to pass legislation holding longevity pay, unused leave, service credit and health and retirement benefits harmless.
ìNorth Carolina continues to experience the effects of a national economic crisis, which force me to make difficult decisions in order to maintain a balanced budget through June,î said Gov. Perdue. ìI will do what I must in order to ensure† that North Carolina can pay our bills and provide the essential services required by our citizens.î
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Outreach from the Department of Transportation
NCDOT recognizes the importance of giving all businesses the opportunity to do work with the department on transportation projects. Unfortunately, not all businesses have the resources and contacts necessary† to find out about these contracts. Through the departmentís Business Opportunity and Workforce Development Office, NCDOT is holding a series of outreach meetings in the state aimed at informing Disadvantaged Business Enterprises of contracting opportunities† in transportation and on projects funded with monies from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
A Disadvantaged Business Enterprise is a small, independent business that is at least 51 percent minority- or women-owned. At least one of these owners must control the firm's management and daily operations, and the owners must share in the† risks and profits commensurate with their ownership interest.
These outreach meetings give DBEís†opportunities to network, to hear from NCDOT field personnel about upcoming available contracts and to learn how to become a certified and prequalified contractor.†
So far, these meetings have received great response from businesses that otherwise would not have had as many opportunities to work on NCDOT projects. To date, meetings have been held in Asheville, Charlotte, Edenton, Fayetteville, Raleigh† and Wilson. Upcoming meetings will take place in†Winston-Salem, Greenville, Greensboro, Carthage and Castle Hayne.††Click here for the†locations, dates† and times.
Economic Recovery Workshop
On Tuesday, Governor Perdue hosted an Economic Recovery Workshop in Winston-Salem.† It was <unknown.jpg>the first†of six workshops planned across the state.† Future workshops will be held in Asheville, Charlotte, Greenville, Raleigh and Wilmington during the next few weeks.† For details of future events go to <http://www.NCRecovery.gov>www.NCRecovery.gov.
Governor Perdue was joined by her†recovery†czar, Dempsey Benton, and many other experts from various state agencies handling recovery funds.† The workshops are†a good opportunity for local officials, community and business leaders, and citizens to ask questions†and hear†the latest news on how recovery dollars will be spent in North† Carolina.

While nearly 500 emails were generated lastnight to lawmakers on the <http://capwiz.com/nea/nc/issues/alert/?alertid=12912866&type=ST&azip=27519&bzip=5933&show_alert=1>out-of-state tuition program funded by NC taxpayers, a handful†of NCAE members†wrote to DPB†that an end to the out-of-state provision may jeopardize future basketball championships.

"While this provision is only three years old, UNC System schools have always paid the out-of-state tuition for scholarship athletes," said NCAE Vice President Rodney Ellis, a hoops fan whose office is adorned with Michael Jordan images.† "It's a matter of who is paying the bill -- the Rams Club, the Wolfpack Club, the Pirate Club or the taxpayer."

Until three years ago, out-of-state athlete tuition bills were paid for by the booster clubs of UNC System Schools.† In 2005, a provision was slipped into the state's budget that mandated North Carolina taxpayers pay for the†out-of-state portion of the scholarship and the booster clubs†pay the in-state portion.

"UNC and NC State all won national championships without the provision and out-of-state athletes like Mia Hamm and Terry Gannon†had their tuition paid in full," explained Ellis.† "$10 million could have saved 1/3 of our public educators from being furloughed.† We could have reduced the cuts to our members' pay to 0.033%."

All†sixteen UNC affiliated schools benefit from this provision and it covers all varsity sports.†


Atkinson, Marshall & Goodwin Take Half-Percent Pay Cut

††††††††††††††††††††††† I'm sure this will be filed in the trash but I'm still going to chime in on a topic. As far as the (some) state employees reduced income goes, why is this a state employee problem and not a state problem? Did just the state employees create this deficient? If so, then rightly we should feel the full effects of it's blow. However, it was the entire state of NC which has created this and it should be the entire state who feels it's effects. By that I mean everyone who lives in NC should have had their state taxes increased to compensate for this. We as state employees are fronting the full effect of this. Another thing, with the millions in eduction lottery money I don't think we should be in such dire conditions as we are now in. How has that money been spent. I would like for a detailed budget report to be made available on line for the people in this state to see; penny by penny, how OUR money is being spent. What about the Federal money this state was given? If we as state employees are going to be forced to make up for foolish spending then we should have some say on what it's spent on. Don't get me started on where excess and wasteful spending is being done and the hundreds of thousands that could be saved with a little common sense or self restraint. You wouldn't spend your own personal money on some of these things so why spend mine? This money that is being taken from us is not for governments personal use to spend how they please.

Comment: S. Micah Lee 2408 Cobblestone Ct. Newton, NC 28658-8452 May 6, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: As a sportsman I would like to ask you to consider transferring the roughly $27 million back to the Clean Water Management Trust Fund (CWMTF) to pay for a group of land acquisition projects and issue $17 million in the Certificates of Participation (COP) for the most time sensitive approved projects. I understand that you have had to make tough choices to balance the state's current budget, including transferring money from several trust funds into the general fund to meet cash flow needs. I know those decisions were not easy. I also appreciate all that you have done over the years to create and support full funding for the CWMTF. Your leadership has resulted in hundreds of water quality success stories throughout North Carolina. I would like to bring to your attention a set of conservation land acquisition projects that have been placed in serious jeopardy and I respectfully request that you take steps to resolve these issues. There are 37 land acquisition projects that were approved by the CWMTF, totaling $27,695,520, in which the land trust or local government is legally obligated to pay the landowner because they have a signed option or contract with the landowner. In some of these cases, the transactions are already closed between the land trust and the landowner, including several instances in which the land trust must repay a loan which enabled them to close the deal. They now have no way to repay the loan without possibly selling the property. Also, the current budget includes $50 million in Certificates of Participation for acquisition projects funded by the Natural Heritage Trust Fund and Parks and Recreation Trust Fund. To date, only $10 million in COP's have been issued. I urge you to issue approximately $17 million in COP's for six pending conservation projects. These represent the most time-sensitive of the $40 million remaining. Sincerely, S. Micah Lee 8284654007

Subject: FIPP and More at 4

Comment: I am writing to you to let you know how devastating it will be to get rid of the FIPP program and the More at 4 program. I am a parent of a child with autism and these 2 programs are very important in our lives. The truth is there are very few programs that will accept my son. I will admit he can be a handful but the FIPP workers just help me through it and never say a word. Anytime I have needed support for my son FIPP has been there. I have worked with many different people in the organization. Jacob, my son, has received Speech Therapy and Occupational therapy through them. I have had their staff come to my house to help me teach my son. The playgroup that they run gave my son skills to be able to play and also play with other children something I thought would not be possible. If you close down FIPP I have no idea what we will do and what about the children that will be there in the future. Please do not let our budget problems tell our disabled children we do not care about them. Next is the More at 4, we can not cut out this program. At age 3 disabled children no longer receive help from the CDSA. They are placed in the school system where they receive their therapies. The More at 4 program allows these children to be in a school setting and learn what will help them when they go to Kindergarten. They are expected to be able to function in Kindergarten but without any support from More at 4 they will not be able to. That will not only take away from their education but also the education of the other children in their class. My son is now in the More at 4 program. He has learned so much and I think one more year of More at 4 will have him ready to transition into Kindergarten. Being a mom of an autistic son I know what he would be like taking him into Kindergarten. He would shut down for awhile and then meltdown. He has 2 hour long screaming, crying meltdowns. The More at 4 program for him was eased into and now I am able to leave him there with no phone calls about meltdowns. Please do not take this program away from our children, it could be detrimental to our future. They will be the ones in charge of our country one day. Thank You, Lisa Hanlon Concerned Parent of a disabled child

Subject: State Budget

Comment: I completely understand the need for the governor to balance the state budget, but it is my understanding that this is a problem for EVERY citizen of NC, not just state employees. Please explain to me how it is fair to reduce the pay of these employess ONLY because the state controls their paycheck and they are an easy target. Why isn't every worker in NC being asked to balance the budget? Wouldn't a small tax increase be more appropriate? What the governor did, in effect, was impose a tax directed only at state employees by cutting their paycheck. I also fail to understand how you can hire a teacher at a certain salary, have that teacher work ALL year, then change the salary after the work has been performed. I want to be supportive of Ms. Perdue and I do want to balance the state budget. I just don't want to be the only group of employees doing it when it is a STATE problem, NOT a state employee problem. I would appreciate an answer that can help me understand how this decision was made and how it is justified both legally and morally. Thank you, Mary Ford

Subject: pay cut

Comment: hello Mrs.Gov. Perdue i'm glad to say that u r our Gov., but i have an opinion to a concern. Me and my wife r state workers and we try to keep up with the news concerning the budget, we all here in fayetteville like the idea of the furrlough (i think i spelled it right). about the 10hrs off and the half percent pay cut, so we was all wondering since saving all the money from thev state workers why not do it for the next 2 years, the state could get its money and all state workers would continue working. Its a thought, u all have a good day ,please respond.
