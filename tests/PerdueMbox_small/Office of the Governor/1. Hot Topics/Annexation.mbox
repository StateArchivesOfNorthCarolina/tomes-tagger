Ladies and Gentlemen,

I echo Mr. Remes comments.

I spent 20 years of my life in the military preparing to defend this country. Of those 20 years, 3 years was spent in a combat zone where the fight was for freedom of the people of South Vietnam. North Carolina's involuntary annexation laws are a slap in the face to many of us who spent our time supporting the freedoms that†North Carolina so willing destroy via forced annexation.
Take Care, May God Bless you, and may you have a Marvelous and Wonderful day.

Updated my raleigh speach from last year†and sent it in a mass email to all the people on the finance comittee. Thought youall might like to see it:

My name is Wayne Remes and I live in Rowan County.



Iím the one the Salisbury Post anonymously quoted as suggesting that ìThe Good Neighbors of Rowan Countyî anti annexation group be called ìCitizens against Fascismî. So I think you know my position on involuntary annexation.



Involuntary annexation is a matter of self determination, and as such cuts to the very heart of what the United States stands for. The Declaration of Independence itself listed some of the reasons for our separation as ìThe imposing of Taxes on us without our consentî and ìAbolishing of free system of English Laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule within these Colonies.î



Municipalities throughout North Carolina are engaging in these vary activities AS THE NORM. The idea that free North Carolina citizens having chose to not live within municipal boundaries, should at some later point, against their will, be forced to live within municipal boundaries without so much as a vote by said citizens is an abomination, and laws allowing such should not be allowed to stand



The League of Municipalities and other snake oil salesman supporting involuntary annexation have said that in order to grow, municipalities must involuntarily annex places, yet 57% of annexations from 2000 to 2005 were voluntary. People elected to join the city because it was to their benefit. Areas added to a municipality thru forced annexed receive less benefit from being part of the municipality than they do by being a part of the county, thatís why itís involuntary. They are added solely for the purpose of increasing revenue to the municipality, and to the extreme detriment of those living in the area being added. In finance bringing in new investors to provide the principle investors with more revenue while providing nothing to the new investors is called a Ponzi scheme. Forced Annexation is nothing more than Municipal finance by Ponzi scheme, and is just plain wrong.



The words and images associated with involuntary annexations are usually mentioned in connection with Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, Stalin, and Saddam Hussein. Indeed, when I think of involuntary annexation, what comes to my mind are the words ìTODAY WE ANNEX THE SUDETENLAND, THIS IS MY LAST TERRATORIAL DEMAND!î Hitlerís policies should be able to be associated with North Carolina politicians



HB524 does not allow for individuals in the area being annexed to vote. The last time American politicians allowed free American citizens to be forced to live where they did not wish to live, was the placing of Japanese-Americans into internment camps during World War 2. Forced annexation is the same thing, except we are not being relocated into internment camps; they are relocating the internment camps to us. Why was this wrong in World War 2, yet accepted North Carolina state policy today. †



†Over 500,000 Americans have given their life to bring self determination to other nations, yet here in North Carolina, for some reason, we are not guaranteed this right. Allowing forced annexation to be the law is spitting in the face of every American serviceman who died bringing that right to peoples of the world. Removing forced annexation from the law, is not only the right thing for any American to do, itís really the only thing anyone calling themselves an American can do. Please



Forcing county residents to join a municipality, often only after the municipality has expanded several times to get closer to them is JUST PLAIN WRONG, MORALLY. Please, please donít allow the abomination and attack on the American spirit that is HB524 to get to the floor. I would be there in person, but unlike the majority of the League of Muncipalites supporters†I am not being paid to tell you my position on annexation. I have already used my available leave going to Raleigh 3 times in the last 2 months to tell†legislatures†that†forced annexation as a concept is at best flawed and at worst a form of neo-fascim.†



Thank You

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession,†which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our stateís unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent ó 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolinaís families have been hurt by the recession, so has our stateís budget.

The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolinaís history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolinaís government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our stateís mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolinaís long-term economic growth.

Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect†core education, public safety and health care services,†or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

Public education always†has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolinaís economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

Iíve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect†public education.† Now I need your help.† The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.† But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our childrenís education.

The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.



††††††††††Sincerely,


††††††††††† Bev Perdue

I spent last 2 weeks at NC Leg bldg and witnessed Democracy not at work,
as forced annexation and power and greed to the League of Municipalities
won over the people. I have the personal pain to bare. Trust, faith and
soon Hope will be lost to the power and greed and Government intervention
in everything.

It will take a walk on Washington DC, a ring of vehicles around the
beltway and thousands on the mall to protest Government power over the
people and give our country back through the constitution and power to the
people, for the people by the people.

Happy 4th

Increased Opportunity for Historically Underutilized Businesses

The Office for Historically Underutilized Businesses (HUB)†launched its new Statewide Uniform Certification (SWUC) program on Wednesday.† SWUC was developed to streamline the certification process, reduce the redundancy in certifying minority and women-owned businesses and create a centralized HUB and minority/women business database.† The HUB Office will take the lead in certifying HUB and Minority/Women Business Enterprise (M/WBE) firms that previously had to apply for certification both through the state HUB Office and local M/WBE program offices.

‚ÄúThis initiative will expand opportunities for minority-, disabled- and women-owned businesses to participate in state and local government contracts,‚Äù said Gov. Bev Perdue, who recently issued Executive Order No. 13 to assist HUB firms. ‚ÄúWe trust it will help the state achieve, and hopefully exceed, its aspirational goal of at least 10 percent of all state government contracts being awarded to HUB firms.‚Äù

SWUC is the result of N.C. General Statute 143-128.4, 143-48.4.† It was developed by the HUB Office in collaboration with local M/WBE program directors and with feedback from HUB firms, prime contractors and HUB resource advocates.† In addition to increasing efficiency and service to the HUB community, SWUC will establish a centralized database for state agencies, local municipalities and contractors looking to identify and utilize HUB vendors and sub-contractors.

Buncombe County Manufacturer to Add 32 Jobs

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that Baldor Electric Co., an international supplier of industrial electric motors, mechanical power transmission products, drives and generators, will expand its Weaverville operations.† The company plans to invest more than $4.8 million and create 32 jobs during the next three years.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $64,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

‚ÄúNorth Carolina remains attractive to thriving companies like this one,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said.† ‚ÄúOur top-ranked business climate and knowledge-based workforce help keep our manufacturing sector strong and diverse, providing the good jobs our citizens have come to expect.‚Äù

Baldor Electric Co., headquartered in Arkansas, operates 26 manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Canada, England, Mexico and China, and provides products to more than 70 countries. Three of the company‚Äôs plants are in North Carolina, employing a combined workforce of nearly 700 people.

Baldor is consolidating its Sleevoil hydrodynamic bearing line in Indiana and moving those operations to its Weaverville plant, which currently employs 128 workers.† The 32 new jobs added over the next three years will pay an average wage of $42,209, not including benefits, which is higher than the Buncombe County average of $32,968.

This project follows two other recent One NC Fund announcements for Baldor facilities in Western North Carolina.† In June, Gov. Perdue announced 114 new jobs and an investment of $12.2 million in Cleveland County.† In May, the governor announced 25 new jobs and an investment of $3.1 million in McDowell County.

For more information about Baldor Electric Co., including employment opportunities, visit: <http://www.baldor.com/>www.baldor.com.

"Booze It & Lose It: Operation Firecracker"

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that state and local law enforcement officers will be out in full force over the Fourth of July holiday as part of the ‚ÄúBooze It & Lose It: Operation Firecracker‚Äù campaign. Checkpoints and stepped-up patrols will be conducted Monday, June 29, through Sunday, July 5, across the state in an effort to remove impaired drivers from the roads.

‚ÄúToo many people fail to understand that alcohol and driving don‚Äôt mix. Impaired driving is no accident, nor is it a victimless crime,‚Äù Perdue said. ‚ÄúLaw enforcement officers will crack down on impaired drivers, ensuring that everyone is celebrating the holiday responsibly.‚Äù

There were 377 alcohol-related crashes, 322 with injuries and 12 that resulted in fatalities, over the Independence Day week last year.

Officers charged more than 1,900 North Carolina motorists with driving while impaired during the 2008 ‚ÄúBooze It & Lose It: Operation Firecracker‚Äù campaign. More than 5,700 stepped-up patrols and checkpoints were held.
