Subject: Farm Workers' Rights Now!

Comment: Michael Gore 4805 Yorkwood Dr Greensboro, NC 27407-4065 September 3, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing on behalf of farm workers like Salvador Solis who are fighting for their right to be treated just like workers in every other industry. He says, "We are made of flesh and blood, just like everyone else. We work hard. We have families. We have dreams of a better future. We deserve to have a day of rest, to be paid overtime and to join a union if we choose just like everyone else." Under current law, farm workers are denied: * Overtime pay provisions of Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). * The minimum wage provisions of the FLSA (on farms that employ fewer than seven workers). * The child labor protections of the FLSA. The law's protections against the hazards of students working in shopping malls are stronger than the protections against children working in agriculture where toxic pesticides, heavy machinery and other hazards threaten their future. * The right to join labor unions and bargain collectively. Please do your best to right this wrong by supporting legislation that would remove exemptions for agriculture from the labor laws. Sincerely, Michael Gore 336-294-8268

Subject: Free Poker Leagues

Comment: I'm writing you in regards to the state law on playing poker in North Carolina. I'm a entrepreneur and run a successful poker league in the state of Va. I've read letters from District Attorneys in Monroe and they see what I do as a scheme or having deceptive motives for running the league. I run a professional vegas style league inside of area restaurants. I offer it totally free to area residents or members. No buy-ins or membership fees! I charge the venue a small nightly fee to run these nightly events. I give away prizes, cash totally out of my pocket to the players. My question is why is this wrong? In the economy we're in, my business offers jobs with part time hours and full time wages to those who wish to run them a whole week. We boost area sales in venues and give back to localities. I really would like to see something be changed with this. I understand the question at hand is poker a game of skill or chance. Why does it really matter? The Nc state lottery offers false hopes of hitting it big and some people's paychecks are invested weekly into these daily & nightly drawings. But because the state receives a percentage and gives public schools money it's ok. When in fact it's totally no different then what the law makers describe in their own laws. I hope to hear from you on this matter so this law can be better revised and give hope to entrepreneurs like myself and others...

Subject: Support Sensible Poker Legislation

Comment: Daniel Hood 211 Church Street Chapel Hill, NC 27516-2561 September 8, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: The U.S. Congress is considering legislation to license, regulate, and tax online games of skill like poker. The legislation contains a provision that allows states to opt out of the federal licensing program, and the choice for our state to stay in or opt out will come shortly after implementation of the legislation. As a constituent, voter, and proud poker player, I ask that you support keeping our state in this important program. U.S. House Bill H.R. 2267 and U.S. Senate Bill S. 1597 provide for sensible licensing, regulation, and taxation of Internet poker. They mandate rigorous, verifiable safeguards against underage participation while providing consumer protections for the millions, including many in our state, who play online poker every day. These bills also include dedicated funding to establish and implement programs for prevention and treatment of those with excessive gaming habits. Both bills benefit our state economically. According to an economic study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers in April, tax revenues from these bills will provide billions of dollars to the U.S. Treasury and to the states in the program. Additionally, the Senate bill provides for revenue-sharing with participating states, bringing even more much-needed funds into our state's coffers. Both bills allow American companies to participate in the world's Internet poker market, bringing needed jobs to our state as well. Solutions like H.R. 2267 and S. 1597 provide the most rational approach to controlling this industry and preserving it for adults who choose to engage in games of skill like poker. An unenforceable, unpopular prohibition provides none of these benefits. All prohibition can do is drive players underground or overseas while limiting my personal freedom. What's most important to me is your support for my rights. Please respond to this letter and let me know if you will support keeping our state in this important program. I will be watching your actions on this issue closely. I hope that I, along with my over one million fellow Poker Players Alliance members can count on your support. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Daniel Hood 2529033011

	To Whom it may Concern:

	I know several people who receive help from DSS (Department of Social Services).
	These people like to do rent a kid. Basically they ask family or friends
	to split tax return with them and their kids become their family or friends dependents
	for the year. They receive help from DSS and on top of that they commit fraud by renting their kids
	as dependents to people on taxes. The DSS agency should make all receipts of help show a tax return
	and should be verified through a quick on line tax return check that it was filled with the IRS.

	This step would also help to catch Illegal immigrants who are receiving DSS help and to help keep
	tax fraud down which would help the state in the long run. One person I know who is guilty of renting
	her kids out is Tammy (Ezzell) Dillion. Tammy allows her mother Bonnie Ezzell of
	822 Stone Street, Haw River NC 27258, Bonnie phone 336-578-5065 to claim her kids as dependents on
	tax returns while DSS pays Tammy Housing, receives Medicaid, food stamps and other various
	help from DSS for her family while tammy and bonnie ezzell commit tax fraud so Tammy can get
	more money out of the Government and that her mother would not owe taxes to the irs. her Mother
	 If the IRS had wanted to do a serious AUDIT on Tammy and her Mother than they would
	 a) contact Alamance County DSS at 336-570-6570 and have them copy there records
	and submit them to do an audit on Bonnie Ezzell and Tammy Dillion. B) contact Alamance county school board and get
	all of Draco Dill ions school background to check which school he has attended and the address they used to
	get him into those schools (School Board of Alamance county phone # 336-570-6060).

	If the IRS had verified any documents that was sent to them and verified with DSS information they could prove
	easily that the above named people have committed tax fraud. With the age of computers anyone can do up
	documents from home and no one would be the wiser about it if they came from a school, dss or a persons home
	computer without verifying from the source the validation of such documents. DSS Graham Housing during some
	of these years paid for Tammy, Draco, and Kyra housing and a letter from them alone would prove tax fraud. If Irs
	would place a few calls and validate information instead of just assuming documents submitted are accurate and
	done by the agency and not on someone homes computer.

	Bonnie Ezzell is also guilty of cheating on her unemployment by working under the table at Cindy's Food Mart
	330 Roxboro St Haw River NC 27258 PHONE: 336-578-2924. This way she draws her full unemployment amount
	and still try to have extra money. Bonnie Ezzell believes she can cheat the system and get away with it.

Dear Governor Perdue and Secretary Cansler,

I'm writing to voice my concern over the Legislature's recent $2.3 million cut to the Special Assistance appropriation, which helps pay for care for residents in North Carolina's 1,400 assisted-living facilities.

While you can't undo the Legislature's cuts, you have it in your power to stand up and help more than 25,000 elderly North Carolinians whose lives will be negatively impacted by the Legislature's actions.

You can help by asking the federal Medicaid program to pay for the full range of health support services that adult care homes provide for residents, including:

Monitoring and supervising residents' health and mental health on a 24-hour basis

Managing their medications

Making sure they are eating right and getting the nutrition they need.

That will mean more federal Medicaid dollars for assisted-living residents in North Carolina. It will enable adult care homes to provide quality care. And it will mean better health care services for more than 25,000 of our state's most vulnerable citizens.

Medicaid is paying for those services today in many other states - and in nursing homes and home care right here in North Carolina. Why shouldn't Medicaid pay for the same services in adult care homes?

Please take action today to ensure that North Carolina's assisted-living residents get the care they need.

Dear Governor Perdue and Secretary Cansler,

I am writing to introduce myself and some of my assisted living residents that have been and will continue to be affected by the 2.3 million dollar cut to the Special Assistance budget. I know this can not be reversed, but after "meeting" some of "my folks"
I hope you will every power in your possession to fight the pending cut to Medicaid dollars for this same population of senior citizens.

"Richard" is a 94 yr old retired farmer from Eastern NC. Despite the hard work and hard times, as he calls it, he invested wisely & by having no luxeries for himself and his family in his earlier life, he saved enough money to pay privately at my assisted living facility, the Vintage Inn, the first two years he lived with us. Having exhaused his resources he became eligible for Medicaid and Special Assistance to help supplement his Social Security, although he hated the idea of being on "welfare".

"Alice" is a 72 year old disabled widow that could no longer live at home due to financial explortation. Her "loved ones" were right there with outstretched hand on the 3rd of each month waiting for her money, while her own needs went unmet. Months of this lead to verbal and physical abuse and deplorable home environment. Adult protective services ensured an end was put to this situation & "Alice" became one of our Vintage Inn family 16 months ago.

Lastly, "Mr. Lester" is 83 with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's. His family kept him at home as long as possible, until his wife's declining health made it necessary for placement in Vintage Inn's Memory Care Unit. Like most people with dementia, "Mr. Lester" wanders and is determined he needs to leave the facility at 7:00AM to go to work, like he did so-o-o many years of his life. It is amazing how a walk around the building with specially trained staff can offer him the validation needed of how important work is and the type of work he is familiar with. By the time "Mr. Lester" and his CNA have reached the front door of the facility again, he feels validated, accepts staff's offer of a cup of coffee with the promise of breakfast in just a few minutes.

These three wonderful seniors are but a sample of the residents at our facility. All three will be impacted by the Medicaid cut as will the other 110 residents I am responsible for. This cut will have to have an impact on the quality care they receive due to the termination of staff with which they are familiar and comfortable, as well as the quality of the meals and the nurtitional value necessary to promote/maintain skin tegor and hydration of the elderly population.

While I know a change must be made in the current Medicaid system, please investigate and cut less deserving programs, such as the numerous mentoring programs, than programs that provide a home for deserving elders. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this situation further with you. Should you have any questions please feel free to contact me via email or phone. The number is 252-792-8311. I appreciate your ,your time and attention to my Vintage Inn family.

Sincerely,

Becky B. Dymek
Administrator
Vintage Inn

	To Whom it may Concern:

	I know several people who receive help from DSS (Department of Social Services).
	These people like to do rent a kid. Basically they ask family or friends
	to split tax return with them and their kids become their family or friends dependents
	for the year. They receive help from DSS and on top of that they commit fraud by renting their kids
	as dependents to people on taxes. The DSS agency should make all receipts of help show a tax return
	and should be verified through a quick on line tax return check that it was filled with the IRS.

	 One person I know who is guilty of renting
	her kids out is Tammy (Ezzell) Dillion. Tammy allows her mother Bonnie Ezzell of
	822 Stone Street, Haw River NC 27258, Bonnie phone 336-578-5065 to claim her kids as dependents on
	tax returns while DSS pays Tammy Housing, receives Medicaid, food stamps and other various
	help from DSS for her family while tammy and bonnie ezzell commit tax fraud so Tammy can get
	more money out of the Government and that her mother would not owe taxes to the irs. her Mother
	 If the IRS had wanted to do a serious AUDIT on Tammy and her Mother than they would
	 a) contact Alamance County DSS at 336-570-6570 and have them copy there records
	and submit them to do an audit on Bonnie Ezzell and Tammy Dillion. B) contact Alamance county school board and get
	all of Draco Dill ions school background to check which school he has attended and the address they used to
	get him into those schools (School Board of Alamance county phone # 336-570-6060).

	If the IRS had verified any documents that was sent to them and verified with DSS information they could prove
	easily that the above named people have committed tax fraud. With the age of computers anyone can do up
	documents from home and no one would be the wiser about it if they came from a school, dss or a persons home
	computer without verifying from the source the validation of such documents. DSS Graham Housing during some

Comment: Gov. Perdue, thank you for signing the new law that will permit magistrates with a Right-to-Carry permit, and with some additional training, to carry concealed firearms into courthouses while on official business. I believe this represents a positive step by removing one of the arbitrary restrictions on where certain Right-to-Carry permit holders may carry firearms for personal protection. Thanks again for allowing magistrates to protect themselves and for not infringing their second amendment rights. Deb Sefton

	If you want this to stop and see reform to help reduce tax fraud please send a copy of this to the following
	your congressman, govenor and the president of the United States. All DSS receipts should have to
	follow the laws and should show proof they are doing what they are suppose to do and file a tax return
	And part of receiving help from dss should be showing proof you file taxes each year. The amount you file also
	would be used as a way to verify income for the year before for people receiving welfare and help fight fraud.
	Please forward this to as many people as you know so they too can pass this along.

Subject: [Aid4Mail Trial tag #650] Enact legislation to protect employees from bullying
Content-Type: text/plain

Governor Bev Perdue
Office of the Governor
20301 Mail Service Center
Raleigh, NC 27699-0001

Dear Governor Perdue,

Fifty-four million Americans report being bullied at work --
that's 37 percent of the workforce.

Workplace bullying is a public epidemic that is easily
overlooked. It can include verbal abuse, offensive behaviors
that are intimidating or humiliating, and sabotage that
interferes with work.

The recession makes it harder to find a new job when bullying
gets out of hand. And working with a bully in the office can be
very taxing. Bullying is a form of psychological violence that
can cause stress, depression and even suicide.

I fully encourage you to enact legislation in our state that
will protect employees from bullying in the workplace.




Sincerely,
Nichols Malpass
2226 Harden Circle
Hendersonville, NC 28739

Vote No on this bill. Please look at the medical requirements that the Government is asking for. First, i believe it is a direct Hippa violation, because this will make it a public record. Second, People need to protect themselves, look at the Government gun control in Australia and why the wonder how the crime rate is climbing. Look at Germany when Hitler took guns away from the Jews they where slaughtered, they had no way to protect themselves. Just this last year a man here in the US was sent back to Germany for these very crimes. I say to you STOP and VOTE NO or our Constitution does not mean anything our fore fathers fought for.

	To Whom it may Concern:

	I know several people who receive help from DSS (Department of Social Services).
	These people like to do rent a kid. Basically they ask family or friends
	to split tax return with them and their kids become their family or friends dependents
	for the year. They receive help from DSS and on top of that they commit fraud by renting their kids
	as dependents to people on taxes. The DSS agency should make all receipts of help show a tax return
	and should be verified through a quick on line tax return check that it was filled with the IRS.

	If you want this to stop and see reform to help reduce tax fraud please send a copy of this to the following
	your congressman, govenor and the president of the United States. All DSS receipts should have to
	follow the laws and should show proof they are doing what they are suppose to do and file a tax return
	And part of receiving help from dss should be showing proof you file taxes each year. The amount you file also

would be used as a way to verify income for the year before for people receiving welfare and help fight fraud.
Please Email your local state government reps to see changes take place.

	You can also forward this to as many of your friends who may be willing to see DSS and Tax Reform

The future of education should remain within the rights of the parents, and not changed to become the rights of the government.

Subject: Rules about pets on restaurant patios

Comment: This concerns rules about dogs being allowed on patios of restaurants that are being tightened. Please encourage Mr. Larry Michael and others in the Food Protection Branch of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to relax rather than tighten the rules. Weâve been enjoying day-trips to state parks with our dog. Lately, weâve found many pet-friendly restaurants that weâd like to continue to patronize. Iâm sure the owners and staff value our business. However, if we canât bring our dog, we wonât be able visit them again. Mr. Michael gave health concerns as the reason for tightening the rules, but they seem far-fetched. Many people share their homes with pets, and donât get sick. In Europe, pets are allowed indoors at bars and restaurants. Unless there is compelling evidence that pets pose health risks when visiting restaurant patios, the state should allow restaurant owners to decide whether to welcome them. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

	To Whom it may Concern:

	I know several people who receive help from DSS (Department of Social Services).
	These people like to do rent a kid. Basically they ask family or friends
	to split tax return with them and their kids become their family or friends dependents
	for the year. They receive help from DSS and on top of that they commit fraud by renting their kids
	as dependents to people on taxes. The DSS agency should make all receipts of help show a tax return
	and should be verified through a quick on line tax return check that it was filled with the IRS.

	If you want this to stop and see reform to help reduce tax fraud please send a copy of this to the following
	your congressman, govenor and the president of the United States. All DSS receipts should have to
	follow the laws and should show proof they are doing what they are suppose to do and file a tax return
	And part of receiving help from dss should be showing proof you file taxes each year. The amount you file also
	would be used as a way to verify income for the year before for people receiving welfare and help fight fraud.

	You can also forward this to as many of your friends who may be willing to see DSS and Tax Reform

Subject: Undocumented Immigrants and Community College Admissions

Comment: In the Sept 17th edition of the Greensboro News-Record, I read with interest a story regarding a proposal being considered by the State Community College Board that would enable undocumented immigrants to attend NC community colleges at the out-of-state tuition rate. I realize that any action by the Board to adopt such a policy would still move into consideration by the General Assembly and its statutory authority. I also read with interest Gov. Perdue's comments regarding such a proposal. My question is as follows: Has no one addressed the fact that, currently, high school-aged undocumented students are potentially eligible to attend an early college high school on a community college campus? As I understand, undocument immigrant high school-aged students are eligible to attend public high school. Presumably, they would be eligible to be considered for attendance at an early college high school. If chosen for a seat in an early college high school, the student would be taking community college courses as a part of the high school program. The aim of the early college high school program is to enable students to complete programs that result in the award of both a high school diploma and an associate degree. Thus, in such a scenario, isn't it possible for undocumented immigrant students to attend the community college through this provision? I've not heard anyone address this issue as a potential 'loophole' that would clearly enable undocumented students to attend a community college. I would appreciate having someone review this matter to determine how best to make the information known to the public. Thank you.

	To Whom it may Concern:

	I know several people who receive help from DSS (Department of Social Services).
	These people like to do rent a kid. Basically they ask family or friends
	to split tax return with them and their kids become their family or friends dependents
	for the year. They receive help from DSS and on top of that they commit fraud by renting their kids
	as dependents to people on taxes. The DSS agency should make all receipts of help show a tax return
	and should be verified through a quick on line tax return check that it was filled with the IRS.

	One person I know who is guilty of rentingher kids out is Tammy(Ezzell)Dillon. Tammy allows Bonnie Ezzell of
	822 Stone Street, Haw River NC 27258, Bonnie phone 336-578-5065 to claim her kids as dependents on
	tax returns while DSS pays Tammy Housing, receives Medicaid, food stamps and other various
	help from DSS for her family while tammy and bonnie ezzell commit tax fraud so Tammy can get
	more money out of the Government and that her mother would not owe taxes to the irs.
	 If the IRS had wanted to do a serious AUDIT on Tammy Dillon and Bonnie Ezzell they would
	 a) contact Alamance County DSS at 336-570-6570 and have them copy there records
	and submit them to do an audit on Bonnie Ezzell and Tammy Dillon. B) contact Alamance county school board and
	get all of Draco Dill ions school background to check which school he has attended and the address they used to
	get him into those schools (School Board of Alamance county phone # 336-570-6060).

	If the IRS had verified any documents that was sent to them and verified with DSS information they could prove
	easily that the above named people have committed tax fraud. With the age of computers anyone can do up
	documents from home and no one would be the wiser about it if they came from a school, dss or a persons home
	computer without verifying from the source the validation of such documents. DSS Graham Housing during some
	of these years paid for Tammy, Draco, and Kyra housing and a letter from them alone would prove tax fraud. If Irs
	would place a few calls and validate information instead of just assuming documents submitted are accurate and
	done by the agency and not on someone homes computer.

	Dracko year 2003/2004 (kindergarten) Went to Eastlawn Elemantary Cause they were homeless when he started school.
	HILLCREST Dracko Attended school here 2004,2005,2006,2007 they lived on Somer's Ave, Rent
	was paid for at the address by Graham or burlington Housing
	1714 W Davis Street Burlington NC 27215 (336) 570-6120 Hillcrest Contact INFO .
	2007-2008, 2008-2009 Dracko Went to Hawriver Elentary School (4th, 5th grade)

	Graham Housing paid for Tammy Dillon housing for many years
	DSS Contact Info: 319 N Graham HopeDale Road STE C Burlington NC 27217, Phone 336-570-6532

	The IRS need to audit Bonnie Ezzell back 7 yrs and bump the years that she claimed tammy and any of tammy kids
	against DSS of Alamance County records and Alamance county school board records of where dracko went to school.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am vehemently against this proposal. While NC is suffering high unemployment and community colleges being over-populated already, how can you permit this to come about  to the legal citizens of this state.

This is WRONG. Allowing criminals, after all they are NOT here legally, to take advantage of the system, when good law abiding people are suffering. What is the point of having laws that can be arbitrarily enforced depend on how much money can be made. Law is law and greed is greed. This is greed.

Please appeal to common decency and uphold the law.

Are you kidding me Mrs. Purdue? You are allowing illegal imigrants to go to our community colleges? They are breaking the law and you have put your stamp of endorsement on there college registrations. What are you thinking? You will not be re-elected to represent our state. So, if you have any other bright ideas, you better get them done quickly. Your days of North Carolina Govenor are over at the end of this term. I will work hard to make sure of that. You take from our disabled children and now from are abled kids too. Shame on you. Shame on you.

Comment: Hello, I would like to know Governor Perdue's position on Nuclear Power. More cores could easily be added to the Sharon Harris nuclear power plant, it was designed to have four, but red tape and nuclear demonization allowed only for 1. If three more cores were added to Sharon Harris multiple coal power plants would be able to be closed. North Carolina is in the position to become a leader in reducing carbon emissions.

Subject: Negotiations with Michell Hicks

Comment: Dear Governor, It has come to my attention that you have opened discussions with Chief Michell Hicks over Tribal Gaming on the Qualla Boundary. It has also been found that Chief Hicks is protecting white men operating bear pits in Cherokee. Yes, these are the same 'zoos' that prohibited Bob Barker from bringing cameras into their establishments. Why? Maybe they didn't want the public to see the sick and starving creatures they offer up for viewing. There are pictures posted on my website of these 'zoos' where the flesh is literally hanging off the faces of the bears. Negotiate with Hicks at your own risk, because there is a growing movement against all that encourage this carnage. I supported you in the last election, but if you meet with Hicks while this issue remains unresolved, I will vote for a yellow dog before I will support you again. BTW, my website boasts a membership of 1,121 at this moment. They are mostly people who live in WNC. And they might listen to me. Good Luck, William E. Kilian III

Dear Governor Perdue,

Your attention to the affairs of Hatteras Island is appreciated.  The presentation about wind mills met with majority agreement. 

We have been severely injured economically the last two years.  The closing of the most important beach areas of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore Recreational Area has caused visitors to go elsewhere and residents to lose their jobs. The official name for Cape Hatteras, including "Recreational Area" , was given by Congress and stands as the major purpose intended for use by the public and economic development of the area.  Following this designation, Cape Hatteras has prospered, The villages have grown and the beaches are more heavily used.  

A study being done by Fish and Wildlife and NC State University is cited in the link given below.  The article includes this quote:

Many waterbirds fled the beaches to escape increased human disturbance. They retreated to small soundside islands created from dredge material excavated while maintaining navigational channels. By the late 1970's, -erosional forces and changes in dredging practices had whittled away much of these refuges, leaving no choice for the birds but to return to ocean beaches.

Birds of interest have not reproduced successfully on the Cape Hatteras Beaches.  The only listed bird, the threatened Piping Plover, has produced at the most only 7 fledglings.  Storms and predators have taken most of the nests and fledglings every year.  The beaches are not hospitable to birds.  The dredge islands are.  Only the state can address this problem with the creation of dredge islands.  Birds and the economy will benefit.

Your attention to restoring and even expanding this former dredging in the sound would not only help the birds but the economy of the island.  This is something the State of North Carolina can do for us.
