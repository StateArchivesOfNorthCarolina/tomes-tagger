Dear Governor Perdue,

Please vote against Senate Bill 567.

This bill would define a specific energy efficiency technology
as a source of renewable energy, which if passed would undo the
state's renewable energy goals. This bill is totally unnecessary
given that the state already has an energy efficiency target.

S567 would allow big utilities to meet renewable energy goals
with only energy efficiency. This concession will further North

promote our transition to clean, renewable sources of energy. We

Raleigh, NC 27699-0001

Dear Governor Perdue,

As your constituent, I hope that you will oppose SB 567.

 We need energy efficiency, but we need renewable energy too.
Why can't we do both?

Do we want to be phase out fossil fuel, improve air quality &
health for all NC citizens and create jobs? Or do we want to
continue to rely on plowing tops off mountains in neighboring
states, code orange & red days, increased respiratory disease &
maintaining the status quo vs taking advantage of the RE Ctr at
Appalachian State & other similar resources? I vote for the
later. 

I understand that energy efficiency is a definite part of
conserving energy, but this is something that we should have
been doing since the 70's & is not a stand alone. It needs to be
one in a portfolio to self-sufficiency, which includes
renewables. I've been using cfl's for over 10 years, unplug
small appliances & have my tv, dvd player, etc. on a power trip
that is off unless it is being used. We buy Energy Star
appliances. I would have solar if it wasn't so expensive on the
front end.

Below is my opinion where SB 567 falls short, therefore why I
oppose & urge you to do the same. I'll follow this with my
reading between the lines.

REPS to only 12.5% by 2021 & beyond is laughable. I bet if
utilities were faced w/significant fines to reach this goal by
2012 that they'd find a way to meet it. As the number of
renewables facilities come on line the % of energy efficiency
should decrease & not increase. If more renewables facilities
are being utilized then utilities don't need to be more
efficient since by nature renewables are more efficient &
ultimately fossil fuels are being phased out. I think it's not
unreasonable to mandate that fossil fuel plants should be phased
out either at 1 per 10 years or within 7 years of a renewables
plant opening. If we don't have a plan to phase out ff plants
then we'll never build renewables plants & health, air quality,
etc. will suffer.

There should be no power coming into the state. We've got some
of the best sources in the US for wind power here in WNC. Why
not take advantage of what we already have at our disposal. In
Jackson Co. they pull methane from their landfill to power
greenhouses and potters studios. App State houses the federal
Solar Data Center. Why do we have all of these projects & still
rely on outdated fossil fuels? Along the same thought process,
why import renewables power from outside of NC? Why help people
in other states have a better quality of life? If renewables
plants are built here in NC then 100s-1000s of people are
possibly employed in these stages:

design - architecture, engineering material manufacturing
transportation grading labor managing & maintenance

To me this is a better solution & one that would also increase
tax revenue. Could also put NC on the map as a leader in the
renewables market & renewables technology.

My between the lines. Fletcher Hartwell's law firm represents
Duke Energy & Public Service Co. of NC whose parent is SCANA
another energy company. Do he & his clients have the interests
of NC citizens as their main concern? He may, but Duke & Public
Service Co. of NC do not. If they did they would already be
working on renewables facilities in NC & would already have one
running. Why do we as citizens get the raw end of the deal when
we are the ones who elect public officials? Companies &
businesses do not elect public officials, but they do influence
them. I think that often business gets heard above citizens. My
opinion & am guessing most other NC citizen's opinions is that
putting business before citizens is wrong. You serve us all, not
corporations & business exclusively. 

These companies do not want to spend the money on bringing
renewables to the market, because they'll have to spend an
extraordinary amount of money. It's no different than me
spending money on solar for my house. 

Please make the right choice and give renewables the opportunity
to be a part of o

Dear Governor Perdue,

Please oppose Senate Bill 567.

Each month we pay a special surcharge to the electric company
for Green Energy for renewable energy. I do NOT support or want
YOU to support any bill including S567 that allows the utility
corporations to continue to foul up our air, pollute our waters,
or continue to mine and use coal or nuclear energy for producing
power. 

I want our legislature and our state government to become known
for its GREEN ENERGY SOLUTIONS, GREEN ENERGY JOBS, SOLAR POWER
AND WIND PRODUCING POWER AND FOR GREEN MANUFACTURING JOBS! THAT
IS WHAT NC NEEDS!

Two years ago the state legislature passed comprehensive new
goals for renewable energy in North Carolina. But if the
legislature passes Senate Bill 567, our state targets for new
renewable energy generation will be ruined just when clean
energy and green jobs are essential to economic recovery.

Take the POWER away from Progress Energy and Duke Power and give
the POWER to the people with GREEN ENERGY PRODUCTION JOBS, WHERE
IT BELONGS. 

The state can stress energy conservation and stress this to the
people. Show us how and lead the way by example!

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing to urge you to oppose Senate Bill 567.

We need energy efficiency, but we need renewable energy too.
Please do not allow this energy efficiency technology to count
as a renewable energy source. We not only need to cut down on
the amount of energy we use, and use the energy we have more
effectively, but we also need our energy to come from cleaner,
renewable sources.

Dear Governor Perdue,

As your constituent, I hope that you will oppose SB 567.

While smart grid energy efficiency technology is a good idea, it
is not a source of renewable energy. If passed as written,
Senate Bill 567 would totally undermine the state's renewable
energy standard.

I cannot believe in this year of major distress that the legislature and governor are considering raising taxes (again).  Where does it stop?  In tough times, we regular folks have to make hard choices  and cut back.  We don’t have some magic “tax” that will help us.  You even tax my unemployment benefits.  Now you are thinking of raising the sales tax by 1% along with an income tax surcharge because (luckily) my husband still has a decent job.  I am not satisfied that all was done to cut back and streamline as much as possible.  It seems to me we elect you people to do what is necessary and make the tough choices, especially now.  Come election time, my vote will be for the “other guy”.  Step up!!

This bill would define a specific energy efficiency technology

Dear Governor Perdue,

Please oppose Senate Bill 567.

Two years ago the state legislature passed comprehensive new
goals for renewable energy in North Carolina. But if the
legislature passes Senate Bill 567, our state targets for new
renewable energy generation will be ruined just when clean
energy and green jobs are essential to economic recovery.

Dear Governor Perdue,

As your constituent, I hope that you will oppose SB 567.

While smart grid energy efficiency technology is a good idea, it
is not a source of renewable energy. If passed as written,
Senate Bill 567 would totally undermine the state's renewable
energy standard.

This is a pretty simple matter of definition. Renewable energy
applies to energy derived from a source which is able to
replenish itself if harvested at an equal rate. This includes
wood, if trees are planted at the same rate they are cut down;
solar, which is naturally always present; as well as others like
wind and geothermal. However, smart-grid technology does not
fall into this category any more than caulk to seal in air
conditioning does. It isn't an energy source at all, but simply
a method of improving efficiency. It's certainly a good thing,
but terms are legally defined for this very reason: that
loopholes cannot be created to cheapen the costs of legislation
to large corporations and companies. I hope this is an easy
enough issue to resolve.

Thanks for your time.


Sincerely,
Samuel Wilson
