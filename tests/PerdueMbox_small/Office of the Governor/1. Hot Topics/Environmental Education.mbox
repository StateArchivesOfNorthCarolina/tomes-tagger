Subject: Please do not eliminate Office of Environmental Education

Comment: April 2, 2009 Governor Bev Perdue Office of the Governor 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Purdue: Your proposed budget includes some very tough decisions to reduce several million dollars of state spending. However, in one area, the budget clearly throws out the baby with the bathwater: The Office of Environmental Education, within the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, is a small state office that accomplishes mountains of work on a shoestring. The proposed budget completely eliminates this office, for a savings of $377,000 in the current year. I understand the need for cutbacks, but completely dismantling a highly successful, model program is the wrong strategy for addressing the current budget constraints. Once dismantled, it will take years of legislative effort to re-establish this important office and the programs it provides. Environmental Education is important for both social and economic reasons: 1) With drop rates continuing to increase and our economy rapidly changing, it is critical that young people stay in school, succeed in math and science, and position themselves for productive adult lives. Environmental Education provides relevancy, authentic learning, and an engaging context for the knowledge and skill development students need. Teachers who are skilled environmental educators, regardless of their content area or grade level, serve their students better by using the best practices learned in EE training â€“ training they receive in part through the work of the Office of Environmental Education. 2) It is widely agreed that an environmentally literate citizenry is critical for the health and quality of life of people across the state. Environmental literacy enables citizens to make informed lifestyle choices, and opens doors for both children and adults to become volunteers and community leaders to protect our land, water, and air. Environmental literacy develops the business innovators that will lead us in the new Green economy, developing the new industries and jobs that will be the foundation of our future prosperity. 3) Protecting our precious natural resources in turn leads to increased tourism, economic development, protection and enhancement of property values, and increased business interest on a national level. Our fast pace of population growth is evidence that natural resources are a top sales factor in drawing business and retirement dollars to our state. Although times are tough right now, in a few years, as we climb out of this recession, we will regret sacrificing environmental protection for short-term benefits. The Office of Environmental Education is a critical player in developing an environmentally literate citizenry in North Carolina. Through programs, services, and information, the Office supports the efforts of hundreds of environmental educators across the state, providing a ripple effect that is exponentially more valuable than the $377,000 it takes to operate. Here are just a few examples of OEEâ€™s accomplishments: â€¢ OEE promotes the state's 187 Environmental Education Centers. 20 million people visit annually. â€¢ Thousands of teachers, park rangers, nature center staff, and others rely on the Environmental Education Certification program for quality, cost-efficient job training. 832 have completed the process; 766 are currently enrolled. For many, this certification is a job requirement, so the program has a direct impact on employment. â€¢ Each year, grants provide classroom teachers (228 teachers, representing 111,000 students so far) with a week-long coastal institute. â€¢ The OEE grants program has provided avenues for new funding for environmental education programs across the state. This translates into not only continued and improved services for citizens, but jobs as well. â€¢ The Office of Environmental Education has been a valuable resource in my personal work as a watershed coordinator. OEE provides information, maps, river basin statistics, and other resources that I have disseminated in programs over the last five years as part of a comprehensive effort to increase citizen knowledge of water quality issues and engage landowners in on-the-ground projects to improve water quality. In addition, OEE maintains a clearinghouse of information on other environmental topics to which I constantly refer constituents. â€¢ For a comprehensive list of the breadth and depth of work this office does on very little funding, please see http://www.eenorthcarolina.org/aboutus.htm. The NC Office of Environmental Education was established in 1993, and for the past 15 years has been a model that other states emulate. Recently, North Carolina won the bid to host the annual international conference of the North American Association for Environmental Education in 2011. Raleigh was selected as the conference site due in part to North Carolinaâ€™s history as a national leader in environmental education. What a shame to have our model state office closed permanently, just to meet budget shortfalls for a year or two. In addition, Federal legislation that is currently pending in Congress proposes millions of dollars of new funding for environmental education, to be allocated through grants to the states (see nclicoalition.org). By dismantling the Office of Environmental Education, we will sacrifice our strong position of being a likely recipient of portions of those funds. While the proposed budget indicates that the OEEâ€™s duties will be divvied up among several agencies, it is impossible that the work of this office will continue to be carried out in an effective way. Reorganizing/eliminating this office will not work: it is the focus of the small staff diligently working together with a common mission and collaborating with others in the state that has made it so successful and exponential in its outreach. Eliminating the Office of Environmental Education is like tearing down a building that is too expensive to operate in winter, rather than just turning off the lights and water, to be re-opened in the spring. This is over-kill. I understand that all state programs may need to reduce operational budgets in the current economic crisis, but please do not sacrifice long-term benefits for short-term results. Keep the Office of Environmental Education intact. I would like to invite you to view the value and importance of environmental education by joining my Kids-in-the-Creek program on Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday, April 28, 30, or May 1, at Apple Valley Middle School in Henderson County. We would be honored to share with you this highly acclaimed program that engages students in real-world science, builds interest and affinity for natural resources, and introduces career possibilities, while also fulfilling state curriculum requirements. The Office of Environmental Education is a critical resource for participating teachers following the program. If you will take time to join us, I would be delighted to share more about our programs, the value of the Office of EE, and the importance of this work to the children and adults of North Carolina. Please ask your staff to contact me to arrange details. And please work to ensure that the Office of Environmental Education continues to be funded, at least at a basic level, so that it can quickly revert to full operations when the economy improves. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Diane Silver Environmental Educator Past President, Environmental Educators of North Carolina Extension Agent 104 Pershing Road Asheville, NC 28805 828 298 7084 diane@diane-silver.com

Dear Governor Perdue,



I am strongly opposed to the elimination of the Office of Environmental Education (EE) in DENR. This office has personally helped me in my efforts to implement environmental education at Winston-Salem State University. Students at WSSU often come underprepared in the sciences and usually have little knowledge about human impacts on the environment and sustainable use of our natural resources. Additionally, our students who are preparing to be teachers need to be well versed in environmental education so that they can help to break the cycle of ignorance in these areas.



The Office of EE has been an incredibly valuable resource for me in this endeavor. For example, in 2003, when I first informed the Office about my desire to initiate an environmental education program at WSSU, the staff immediately took a personal interest in it. They offered to come to my campus (free of charge) to make a presentation about EE to faculty and administration. I was excited about the possibility of leveraging a state-level office to persuade my colleagues to support an important addition to our curriculum. Four staff members (including the Director) of the Office of EE came to WSSU and made a two hour presentation to the Teacher Education Council of our School of Education. I was not surprised to see that most of my colleagues knew little about the scope and value of EE. The presentation resulted not only in their becoming more knowledgeable about EE, but also helped to garner their support for my efforts to make EE a part of the teacher-preparation curriculum. As a result, I have established environmental education courses and am currently in the process of developing a Second Course of Study in Environmental Education for our teacher education candidates. The Office of EE has continued to provide me with resources, materials, and personal assistance on an ongoing basis.



The Office of Environmental Education will also be a valuable resource for future initiatives at WSSU. Last summer, several of my colleagues from a variety of disciplines joined together to develop an environmental studies degree program at WSSU. Expected to be implemented in Fall 2010, this program is proposing to have three specialization tracks: environmental education, environmental entrepreneurship, and environmental policy. This program directly addresses the University of North Carolina’s UNC Tomorrow initiatives: 4.6: Our environment, 4.1: Our global readiness, and 4.3: Our Children and Their Future: Improving Public Education. It addresses the need for increasing the environmental literacy of our teacher education candidates as well as providing them with additional science coursework, preparing students to compete in the sustainable development sector of the global marketplace, and preparing students to make informed decisions about environmental policy. WSSU would be the first HBCU in North Carolina to offer such an undergraduate degree program, and thus meet important needs of underserved populations. The Office of EE will serve a key role in the development and implementation of this program. It will provide critical ongoing support and current, high-quality educational materials.



At the national level, the North American Association for Environmental Education (NAAEE) has recognized the outstanding performance of the Office of EE. You have already received a letter of support from Brian Day, NAAEE’s Executive Director. NAAEE has scheduled its annual International Conference for 2011 to be held in Raleigh, and it would be a travesty if the Office of EE were not there to spearhead the representation of North Carolina.



In reference to our distressed economy, at a time when economists agree that the environment will be a key sector in the economic recovery, it is incomprehensible that this office would be eliminated. On the contrary, it should receive greater importance so that it can further support recovery efforts. It defies logic that this office should be eliminated for economic or budgetary reasons.



Neither Winston-Salem State University nor the State of North Carolina can afford to lose this valuable resource. I certainly could not sustain my efforts in environmental education without the help of the Office of EE. Please do not allow the Office of Environmental Education to be eliminated.



Thank you for your consideration in this very important matter.



Sincerely,

Himanshu Gopalan

Dear Governor Perdue,

I recently learned about a disturbing proposal to eliminate the
NC Office of Environmental Education. This office sustains the
environmental education community in North Carolina and we
cannot afford to let it be dismantled. By operating as a
clearinghouse and networking community for environmental
education programs this program helps connect children and
adults to nature all over the state and right in our backyard.

We can not afford to lose the Environmental Education
Certification Program, the Love A Tree Program, and the
Association of Environmental Education Centers.

In addition to national leadership in establishing environmental
education as a well-recognized profession, the office's programs
have brought prestige, job opportunities, and significant grant
funding to North Carolina.

Please oppose closing the Office of Environmental Education and
help support educational programs for children and adults to
help improve our quality of life and protect our environment. At
a time when "nature deficit disorder" is running rampant, we can
not afford to sacrifice environmental education in North
Carolina.

Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I write concerning a proposal to eliminate the North Carolina
Office of Environmental Education. This strikes me as an
extremely bad idea. The general lack of understanding of
environmental issues in our community is leading us down a path
towards a greatly diminished quality of life. We seem to be
headed towards a future in which we are surrounded by litter.
Our communities are currently being overrun by exotic plants
which are wreaking havoc with our native ecosystems. This is
absolutely not the time to deal a blow to environmental
education.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I recently learned about a disturbing proposal to eliminate the
NC Office of Environmental Education. This office sustains the
environmental education community in North Carolina and we
cannot afford to let it be dismantled. By operating as a
clearinghouse and networking community for environmental
education programs this program helps connect children and
adults to nature all over the state and right in our backyard.

We can not afford to lose the Environmental Education
Certification Program, the Love A Tree Program, and the
Association of Environmental Education Centers.

In addition to national leadership in establishing environmental
education as a well-recognized profession, the office's programs

Governor Perdue, thank you in advance for helping us congratulate my Rudie!


Today is a great day and I want to share the news with anyone who is a proud American.  Ten years ago I married a wonderful man from the Netherlands (Holland). Finally after much paperwork, waiting,  interviews and traveling to the immigration offices MANY times, he has passed the citizenship tests and is approved for citizenship of the United States.  This is a wonderful event and we are so happy and proud.  He had to answer very detailed civis questions about the US and he answered EVERY question correctly.



As a SURPRISE to Rudie I want to have a "card shower" at his celebration party.  I am asking everyone I know to forward this email to EVERYONE they know and to request that they also forward this email around the web.  It is my desire to have greeting cards, postcards or notes mailed from all over the united states and beyond, congratulating Rudie on becoming a United States citizen.  I know this is a lot to ask of people in these busy times but it would mean the world to me to share this occassion and surprise him with this.  Please snail mail a note of congratulation or express your patriotism but please take a moment and help us make this a momentus occasion for Rudie by mailing a card or note no later than May 20th to:



Mr. Rudie Klein
PO Box 746
Williamston,  NC 27892-0746



Thank you so much and please forward this to everyone you know and ask them to do the same! God bless you and God Bless America!

Office of the Governor

Raleigh, NC 27699-0001

Dear Governor Perdue,

I recently learned about a disturbing proposal to eliminate the
NC Office of Environmental Education. This office sustains the
environmental education community in North Carolina and we
cannot afford to let it be dismantled. By operating as a
clearinghouse and networking community for environmental
education programs this program helps connect children and
adults to nature all over the state and right in our backyard.

We can not afford to lose the Environmental Education
Certification Program, the Love A Tree Program, and the
Association of Environmental Education Centers.

In addition to national leadership in establishing environmental
education as a well-recognized profession, the office's programs
have brought prestige, job opportunities, and significant grant
funding to North Carolina.

Please oppose closing the Office of Environmental Education and
help support educational programs for children and adults to
help improve our quality of life and protect our environment. At
a time when "nature deficit disorder" is running rampant, we can
not afford to sacrifice environmental education in North
Carolina.

Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I recently learned about a disturbing proposal to eliminate the
NC Office of Environmental Education. This office sustains the
environmental education community in North Carolina and we
cannot afford to let it be dismantled. By operating as a
clearinghouse and networking community for environmental
education programs this program helps connect children and
adults to nature all over the state and right in our backyard.

We can not afford to lose the Environmental Education
Certification Program, the Love A Tree Program, and the
Association of Environmental Education Centers.

In addition to national leadership in establishing environmental
education as a well-recognized profession, the office's programs
have brought prestige, job opportunities, and significant grant
funding to North Carolina.

Please oppose closing the Office of Environmental Education and
help support educational programs for children and adults to
help improve our quality of life and protect our environment. At
a time when "nature deficit disorder" is running rampant, we can
not afford to sacrifice environmental education in North
Carolina.

Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I recently heard about a very disturbing proposal to eliminate
the NC Office of Environmental Education. This office sustains
the environmental education community in North Carolina and we
cannot afford to let it be dismantled. 

Science education is essential to maintaining US leadership in
the world. By using the world around us to make science real,
environmental education is making great inroads in improving
students' motivation and understanding of key principles which
then enable them to move into more advanced learning. Also, by
operating as a clearinghouse and networking community for
environmental education programs this program helps connect
children and adults to nature all over the state and right in
our backyard.

In addition to national leadership in establishing environmental
education as a well-recognized profession, the office's programs
have brought prestige, job opportunities, and significant grant
funding to North Carolina. We cannot afford to lose the
Environmental Education Certification Program, the Love A Tree
Program, and the Association of Environmental Education Centers.

Please oppose closing the Office of Environmental Education and
help support educational programs for children and adults to
help improve our quality of life and protect our environment. At
a time when "nature deficit disorder" is running rampant, we
must not sacrifice environmental education in North Carolina.

Thank you for your consideration in this matter.
