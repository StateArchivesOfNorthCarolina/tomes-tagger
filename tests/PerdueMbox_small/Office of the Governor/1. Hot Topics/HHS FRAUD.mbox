	To Whom it may Concern:

	I know several people who receive help from DSS (Department of Social Services).
	These people like to do rent a kid. Basically they ask family or friends
	to split tax return with them and their kids become their family or friends dependents
	for the year. They receive help from DSS and on top of that they commit fraud by renting their kids
	as dependents to people on taxes. The DSS agency should make all receipts of help show a tax return
	and should be verified through a quick on line tax return check that it was filled with the IRS.

	This step would also help to catch Illegal immigrants who are receiving DSS help and to help keep
	tax fraud down which would help the state in the long run. One person I know who is guilty of renting
	her kids out is Tammy (Ezzell) Dillion. Tammy allows her mother Bonnie Ezzell of
	822 Stone Street, Haw River NC 27258, Bonnie phone 336-578-5065 to claim her kids as dependents on
	tax returns while DSS pays Tammy Housing, receives Medicaid, food stamps and other various
	help from DSS for her family while tammy and bonnie ezzell commit tax fraud so Tammy can get
	more money out of the Government and that her mother would not owe taxes to the irs. her Mother
	 If the IRS had wanted to do a serious AUDIT on Tammy and her Mother than they would
	 a) contact Alamance County DSS at 336-570-6570 and have them copy there records
	and submit them to do an audit on Bonnie Ezzell and Tammy Dillion. B) contact Alamance county school board and get
	all of Draco Dill ions school background to check which school he has attended and the address they used to
	get him into those schools (School Board of Alamance county phone # 336-570-6060).

	If the IRS had verified any documents that was sent to them and verified with DSS information they could prove
	easily that the above named people have committed tax fraud. With the age of computers anyone can do up
	documents from home and no one would be the wiser about it if they came from a school, dss or a persons home
	computer without verifying from the source the validation of such documents. DSS Graham Housing during some
	of these years paid for Tammy, Draco, and Kyra housing and a letter from them alone would prove tax fraud. If Irs
	would place a few calls and validate information instead of just assuming documents submitted are accurate and
	done by the agency and not on someone homes computer.

	Bonnie Ezzell is also guilty of cheating on her unemployment by working under the table at Cindy's Food Mart
	330 Roxboro St Haw River NC 27258 PHONE: 336-578-2924. This way she draws her full unemployment amount
	and still try to have extra money. Bonnie Ezzell believes she can cheat the system and get away with it.

	If you want this to stop and see reform to help reduce tax fraud please send a copy of this to the following
	your congressman, govenor and the president of the United States. All DSS receipts should have to
	follow the laws and should show proof they are doing what they are suppose to do and file a tax return
	And part of receiving help from dss should be showing proof you file taxes each year. The amount you file also
	would be used as a way to verify income for the year before for people receiving welfare and help fight fraud.
	Please forward this to as many people as you know so they too can pass this along.

	To Whom it may Concern:

	I know several people who receive help from DSS (Department of Social Services).
	These people like to do rent a kid. Basically they ask family or friends
	to split tax return with them and their kids become their family or friends dependents
	for the year. They receive help from DSS and on top of that they commit fraud by renting their kids
	as dependents to people on taxes. The DSS agency should make all receipts of help show a tax return
	and should be verified through a quick on line tax return check that it was filled with the IRS.

	If you want this to stop and see reform to help reduce tax fraud please send a copy of this to the following
	your congressman, govenor and the president of the United States. All DSS receipts should have to
	follow the laws and should show proof they are doing what they are suppose to do and file a tax return
	And part of receiving help from dss should be showing proof you file taxes each year. The amount you file also

would be used as a way to verify income for the year before for people receiving welfare and help fight fraud.
Please Email your local state government reps to see changes take place.

	You can also forward this to as many of your friends who may be willing to see DSS and Tax Reform
