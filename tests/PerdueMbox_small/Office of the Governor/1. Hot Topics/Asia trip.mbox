Subject: Trip to China and Japan

Comment: You need to stay home and quit wasting the tax payers money. The mansion did not need to be remodeled and you do not need to go to China and Japan. You are raising our taxes while you go have a good time. Also, I thought that travel had been cut out because of the budget. Get real Bev!

Comment: I think it's criminal that at a time when you have a furlough plan in place, you have cut spending for schools, DOT and other programs here in NC that you waste our taxpayer money on a trip to China and Japan. These trips will yield no further income for NC. Who is your economist advising you that such trips are a good thing? You really should rethink your policies. You also need to ask yourself why your approval rating continues to plummet when people here are out of work and losing their benefits while you are jetting across the world. Sometimes you just need to say NO, to wasteful spending. If we are having trouble balancing our state budget there is no justification for spending the money that could be going to state employees salaries to travel across the world. I guess when you leave office there will be another grand jury convening to find out why you spent this money overseas when people at home are hurting. I hope you enjoy your cell with Easley when you get out of office. Enjoy your 60 dollar hamburger now, you will be eating baloney courtesy of the DOC later.

Comment: You go up on taxes for all of us out of a job and everything else going up. Yet, now I hear you are going on a trip to Japan! How can you justify the expense right after this tax hike? Shame on you! We, the public want to know how every penny is spent? Can't wait until the next election. But, I'm sure you don't care, you have your benefits locked in.

Subject: 82,000 for a trip to China/Japan???? Save jobs instead!

Comment: A two-week trade trip to China and Japan in the last half of October? The state will pay about $82,000? My wife just lost her job at Mitchell Community college on 8/31/09. Actually, "ALL PART TIME'er's did! The 82,000 could have save their jobs! Can't wait for 2010/2012! Feel the wave??? Sincerely, Robert L. Houck II Secretary of Commerce Keith Crisco, who has been to China 16 times, will join Perdue on the trip, along with business leaders and regional economic developers from across the state. More than half of the costs will be covered by "non-state funds," according to Perdue's office. The state will pay about $82,000.

Comment: I just saw on the news where you are spending $80,000 on a trip to Japan. I believe it is important to promote relations between other countries but there are numerous people throughout the state who are unemployed including myself. It really bothers me to see money of this amount is being wasted, I wish I had the money to go on trips like this. Since being layed off it is all I can do to pay my $320/month insurance, school tuition and have enough left over to eat.

Subject: Trip to China

Comment: I read today in an article posted on WRAL.com that you are planning a trip to the far east to drum up business for NC. I understand from this article this trip is going to cost the State $82,000.00 and another $90,000.00 in private contributions. While I applaud the use of private contributions to help make this trip possible, I must question the over all price tag. Our local Church has conducted man missions to that region of the world with the highest cost running about $3,000.00 a person. I believe it would be irresponsible to fly anything other than coach for your flights. I also believe irresponsible for you to reside in any hotel that would not be the equivalent of a Holiday Inn, or Comfort Suite in the U.S. Meals taken in any form other than "on the go" unless in a formal dinner with a prospective investor again would simply be irresponsible. I must also question the number of delegates you've chosen to travel with. How many will be traveling with you at the expense of the State or the private contributors? I challenge the above items due to the already irresponsible spending by our General Assembly. Increasing the sales tax, cutting the hours of teachers and pulling funds from hospitals are all drastic measures. I challenge you to return from you trip having spent far less than what has been published. Our leadership needs to be looking for ways to cut down on needless spending and stop attacking easy targets such as the school system. If you are truly a leader, then lead by example. Show the General Assembly what it is to SAVE money rather than spending what it doesn't have! Respectfully, C. Ryan Willett Havelock, NC currently deployed to Iraq.

Comment: It would be a very good idea to take someone from the State Auditor's office as a part of the delegation. A great many expenses to be incurred will be unusually high. By including the Ms. Wood's office you will be able to eliminate a great many problems.

Subject: N & O article - Trip to China and Japan

Comment: Today, I read the article in the News and Observer about the upcoming trip to China and Japan. The tax-payers will partially fund this trip, according to the article, for $82,000. The article also states that "others" will go. As a tax-paying citizen, I would like the names of "others" printed in a follow-up article. The citizens have a right to know who is taking these trips. Wonder how many school books $82,000 would pay for, or how many subs, or how many teacher assistants? Relationships with other countries, while important, is not the most pressing issue at the moment, with teachers and state employees losing jobs. I would appreciate seeing "others" in print. Thank you.

	Gov. Perdue - From my perspective the China trip looks like a boondoogle that will have NO measurable impact on the NC economy... very similar to the Easley trip to Italy (also no impact).  In addition, having a law firm pay for part of the trip looks like well....a payoff. 

Looks like more of the same good old boy / good old girl NC politics. 

Enjoy your business trip (wink, wink vacation) on my dime.

                        A user with email address of jsdeacs64@atmc.net submitted the following question. 



                        This is not the time Gov. Perdue to go to China on taxpayers dollars. I  have never seen any statistics indicating how many jobs have been created by these trips.  Sounds like to me since the wives and husbands tag along it more of a site seeing vacation. You people don't live in the real world, you raise our taxes and fees, lay off state employees including teachers but I don't see any jobs created in N C- give me some numbers and then I might change my mind. You can best believe I will not vote for any Democrats next election.  Shame of all you.

Comment: I want to know why a trip to Asia is going to cost more than $80,000.00 When I could go and spend $5,000.00? Or why it is even necessary? I don't appreciate my tax dollars going for this "Wasteful" spending.Especially since I am a proud owner of a new state tax "sur-charge. I am also sure the school systems that you cut money out of could easily put better use to this money.

Subject: Visiting CHINA ??????

Comment: Who will pay for this visit when the teachers,workers, children of NC were forced to give up money promised! People have lost their jobs because of changes within the state system. I could use eye glasses, tires, and yet we remove money from people who do not make that much to begin with so I ask, WHO will foot the bill for a trip to China? Not a good time to use money for such! By the way I have always used money tightly. Those who save and spend wisely usually get the short end of the stick once again. Go ahead and give everything away and take your little trip but it better benefit the American society/ NC. If you are using your own money to visit China then I am truly sorry for this letter.

SHAME ON YOU!!!!! I was so disappointed in you when I read the newspaper article about your trip to China.  Let’s face it China can not help North Carolina’s financial problems.  We have teachers loosing their jobs, over crowded classrooms, people out of work, and the shortage of money list continues to grow.  Our state taxes were just raised and no one’s salary has increased.  What a SELFISH AND IRRESPONSIBLE ACT!!!!

Subject: Travel Expenses

Comment: According to the Durham Herald-Sun, your trip to China is estimated to cost over $80,000. maybe $88,000 . Please explain why such this trip should cost the tax payers so much. In Sept 2007 my wife and I took a 21 day tour of China, staying in 4-5 star hotels, visiting 10 cities including Beijing and Shanghai, taking a 3 1/2 day river cruise up the Yangtze. eating at good restaurants, and taking several internal flights within China. Our expenses for this tour. including a guide and including airfare from RDU to Shanghai and return cost $12,000. Your travel expenses sound exhorbitant, and you should either fully justify them or severely trim your expenses.

Gov. Perdue Focuses on Green,  Defense/Aerospace Jobs

Cree Announces 575 New 'Green' Jobs
Governor Perdue was on hand Thursday as Cree, the Durham-based maker of energy efficient LED lights, announced they were creating 575 new jobs over three years in North Carolina as they expand their manufacturing capacity.
"Green jobs are a cornerstone of my vision for building a 21st century global economy in North Carolina," Perdue said. "This job announcement fits perfectly with my plan to grow a world-leading green economy in North Carolina that turns green into gold for decades to come."
Parachute Manufacturer Brings 375 Jobs to Person County
North American Aerodynamics Inc., a national manufacturer of parachutes for military and sports uses, will expand in Person County.  The company will invest nearly $900,000 and create 375 jobs in Roxboro.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $300,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
“North Carolina, the nation’s most military-friendly state, maintains a strong manufacturing sector in support of our armed forces,” Perdue said.  “Our state’s skilled workforce and excellent business climate continue to attract growing businesses.”
North American Aerodynamics Inc., a privately held company founded in 1964, produces the globally distributed Parafoil Accuracy Parachute Canopy and parachutes for the sports and military sectors.  The company currently has 45 employees, along with 55 seasonally furloughed workers, at its headquarters and manufacturing facility in Person County.
The company, which recently secured a new military contract, plans to expand and renovate two existing nearby buildings to meet increased manufacturing demands. 
North Carolina continues to have a top-ranked business climate.  Through Gov. Perdue’s JobsNOW initiative, the state will work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain our workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.
For information on North American Aerodynamics, go to <http://naaero.com/>http://naaero.com.  For more information on job opportunities, or to submit a resume, contact Patsy Jones at <mailto:namerican.hr@gmail.com>namerican.hr@gmail.com.
Governor Attends AUSA Conference in Washington, DC
Gov. Perdue on Monday attended the Association of the United States Army conference in Washington, DC.  In an effort to grow our military/aerospace economy, Gov. Perdue spent the day meeting with companies about locating in North Carolina.  She also met with U.S. Commerce Secretary Locke regarding funding to expand broadband access - the e-NC Authority is to receive $2 million in federal funds.
Pictured here is Governor Perdue with General Dunwoody, the nation's first female four-star general.
Gov. Perdue Announces Nearly $700,000 to Expand Outreach and to Insure Children Entering School

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced that North Carolina has received a $678,210 grant to fund health insurance outreach and enrollment for eligible, uninsured children. As detailed in her health care roadmap, the governor proclaimed her goal of all children having access to coverage and making sure all eligible children are enrolled.
“When our children enter public school, we need to ensure that they are healthy and ready to learn,” said Perdue. “This partnership will help us reach out to more young children across North Carolina to make sure they are receiving the care and coverage they need.”
The North Carolina “Healthy & Ready to Learn” (HRL) Partnership will identify uninsured children who are entering kindergarten and are eligible for Medicaid or N.C. Health Choice.  In the first year, the program will be piloted in a total of 16 high need rural and urban N.C. counties with thousands of eligible and uninsured kindergartners.  In year two, the program will expand statewide to all 4 and 5 year olds. North Carolina is one of 41 states awarded funding by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
This is the third in a series of initiatives originally outlined in her health care roadmap issued during Gov. Perdue's campaign. Despite having to balance a budget deficit of $4.7 billion, Gov. Perdue has worked toward expanding health care coverage in North Carolina, including the expansion of SCHIP by 9,098 children. The governor also announced that North Carolina received $17 million from a competitive federal grant to expand coverage for uninsured working families, and nearly $3.9 million for Rural Hope, a program that will improve health care facilities in rural North Carolina.
Submit Your Suggestions to the StreetSafe Task Force

The first meeting of Gov. Perdue's <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=630>StreetSafe Task Force was on Thursday.  The task force is charged with finding ways to transition prisoners and probationers back to work instead of back to crime.
As part of the meeting members heard an overview of sentencing and recidivism in North Carolina and around the country, and they discussed their own ideas about how best to keep offenders out of prison and away from crime.  They also encourage the public to submit their own suggestions and recommendations.  You can contact the task force at <http://www.streetsafe.nc.gov/>www.streetsafe.nc.gov.
Attorney General Roy Cooper and Department of Corrections Secretary Alvin Keller co-chair the task force, which is made up of government, civic, community and law enforcement representatives.
Gov. Perdue Encourages Citizens to Provide Input for State Service Plan

Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday announced that the North Carolina Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service is asking for the public’s input on the state’s service needs for its three-year state service plan.  The Commission will feature a survey on its Web site, <http://www.volunteernc.org/>www.volunteernc.org, from Oct. 5-12th.
“I encourage North Carolina citizens to provide their input and become a part of shaping our state’s service and volunteerism goals,” said Perdue. “To create the most comprehensive plan, we need to hear as many people’s opinions on North Carolina’s human, education, environmental and public safety needs.”
The North Carolina Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service is required by law to develop a three-year state service plan to submit to the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS).  The plan is to establish and recognize the state’s priorities and address areas of community and state needs to improve lives and strengthen communities.  The 2010-2012 State Service Plan is due to CNCS in early November.
To access the survey, please visit <http://www.volunteernc.org/>www.volunteernc.org.

Governor Perdue,
Is this really the right time to go to Asia for 12 days?  The state is facing HUGE budget cuts and will be faced with more next year.  I agree that we need to expand our business market but that frankly should have been done a long time ago to realize profits for the present.
Our taxes are too high...how do we attract new businesses from foreign countries or other states?
I am so dissappointed with the decisions of this adminstration so far...not just Asia trip.  The good old boy network seems to be alive and well and shameless.  The opportunities to send a strong message about corruption and political patronage have been lost forever.  It seems business as usual in good ole NC.  
A very sad day for NC, indeed!
Safe travels to Asia!
Sincerely, 

--
