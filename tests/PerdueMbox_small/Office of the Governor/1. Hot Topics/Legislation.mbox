Subject: North Carolina Senate Bill 202, specifically Sections 27C.2(a), 27C.2(b), 27C.2(c), and 27C.2(d)

Comment: Dear Governor. Perdue, I am writing to you to express my complete and total opposition to North Carolina Senate Bill 202, specifically Sections 27C.2(a), 27C.2(b), 27C.2(c), and 27C.2(d), which can be found on pages 268 and 269 of the following document: http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2009/Bills/Senate/PDF/S202v6.pdf As my Governor I would trust in you that you can see the folly of this proposal. In order for me to adequately explain why I‚Äôm so opposed to this bill, I will need to explain a small bit about how this bill will affect me personally. I‚Äôm primarily a stay at home Mom. I have been for 8 years now. It has not been easy financially but it is something I will never regret doing as I was able to raise my own children without the need for daycares. However, like most people in today‚Äôs society, life is a struggle, especially when you are living primarily on one income (my husbands). I therefore work part time to supplement the family income. I am a professional musician and this allows me to teach private lessons from my house and also I play music gigs from time to time. In addition to this I also substitute teach occasionally in the local school system. However the main reason I‚Äôm writing to you is due to that fact that I also have a small internet based business which I set up myself a number of years ago. The website I own is called www.allaboutflutes.com I set this website up as an information tool that can be used by newcomers to learning the flute, in order to assist them in purchasing a quality instrument. I also work with an affiliate, in my case they are called Commission Junction, that helps me make sales via my website. Basically, if anyone purchases an instrument or sheet music via my website I gain some commission on the sale paid to me by Commission Junction. Let me tell you that the income I earn from this venture is not enough for me to be able to live a good life, far from it. However, it does supplement other sources of income and there is also a certain amount of pride in it as I conceived of this website myself, worked on getting it established and have constantly worked at keeping up with updating and marketing it. I pay income taxes to the State each year from any sales I make. As the website has seasoned with time it is also gaining in popularity and I had began to notice a definite trend upwards in the amount of sales I was making compared to the beginning years of this venture. However, to my dismay, earlier this week I was notified by Commision Junction that they were dropping me and all of their other North Carolina based websites from their books due to this proposed bill. They are not willing to have to pay a state sales tax to North Carolina and have therefore concentrating their business in States where this does not apply. This has therefore wiped out my web based sales 100%. I can also find no other affliliate willing to do business here, Amazon been another example in this regard. This proposal therefore has killed my venture and not only that but now the State will not receive any income tax from me on earnings that I would have made from this. This is therefore a lose-lose situation for both the State of North Carolina and me personally. While I can carry on working at my other part time jobs, I will still sorely miss this income. However, I do have two very good friends who are self employed through similar but much larger ventures than mine and they are extremely nervous now to say the least. They have also been dropped by their affiliates and have literally seen their sources of income disappear overnight. I have attached a link which has an online petition that has been circulating against this bill. I don‚Äôt know if you are aware of this petition or not. I suggest you read through some of the comments as you will see how much this will effect people and small business owners residing in your district and State http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/ncaffiliatetax/ To conclude, I think this bill is outrageous. It is going to affect my income, affect the State revenue from income taxes paid, send businesses to other more accommodating States and effectively kill off hundreds if not thousands of small business owners in this State. I am pleading with you to come out against this bill. I will, as will others small web based business owners I know, be watching your stance very carefully on this issue. This one vote will determine my allegiance for the next and future election cycles. I can promise you that support for this bill will mean you will forever lose my vote. I would also like a response from you on this issue with your thoughts on this bill. I would also greatly appreciate it if this response was not a generic response. I have received enough of them over the years every time I have tried to contact either my Federal, State or local representatives. A personal response on this issue that answers my stated concerns and states your viewpoint will be expected. Sincerely, Sharon Fogarty

Subject: Bill Signing

Comment: There is a great bill that has been delivered to the Governor for her signature. It is SB 661 which makes some great imporvements to the landlord/tenant laws. One of which is for the first time having a statewide minimal housing standard finally defining what makes a property fit and habitable. This bill is a key first step to ensuring that our low income residents do not have to live in substandard housing. I would like to know if Governor Purdue plans on signing the bill, and if she plans on having a signing ceremony? I really think she should there was a lot of hard work done by tenant advocacy groups as well as groups that support landlords to get this done. It is a prime example of what can be done when people from opposite sides of the aisle can sit down and work. I think there should be a ceremony with representatives from the Apartment Association, NC Justice Center, and NC ACORN as these were the primary groups working to make this bill a success.

Subject: Please support House Bill 1305

Comment: Amanda Leeds 13346 Calloway Glen Drive Charlotte, NC 28273-8000 July 2, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing today to ask that you please support House Bill 1305. The purpose of this bill is to fix the severely under funded Beach Plan, the state-created insurance plan for coastal homeowners. The Beach Plan currently covers $73.6 billion in property on the coast but can only pay $1.66 billion in claims. Without reform this year, a major hurricane hitting the North Carolina coast could ultimately wind up costing all North Carolina residents by: - Disrupting the insurance market which could have statewide impact on banking, real estate, economic development and employment. - Driving up insurance rates. A recent study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for all North Carolina residents. To put this into perspective ? if this shortfall were covered by state funds, it would equal $1,555 for every taxpayer in North Carolina. House Bill 1305 should stabilize the state?s coastal insurer by: ensuring that the Beach Plan has the financial resources to pay claims; providing a strategy for the Beach Plan to minimize the financial impact of a large storm; and preserving competition and availability of homeowners insurance across the entire state. In January, a legislative study committee of state lawmakers from both the coastal and inland area recognized the immediate need to fix the Beach Plan to protect the state. And the Commissioner of Insurance has repeatedly called the Beach Plan a ticking time bomb. Please support House Bill 1305 to fix the Beach Plan. Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

Subject: Veto H1305 if it comes to your desk

Comment: Dear Govenor Perdue, I am asking you to veto North Carolina House bill 1305 as it is expected to pass before our legislature goes home in about three weeks. 40 years ago our legislature created an insurance business entity called the ‚Äúbeach plan‚Äù to underwrite homeowners insurance at the beaches. The ‚ÄúBeach Plan‚Äù insurance company was suppose to be the insurer of last resort but of late it‚Äôs rates were better than some private insurers. That fact and the huge largely uncontrolled amount of beach construction have caused the plans liabilities to grow from $32 to $74 billion from 2004 to 2008. Before this H1305 bill, in the event of storm damage, private insurers would pay a pro-rata share of any claims beyond the assets of the beach plan. Now the risk is so large that private insurance have threatened to stop writing homeowners insurance unless the insurance commissioner and the legislature limit their risk. The answer our elected officials have come up with in H1305 is to limit the insurers risk to $1 billion dollars per storm and make homeowners across the state pay the rest of the bill. It would work like this; the coastal area of NC covered by the beach plan is hit by a $20 billion damage storm like Katrina. The $19 billion in claims beyond the first billion would be recouped through a 10% surcharge on every homeowner policy in the state until the $19 billion bill was paid. The insurance companies are off the hook after a billion and remember we have $74 billion of insured coastal property. I have yet been able to determine how much money insurance companies made in the last 40 years of the plan, but it sounds like the beach plan only has about $1 to 1.5 billion in reserves and around a billion in reinsurance policies. For much of the last 40 years beach homeowners appear to have not paid a significant premium increase verses the rest of the state for homeowners insurance. However, the growing amount of beach construction has recently changed that. Homeowner insurance rates in our 18 coastal counties have recently gone up significantly relative to the rest of the state. This caused the coastal areas to form a collective lobbying effort to spread the hurricane risk. They are quick to point out the damage done in the Triangle by Fran in 1996 to support their claim for spreading the risk. However, the fact remains that private insurers are not threatening to pull out of North Carolina because of hurricane risk in Charlotte or Raleigh. It is the coast and especially the close to water construction risk they are worried about. It is also a fact that nothing in this bill does anything to control the explosive beach construction growth that is going to continue to increase our coastal risk. Most of these homes are income producing rental properties and many of them are owned by people who are not residents of North Carolina. These build and rent decisions have been made in the past without a true cost of insurance figured in and will continue to be this way in the future if this bill passes. In fact, if income producing homeowners had to pay the full cost of their insurance the way other business owners do, the risk at our coast would not be as large and would have been built into our economic structure. Now we do have a system that is poised to implode. I am only willing to help finance the unwinding of this beach liability if I can see a way to fix it in the future. As this bill stands today it is only a band aid and not a fix. Please veto this bill and make the folks at the beach pay their own way. Thanks John Davis

Subject: Boating Safety S43v3

Comment: Governor Perdue, I am contacting you regarding a Boating Safety bill I am very disappointed with. I am asking you take steps to stop this form of the bill from becoming law. I request this as this version of the bill is, respectfully, a joke. How can my representatives in the state house waste time and money considering a law that doesn't have any consequences for violating the law. Really how can you consider a law with no penalty to be a law. This is an extremely watered down version of the original bill where the education requirement was phased in over time. Boating Safety is serious and should be taken seriously. This bill will not provide the needed tools to the authorities charged with maintaining safe waterways. I am an avid recreational boater and enjoy the waters of our state but there are many that take advantage of our waterways and use them recklessly. I have witnessed many boaters who are clueless about driving a boat. I've been anxiously waiting for a boating safety law in NC but not this one. Virginia has a sensible law in place. I see no harm in using the law from VA as the template for North Carolina. Please stop wasting time on laws with no effect and stop this form of the bill from becoming law. Create a boating safety law that makes sense and requires everyone to pass a boating safety course. Respectfully, Kevin Lyon

Subject: Affiliate Tax Bill

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue, My name is Sean Goodman and I am a resident of Statesville in Iredell County, NC. Until recently I was employed full time and worked on my own in the evenings trying to earn extra money through affiliate programs on the internet to help pay the bills and support my family. I lost my full time job a few weeks ago and had been counting on the little that I make through these programs to put food on the table and a roof over my family. I have been doing this for the past 2 years and although not much, I received a 1099 and reported all money earned on both my federal and state income tax. Due to this affiliate tax bill I have now been contact by 2 of my affiliate programs with a notice of immediate termination which means that I can no longer earn or generate revenue from them. I feel that this bill has not only hurt me and my family but will ultimately hurt the State of NC through a loss of income tax revenue as I am not the only affiliate marketer in the state. Many colleagues I have spoken with have even put forth the notion of moving their business out of state. I strongly urge you to do whatever is possible to prevent this bill from taking effect as it will significantly hurt many small businesses and individuals in this great state. Thank you for your time, Sean Goodman 134 Little Valley Ln. Statesville, NC 28625 704-500-2626

I am not willing to pay any additional taxes or higher energy bills to generate cleaner energy and fight global warming. I believe the great majority of citizens agree with me. We are taxed enough already. If you want to change my taxes, then lower them. This bill would actually do little, if anything, to reduce global warming. But it will have devastating impact on our nation's economy by 1. decreasing the spendable incomes of most Americans on account of having to pay higher taxes, both directly and indirectly. 2. increasing the cost of American-made products and services. 3. reducing American jobs as a result of decreased competitiveness of our products and services, thereby pushing more jobs overseas. It is myth that a significant number of "green" jobs will be created by this bill. 4. transferring wealth from higher to lower income citizens via direct subsidies to lower income people. 5. increasing the size of government. Once we start losing business to other nations as a result of this bill, Congress would undoubtedly implement duties and tariffs on imports to try to rectify our worsening trade imbalance. Short of rescinding the bill, what other action would Congress be able to take? This action will then lead to even more job loss and lower GDP growth. China, India, and many other nations will benefit from our passing this legislation. I bet that many are even hoping that we do pass it! There seems to be belief in Washington that China, India, and the rest of the world will follow our action. There is no evidence to support this. In reality, these nations want to develop themselves and catch up with the US. They require energy to accomplish this. They will not agree to follow us as that would diminish their growth. They have a vested interest in swearing off carbon restrictions, and they increasingly need the US less for their success. The only thing the US gains by acting alone is a raw deal. Whether our economy is doing well or poorly, neither this bill nor any cap-and-trade bill should ever not be passed. But especially today with our nation in severe recession, how can the Senate even consider this extremely harmful legislation? Again, please vote no. Sincerely, Tessa G.

Subject: LEA actions

Comment: I am concerned that LEA's are taking drastic measures because they are unsure what will happen with the budget. Positions are being cut everyday, high school course offerings are being deleted, monies owed to teachers are frozen by LEA's, teachers are being asked to buy their own basic supplies for the next school year, and many decisions are being made without public knowledge of how the community and education will be affected. I am concerned that by the time the legislature completes the budget it will be too late for many districts. Sincerely, Delores Wilder

Subject: Western NC Windmill Ban

Comment: I have read in the newspaper that three NC Senators, Queen, Snow, and Nesbitt have altered a bill by Senator Goss that will ban commercial windmills from Western NC. I would like to encourage the Govenor to do everything in her power to stop this ban. This ban would end the future of NC ever leading the way in clean energy and would hurt the local economies in lost jobs related to wind energy. As a fellow Democrat, I am asking the Govenor's office to look into this matter. The Democrat party has always promoted clean energy and have for too long be accused of "larger" government and here we are "shooting ourselves in the foot again." On a personal note, I live near the new Appalacian State University Windmill, and I have to say that my family and I actually enjoy driving by it and watching it turn and it does not look bad at all. I encourage Govenor Perdue to visit Boone and take a look for herself. Respectfully, Mark R. Parlier and family

Dear Representative and Senator, Senate Bill 20 would expand forced taxpayer financing of political campaigns to the office of the state treasurer. Taxpayers should not be forced to fund campaigns they disagree with. Taxpayer financing of elections also is likely unconstitutional after the recent United States Supreme Court decision in Davis v. FEC. The legislature should not be expanding these unconstitutional programs rather the General Assembly should be repealing them. Taxpayers in North Carolina can not take another burden during this economic crisis. Please vote against Senate Bill 20 and/or any bill that expands forced taxpayer support of political campaigns.

Subject: budget, Yadkin river legislation

Comment: dear Governor Perdue: I think you and the legislators should think about trimming the fat in the state education system before you raise our taxes any more than they are already. I lost 40% of my retirement savings in the last year and a half and no one in government is bailing me out or really seems to care.I have to suck it up and that's what I'm doing. No reason the college administrators and teachers shouldn't do the same. On the subject of waste SB967 the yadkin river legislation doesn't seem to be a good idea especially considering our budget deficit. Taking over Alcoas generating business seems un American and unnecessary. Thank You

teens this week by signing the Healthy Youth Act into law.

This law will bring comprehensive sex education to every school
district in North Carolina and will help our state begin to
address our high teen pregnancy and STD rates.

More than 90% of NC parents have expressed that they want
comprehensive sex ed in schools and I appreciate that you
listened to those parents, your constituents, and signed this
bill into law.

Subject: Cap & Trade has unconstitutional portions

Comment: The cap & trade that passed the house says all houses must be built to the California code; making the NC building code void. Also they are going to inspect all homes and if they don't meet thier energy conservation standards (federal) they must be upgrade and pass inspection or they can't be sold. You need to bring a law suit on behalf of NC. If this passes the senate 75% of all homes in NC will be worthless. Because NC homes that are 40 years old were built with diaganal braces in the walls making it impossible to blow insulation in the walls. As these homes are unable to be sold people will get thier home values marked down at the county level costing counties taxes. Please protect us NC citizens by filing suit against this unconstitutional law.

Subject: Senate Bill 460

Comment: I am absolutely horrified that this bill got pulled. Have you read the news lately? Do the animals really deserve this injustice? But don't let us stop the Right to Carry Permit Reform. It's okay for you to carry a gun but god forbid we protect the ones that have no voice. Every creature deserves to have the basic necessities in life just like you and I do. Good lord prisoners (murders, child molestors) have more rights than puppies and kittens do. How is that right? It's okay to murder someone and you get 3 square meals, shelter, and even education. They don't even have to live in their own filth but the puppies and kittens do because they generate revenue whereas prisoners cost money to keep their sorry butts in jails. If you don't stand up for the animals who will? You're the last stop! And really a $1,000 max fine !! That's it? No wonder it doesn't hurt them. They just create another name and may even buy the same dogs back at auction.. I hope you can sleep at night! I can't.. It's time the law starts getting tough on animal crime. We need stiffer penalties and a better inspection system. I am willing to step up but are you!

Dear Governor Perdue,

I just heard about plans for persons convicted of drunk driving to be given an additional opportunity (5)†to get their drivers licenses back.† I am totally opposed to that.† These offenders have already ignored the law too many times and put everyone's lives in danger and taken the lives of many.† A vehicle is a deadly weapon in the hands of anyone but especially in those of a drunk driver.† How could anyone want to give these drivers another opportunity to possibly kill or maim responsible individuals.†

I ask you to put the veto pen to this proposition.

Sincerely,
Victoria Sanchez

Gov. Perdue Presents Lawmakers with Pathway to Protecting Education, Core Services within a Balanced Budget

In a letter to lawmakers this week, Gov. Bev Perdue provided a pathway to a balanced budget that protects education and other core services. The pathway also calls upon budget writers to make significant cuts, to increase revenue through specific revenue increases and to take steps to modernize North Carolina‚Äôs tax code, including permanent reductions to sales, income and business tax rates.
Gov. Perdue outlined the four key principles she believes are vital to a balanced and responsible budget. The pathway incorporates aspects of existing proposals, including some from her own budget and from the House and Senate.†
‚ÄúWe must remember that the decisions we make today are not about our political future, they are about our children‚Äôs future,‚Äù she said.
The letter, sent to every Senate and House member, detailed these principles:
- Protection of education and core public safety and health care services
> - Fairness to working families
> - Modernization of the tax code with permanent rate reduction
> - Targeted tax relief

Gov. Perdue Signs Executive Orders to Increase Transparency in State Government

Gov. Bev Perdue this week†signed†Executive†Orders 17 and 18 to bring greater transparency and accountability to state government.
‚ÄúThese executive orders further expand on two hallmarks of my administration ‚Äì transparency and accountability,‚Äù said Perdue. ‚ÄúOnly when the doors of government are open wide, and the sun truly shines in, can we be sure that our government by the people is working for the people.‚Äù
<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=509>Executive Order 18 declares that executive branch emails sent to and from state government accounts will be retained and archived as public records for 10 years. Executive branch employees must keep all emails they send for at least 24 hours so that those emails can be copied to backup tapes. Emails received must also be kept for 24 hours unless the email is clearly not related to state business. The order also directs ITS to develop a new email archiving system and make it available to all executive branch agencies for which it provides email services as soon as practicable. Until the new archiving system is developed, ITS will continue to keep backup tapes of emails sent to and from state government accounts. The Governor has invited all parts of†state government over which she does not have direct control, including the legislative and judicial branches, to participate in this program.
<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=508>Executive Order 17 directs the Department of Commerce to obtain and report the names of consultants involved in economic development projects that seek benefits from the state‚Äôs incentive programs.† Information on consulting relationships will be provided to the Secretary of Commerce, the Economic Investment Committee, and the Governor to better assist them in making conflict of interest assessments and will be retained as part of each project‚Äôs file.

Hoke County Gets New Manufacturer, 40 Jobs

Alpla Inc., a global supplier of plastic packaging, is opening a new manufacturing facility in Raeford.† The company plans to invest $7.2 million and create 40 jobs during the next three years.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $120,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
‚ÄúNorth Carolina‚Äôs strong manufacturing sector is vibrant and diverse,‚Äù Perdue said.† ‚ÄúOur state‚Äôs forward-looking policies, skilled workforce and top business climate continue to attract growing companies of all sizes.‚Äù
Alpla Inc., based in Austria and with operations in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, provides bottles, caps and other plastic packaging products to clients globally.† Alpla recently posted annual sales of more than $3.2 billion, with more than 10,000 employees worldwide and production facilities in 34 countries.† The company, with its U.S. headquarters in Georgia, lists Unilever, Coca-Cola, Proctor & Gamble and Clorox among its clients.
Alpla plans to open a new manufacturing facility, its first in North Carolina, on the Raeford campus of one its major clients, Unilever Corp.† The company will manufacture plastic bottles for shampoo, conditioners and body wash products.† The 40 new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $32,450, not including benefits.† That is higher than the Hoke County average annual wage of $22,724.
North Carolina continues to have a top-ranked business climate.† Through Gov. Perdue‚Äôs JobsNOW initiative, the state will work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain our workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

‚ÄúNorth Carolina is synonymous with biomedical research, development and manufacturing,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said.† ‚ÄúOur knowledge-based workforce and top business environment ensures that this state remains attractive to innovative, growing companies like Adhezion.‚Äù

Subject: [Aid4Mail Trial tag #2857] House Bill 1617
Date: Sun, 12 Jul 2009 16:13:10 -0400

I ask the Governor and Senate to stop House Bill 1617.

After more than 20 yearsí effort and endeavor on the part of the public, local and state

government and federal agencies, and now at last the NC Turnpike Authority, the MID CURRITUCK

†SOUND BRIDGE (MCSB ) could get underway in the near future ñ as per its published schedule.

To subordinate the NC Turnpike Authority to the NCDOT at this time would slow down

the momentum recently achieved.

With the agreement with ACS Infrastructure / Dragados USA †in place, the Turnpike Authority has

†a private partner with the experience to pilot the project through the final regulatory steps, get the project

funded, privately as well as with some federal stimulus money and build the Bridge in a timely manner.

This is a time for the NC Turnpike Authority to use all its resources and know- how to keep

†this project moving.

With reduced operational capability, and a learning curve on the part of† NCDOT staff, critical time will be lost.

By maintaining the NC Turnpike Authority, its partner and targeted schedule, the MCSB could get underway

in the near future, creating jobs for the recession stricken Outer Banks and so generating needed income

for the State of NC.

When the Bridge is complete, further revenue will be generated by a surge of economic growth in the area,

in both Currituck and Dare Counties..

The loss of imminent new revenue far outweighs any savings from merging the Authority with the DOT

The NC Turnpike Authority needs to continue to function independently.

Please stop House Bill 1617



I have been a resident of the Outer Banks since 1973, doing business mainly on the Northern Beaches, Duck and Corolla.

The MCSB was needed years ago. †Even in the boom years, visitors were refusing to return to the Outer Banks

†because of the congestion on HWY 15 8 and NC 12. †††When a hurricane evacuation is ordered, the bottleneck

is 100 times worse.† It takes extra days to get people off the Banks.



Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I am sending this e-mail to voice my concerns pertaining to proposed
legislation regarding the commercial real estate industries LLC's.
This proposed tax  is extremely unfair for a myriad of reasons. Due to
the current economic climate I have more vacant leases than I have had
in my five decades of business. The aforementioned proposed
legislation will require me to double my current rate of tax on
properties that are not producing any income via rental/lease
payments. The taxes I am currently paying on properties are pushing
the window of viable business stability as it is. This proposed tax
will be a tremendous burden on my business and will directly affect my
future plans for business development, consequently depriving the
state of future taxable real estate and jobs. Lastly this proposed
legislation will deter investment in North Carolina and brand our
state as "unfriendly" to business.

Subject: Charter School's Bill #HB 316

Comment: Questions concerning the law applying to 09-10 school year, namely we have one twin who was accepted in the lottery at a Charter School and one waiting for this bill to pass. Now we are told something different. This is indeed in conflict w/ the understanding and communications we have been receiving for four months. We were given the HB 316 as a starting point that if passed would enable one of our twins to enter Raleigh Charter THIS Fall. We received relevant info from the school, been in regular contact w/ the office of Reps. Avilla and Jeffus, the Legislative Library... We heard at one point after the Senate's second reading that it may be opposed, so we called to find out what was happening. We were advised that there was NOT opposition and that it is expected to pass. Upon the passage of the law and theGov's signature, thought we were done, good to go. We spoke with Dr. Humble (RCHS principal) and shared hard copies of law and he indicated he'd speak w/ the state. He did, left a message that conflicted w/ our firm understanding and indicated we could speak w/ Jean Kruft, which we did. She was a good listener, indicated that after the Gov. signed the bill, questions arose to the potentially impacted multiple siblings that could go to school this Fall. That conversation was carried to the state Attorney General's office and an interpretation made that this new law will apply in the next lottery. Notwithstanding the logic there, we are blindsided. Prior to yesterday EVERY conversation we had reinforced the applicability that the passage of the law would allow my child (the other twin) to enroll in the school THIS year, being Fall of 2009. We are greatly disappointed and wanted to understand the protocal in this process. Not one person has indicated a sincere interest in two teenagers who have been put in limbo for months. We feel slighted as a family and feel horrible for our twins. Why was someone not upfront in the initial questioning process? We asked all the right questions and been terribly mislead on this situation. Can you in the Governor's office provide any additional insight to us. Sincerely and respectfully, Angela Finn

MEANINGLESS VOTE ON ANNEXATION
†I understand the vote option in the House Bill H524, to be a "we don't have a prayer" vote provision. How this fits into reality with forced annexations or city invitations to join their planning, please see the example using the town of Cary as an example:
The Town of Cary is a medium-sized city. Medfield Estates, a community of 400 homes, would have to collect 13,000 signatures (from registered voters only) to force a vote, and then mount a campaign to convince city residents to vote against the annexation of our neighborhood. The forms to collect petition signatures would have to be obtained from the town of Cary by a registered voter only.
Let's say there are 1,000 people in Medfield Estates. Rule out the children, the elderly and infirm from that number to determine the number of people who would have to collect 217 signatures per day to reach the goal barely in time to meet the deadline.
Based on experience with recruiting volunteers who could take on this task, there would probably be 50 people, at best, trying to collect the signatures on a part-time basis in less than two months.
In order to get the full two months to collect signatures, we would have to be watching the Cary Council closely to know that they passed a resolution of intent.
If we were somehow successful at getting the signatures needed, and all the signatures qualified as valid, we would then have to be prepared to run a political campaign at our own expense to counter the campaign using tax dollars that the city would launch at the next municipal election to defeat any chance that the vote would go against the city.
This is not giving us a fair chance at getting a vote or winning one.
In smaller towns, with fewer names required on the petition, it would not be as difficult, but not easily done either. I feel that all citizen-property-owners of North Carolina should get the same advantage of a vote, if any gets one, to be more democratic. After all, our country is set up on democracy, and citizen land owners outside of city limits have never voted for city officials or their League of Municipalities in any fashion. This is not democracy! Perhaps the Senate will do better.

PLOY INDEED ON ANNEXATION
Re: Annexation bill a ploy (Letters, July 7):
Keith Bost is correct in his analysis of Rep. Hugh Holliman's referendum amendment. Mr. Holliman barely retained his House seat in the last election, largely due to the issue of forced annexation.
We should all be encouraged, however, that "our" legislative leadership feels it necessary to resort to such as this, along with the shouted oral voting and the unamendable bill titles. Remember what happened last year to the moratorium passed by the House? Leadership in the Senate refused to allow it to come to the floor for a vote, rightly fearing that it would pass.
Along with the growing anger and frustration of the citizens fighting forced annexation is the growing support for real reform of this horrendous law.
Don't forget to thank those who have actively and publically come to our aid!

Governor Mike Easley



,

Dear Governor Easley,

I urge you to do everything in your power to see that our state enacts a version of "Jessica's Law." As you probably know, the Florida law was named in memory of 9-year old Jessica Lunsford, who was raped and killed by a repeat sex offender. The law establishes a minimum 25-year sentence for anyone convicted of molesting a young child. It also requires that paroled sex offenders wear a GPS positioning unit so police can keep track of them at all times. Research shows that criminals who prey on young children tend to repeat their crimes many times. Far too many young boys and girls have been brutalized by sex predators that should have been locked away. These abusers need to be kept off the streets and out of our neighborhoods. Enacting some form of "Jessica's Law" will protect our youngest and most vulnerable citizens, and will save lives. I hope you will get behind this legislation immediately. Thank you very much for your concern and your help.

Sincerely,

John Steadman

Hello Mrs. Perdue,


I am an adoptive and foster parent in Wilkes County.† I am writing because of my concern regarding foster†and adoptive children and families and the effects budget cuts are and may continue to have on them in the future.† I do not feel the state of NC should cut in these areas nor any area regarding the children of NC; this is the wrong area to make budget cuts in.† This will effect our future generation and childrens development.†



It is being rumored in†the Wilkes Foster†Parent Association that adoption assistance, state paid adoptions, and adoption funding will be stopped in the near future.† This will have a very huge negative impact on†NC†foster children and jepordize there forever homes and families.† Many foster and adoptive families I personally know have a house full of children because they have the†love and†conceren for these children.††They do not do it because of the money; but†the money enables†them to help more children.† If and when these funds are cut or stopped all together I really feel more children will end†up in group homes until they age out of care.† Please, please stand up†for these children and speak on their behalf.† Thank you.

> Subject: Caldwell St. Proposed project Brevard NC
> Dear Mr. Williams
> I am quite concerned over plans to consider making Caldwell Street a main thoroughfare through our small town. If you must alter the town's footprint so tragically, aren't there other congested areas that deserve your attention before Caldwell Street is so drastically altered? At present, it is a lovely winding way that holds onto the charm and allure that make Brevard so special. Highway 64/Broad Street is already being used as the main crossroad and it is unlikely that any alteration of Caldwell Street will change that. Instead, it will widen our town and create†conditions suitable to even†more congestion. How much change can Brevard stand before it becomes like every other "once charming" little town, sacrificing the characteristics that draw tourists, and instead forcing Brevard to become a town that folks simply pass through on their way somewhere else. What will that do to our local businesses and our lifestyle?
> Available dollars need to go towards education, affordable housing, and improved health care before they go towards creating more traffic and more exhaust emissions. I'd like to see us unified to create better lives for our citizens not more congested ones.

	I am writing in favor of renewing Session Law 2007-326/HB 956 which allows a "retired teacher" to be employed exempt from the earnings cap. †I am concerned that some positions †where there are teacher shortages may not be filled with qualified teachers. †If the law is not renewed, please have a hardship clause that would allow hiring "retired teachers" without an earnings cap for "hard-to-fill" positions such as Special Education teachers to prevent this from happening.†
Sincerely,

Following is the question just received:
Visitor: Mrs. Sue Moore

Address: 8427 Sherryn Run, Terrell, NC 28682

Email: hbsmoore@embarqmail.com

Subject: HR 3170

Comment: Dear Sir, Today the US House of Representatives may be voting on a bill to allow public funding for abortion. How can we even consider funding murder of innocent children? I am asking you to OPPOSE HR 3170. As you know, the Dorman Amendment has been upheld since 1988, except for a brief moment in time during the reign of President Clinton. Dozens of laws protecting our innocent babies would be up for appeal if this passes. Have we come so far in this country toward selfishness that we now feel that murder is OK? A tiny embryo at 6 weeks has fingers and toes, a brain and eyes developing. This is no mass of skin. This is a child of God!!! Please do not vote for HR 3170. The choice is yours. Not only will you answer to your community who voted for you, but to God. Murder is murder. This could have been your child, your parents, your siblings, or even you for that matter, murdered before you could even live in this great United States. Represent us well. Hear our views. Respond as God would have you do. Choose life. Respectfully, Sue Moore A NC Voter
