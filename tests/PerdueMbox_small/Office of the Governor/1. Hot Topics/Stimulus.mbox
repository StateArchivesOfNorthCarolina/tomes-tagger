Subject: The Stimulus Package

Comment: My question to relate to our President. I do know know much about who is selected to receive the money, it looks like business are receiving the money. Why not divide the money and it to those who are a registered voter, who will pay off their bills and you have done your job. Of course they will buy something for themselves, but all will get the bill collecters off their back. That is how I seee the money distrubuted to the American People. Thank you. Kim P.

Please if you get a chance could you please help sort these things out. Yes we as a state need it but there are things that are way out there. . Thanks for listening Allen Reed

Subject: Economic Recovery Bill

Comment: Do you know how much money from the economic recovery bill will be allocated to our state specifically for Health and Education resources? Unemployment is so high here, people are in long lines at the Forsyth County Social Services Bldg and at ESC offices, they really need quicker access to medicaid, food stamps and unemployment benifits. All of these processes can take months to get, while people are forced to move out of there homes because they have been layed off. I also want to know if your pushing our senators, Hagan (Dem) and especially Burr to vote for funding for Health care and Education here in NC, for which the Economic recovery bill supports in general ( Gov programs e.g. Medicaid, Food stamps, Planned Parenting etc.) Those things that all races are now united together bc of commonly loss of jobs and standing in long lines for unemployment, food stamps or medicaid. Please push Burr for our sake. Tax cutts to private business dont mandate, re-hiring those layed off, nor providing health insurance to those workers, nor that it just wont fatten there own paychecks to themselves, just like the Banks bailouts, they got fatter and richer, still not lending and still laying off folks. I voted for you, and I hope to get a resonable response. I have emailed Sen. Hagan with no response yet.

Subject: TAXES

Comment: The Obama-Biden plan will cut taxes overall, reducing revenues to below the levels that prevailed under Ronald Reagan (less than 18.2 percent of GDP). The plan is a net tax cut -- his tax relief for middle class families is larger than the revenue raised by his tax changes for families over $250,000. Coupled with his commitment to cut unnecessary spending, Obama will pay for this tax relief while bringing down the budget deficit. Whose making sure this is going to happen?????

RE: Stimulus Bill

President Obama and Congress are currently working on a stimulus bill in the hopes of jumpstarting our economy.The legislation currently being debated in Congress would spend almost a trillion dollars of borrowed money on projects and programs that are unlikely to produce any real broad-based stimulus or create jobs that will still be here two years from now. This spending will be on top of the $1.2 trillion budget shortfall that the federal government is already projected to have in this year alone. If the bill that is currently being proposed in the Senate does not change drastically, then I will not be able to support it and I hope you will NOT support it either.

Sincerely,

Richard Pyburn

Subject: economy

Comment: Governor Perdue I am very concerned about several items the President will address in the near future. The first being: 1) the stimulus pkg: Looks more like Welfare and pork projects. And even illegal aliens could benefit w/o even paying in taxes. Please take out the Pork! 2) Illegal immigration The President will open borders, grant amnesty, do away with E-Verify. Our state is overrun with Mexicans, and they will break the state w/medicaid, food stamps, etc. The only thing they are bringing us is cheap labor and drugs. And the only ones who benefit: businesses. In this job market, should they be given first choice? Where are the immigrants that strive for higher education and citizenship. Mexicans send their money back to Mexico. Do we really want to be like California? We need re-think the law of granting citizenship to those who are born here. 4)Energy costs If the US goes green, who pays? Gas prices during this past year should have forewarned everyone. That is partly to blame for this recession. If you are spending more money on fuel, how can anyone afford a house payment? I agree we need alternative fuel, but not at increased heating and a/c cost, food costs, etc. This past year has depeleted my savings. I cannot afford to give extra to energy companies. And on the state level, Mileage taxes? We are told to conserve, conserve, conserve. And when we do, the state revenue falls and we have a new tax? So the only decision is: Who will profit, oil company or goverment? 3) Taxes. Where are the tax breaks for the people who pay taxes? I made $40k last year and paid $10k in combined taxes. This is ridiculous. State taxes have increased, property taxes have increased 40% each re-evaluation in the past 8 years and I don't see state or county (Moore) trying to reduce government spending or positions. When money is tight, don't automatically raise taxes, tighten your belts like we regular people have to do. The state keeps trying to impose new taxes. Evidently they have created a position in Raleigh just for "someone to come up with new taxes." 4) Fair tax. We need this bill. How simple could this be? No tax cuts for the rich. Even Mexicans pay. This is a win situation. If you don't have the money to pay taxes, you don't buy. 5) I would also like to see the buffoons in Washington and the lending institutions be investigated for this housing situation. No one should have the power to drive a country into recession like these guys have. We need more regulation on speculators, bank fraud, government payoffs. Who is keeping the government honest? Do away with the lobbyists, except for none profits. 6) Gun control. Where does Obama stand on this? Please try to speak for the people of North Carolina on these important issues. The past few years have made all working people a little desperate and insecure. We are facing layoffs, short workweeks, increased costs without pay increases. (We cannot just vote for our raises). Thank you

Comment: Innovative means need to be found to allow the prisoners in our penal institutions to work and earn a portion if not all the money needed to maintain their lives in prison. At a minimum they can raise a large portion of their own food. There are many diffent items that could be made/manufactured by the prisoners and then sold to businesses to sell to the consumer. Suggested items/merchandise to be manufactured would be items that would otherwise be imported from outside the United States. Surely the prisoners could make these items/merchandise at a competitive price. A portion of the Federal stimulus package could be used to fabricate/build the necessary facility to produce/manufacture these products.

Subject: Economic Stimulus and Health Care for All

Comment: Governor I, like many Americans, have been becoming increasing frustrated by the partisan politics in Washington. However, I am even more frustrated by the lack of fresh and effective ideas. Republicans always want tax decreases, Democrats always want to increase social spending. Both act as if one idea is mutually exclusive of the others. Below is a letter that I have sent to President Obama and leaders in both of both parties in the house and senate. I believe it to be a fresh new idea that benefits Americans AND the businesses for which they work. This idea is neither pro business, nor pro union. It provides health care to nearly all Americans without getting bogged down in the moral debates of marriage verses civil unions. It provides flexibility to get health care for those who are willing to work full time but may not be able to find a full time job. It embodies the rewards to businesses that provide jobs to Americans as supported by President Obama during the campaign. It supports the competiveness of American businesses especially small businesses as supported by Republican nominee John McCain. I submit this idea to the American public and ask that they consider it as an idea that rises above partisan politics. This idea is particular effective because; since it is essentially a change in the accounting of the health care liability, it will be immediately available to companies as well as state and local governments. State and local governments should particularly support this idea as it will impact their budgets immediately and unilaterally as well. If those governments truly have "shovel ready" projects, they will be able to stimulate their local economy almost overnight. Mr. President, Honorable Senators and Representatives; Subject: Economic Stimulus and Health Care I am writing both out of frustration and hopefulness regarding the stale ideas that continually come out of both parties. These ideas demonstrate, what I call, two dimensional thinking when far superior ideas can be achieved with multi-dimensional thinking. I have a proposed economic stimulus idea that will benefit all of the most important areas of our economy and will benefit business and individuals alike. In addition, it will give American Businesses a competitive advantage without having the risk of overhauling complete industries. The basics of the idea are simple. First we immediately head toward Nationally funded capitalistic health care. By this I mean, that all businesses would be required to provide all full-time employees with health care plans. These plans can and should include reasonable and median employee cost participation, along with normal deductible and out of pocket limits. Additionally, these companies would receive tax credits/payments from the federal government equal to the cost of 75% of these costs. Furthermore, more Â½ of the savings that these companies realize must immediately be passed on to all employees who make less than $250,000 per year in the way of immediate wage increases. Since, this is primarily a publicly financed program, pre-existing conditions would always be allowed. Companies who fail to pass on these cost reductions to their employees would be subject fines that were a significant multiple of (say 10 times) the costs that they should have passed on to employees. Additionally, large companies such as Walmart, who employ large numbers of part-time employees must provide health-care as well if there employees are not eligible for care on a family policy of another employer. Medium and small companies who employ part time workers would contribute proportional costs to local insurance cooperatives and would be reimbursed by the federal government proportionally as well. Employees, such as single mothers who might work multiple part-time jobs that add up to full time hours, would be able to purchase full health insurance through these localized insurance cooperatives by paying only the equivalent of an employee's share at a major employer through payroll deduction. This would allow them to get the same quality of care at the same costs as full time workers employed by major corporations. This plan could be implemented relatively quickly because it does not require major industry overhauls of the insurance or health care industries. Not only this, all current capitalistic principles such as competition remain in place. Furthermore, the expiration of the Bush tax increases would be appropriate to help fund this program going forward. The timing of the expiration or these taxes could be postponed or moved forward as appropriate relative to the whatever timing that the economic recovery circumstances dictates. This plan has all of the following benefits: â€¢ Provides immediate competitive advantage to companies who American Workers thus encouraging investment here in the USA. â€¢ Provides Health care to all working Americans regardless of whether they are full-time of part time. â€¢ Encourages employment â€¢ Deductibles and out of pocket limits help prevent abuse. â€¢ Provides immediate business stimulus â€¢ Provides immediate cash to the public to encourage spending. â€¢ Does not require overhaul of insurance industries â€¢ Still provides incentives for companies to keep costs low, therefore minimize overall costs to the public. â€¢ Provides a mechanism to force insurance companies to continue care of pre-existing conditions. â€¢ State and Local Governments who are cash strapped as well would benefit similarly to businesses. Based on a number of approximately 300 million Americans and a individual cost of $5000 per worker this is a $1.5 trillion dollar total cost and a cost to the government of $1.13 trillion annually (based on the 75% participation). The 2010 individual tax code could be adjusted as necessary to make additional withholding to minimize deficit spending. Meanwhile, ALL American Businesses would get a competitive advantage and a one or two year stimulus while virtually all Americans would immediately get a raise. This idea respectfully submitted by, Gary W. Parker 5661 N. Sunset Ln Brazil, Indiana 47834 812-448-6315

Subject: stimulus

Comment: Please re-think BAILOUT- â€˜Artificial Stimulationâ€™ The stimulus package that is currently being considered is overlooking the most important part of stimulating the economy. It is the individual Americans, all 305,000,000 of us, who will eventually have to repay this debt and it is this general populace who will benefit little, if any, from the current proposals. Money is being given in large chunks to selective big business with little accountability and it will not ever benefit the individual in this country, just add to the burden of the â€˜public debtâ€™. A true economic stimulation would start â€˜at the bottomâ€™ and run through the economy in a natural way. All businesses: banks, mortgage lenders, auto manufacturers, food stores, airlines, colleges, gas stations, Mom and Pop stores, the stock market, etc., would benefit in direct proportion to their size and popularity of use. Virtually no market in the U.S. would be untouched. Every state would benefit, every school, every doctor. This would be done in a natural progression from the bottom up rather than the top down, (which will NOT work because of greed on every level). The current proposed stimulus will never benefit the common person, but the common person will pick up the tab. This would be a relatively simple process at this time of year. Each person who files income tax could be sent a check for $1000 per dependent. (Regardless of, and independent of, the status of their return.) The people who need it the most would benefit the most. For example: a single mother with six kids. Can you just imagine what this might mean to her? An address for people to return the check if they donâ€™t need it should be included; our government might be surprised by the number of people who would do this. It would never happen from â€˜big businessâ€™. Use returned money toward the national debt being created! A thousand dollars doesnâ€™t mean a thing to a large company but it could mean a great deal to an individual who just needs that one little break to set their finances right. It could prevent thousands of people from having to be foreclosed on, or keep them from losing their lease. It might make the difference between giving up their car and keeping their job. It would put food on the table and pay medical bills. This would be a TRUE economic recovery- and the money would eventually get disbursed to â€˜Corporate Americaâ€™ where it is going anyway- but not without first having benefited each and every person. Those who are in desperate straits and those who are not. I hope you can see the merits of this idea. It would actually cost less than the current proposal (there would be â€˜money left overâ€™ for other things). Also, it would seem to me that any Congressman, Senator, Governor (and President) who would support this fresh approach to our current problems would certainly gain favor in the eyes of those who they represent. All too often, they forget where their true strength lies. This fair-handed and even disbursement of stimulus monies would be widely supported. If you have received this suggestion and agree that this simple and direct approach would be a satisfying and effective alternative to current proposals, please forward it or otherwise pass it on to whoever you feel may be able to promote its inception- before itâ€™s too late and this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity passes us by. Thank You

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, Congratulations on your recent election! I am writing to request that you please bring to bear any legal influence that your office can muster to convince our Senators to vote NO on this massive stimulus bill. There are far too many parts of this spendfest that simply don't make sense as part of economic recovery. The government does not produce a product, and therefore does not earn money with which to embark on this plan- it takes from us, the citizens, instead of trusting us to keep more of our money and to stimulate the economy from within. When my wife and I face money problems, we cancel satellite tv additions, eat out less, and spend more wisely. I don't understand the notion that government shouldn't be equally responsible- especially with other people's money! Please whatever you can do...no to the stimulus plan as it stands.

Small aircraft, particulary helicopters, are vital business too, not luxuries. The majority of these aircraft are used by small and medium businesses to transport sales staff and expert technicians. Our members include emergency responders and chairtable organizations which provide critical medical transportation services. Damaging general aviation will practically eleminate these chairtable flights Sincerely, Tim Snyder

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am writing to you to ask you to urge our congressional representatives and our Senators to vote against the "Stimulus Package" currently being debated in the Senate. I beleive there is FAR too much 'pork' to make it a viable solution to the current economic crisis. I have several children and I do not want to pass on a record sized national debt to them.

Subject: Economic Stimulus & Republicans

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am writing today in regard to the current economic stimulus plan that is working its way through the US Congress. My question for you is... Are you speaking with Senator Burr in regard to this legislation and what it means to the State of NC? If so, I hope that Senator Burr is hearing the message that this stimulus plan is essential to the constituents of NC! Also, his petty politics & desire for more tax cuts for wealthy Republicans is not what this state needs, nor what the country needs. This is a crucial time for all of us, and we need representatives that understand that and who put their constituents ahead of their politics. I hope that you and your staff are sending that message loud and clear to Senator Burr. Perhaps with more immediate action on this stimulus bill, the State of NC won't have to make the drastic cuts that seem inevitable without it (as mentioned in the Charlotte Observer's Sunday paper). Thanks for your attention to this matter, and I wish you the best of luck in your term as our Governor! Sincerely, Chris Porier Charlotte, NC

Subject: Spending Bill

Comment: I oppose the American Recovery and Reinvestment Bill of 2009. We should not enact an expensive spending bill under the pretense of stimulus or recovery. We cannot spend our way to prosperity, and such an expansion of the federal government will put a crushing burden on taxpayers in the long-term. If there is an infrastructure bill, it should repair deficient roads and bridges only, not directly or indirectly fund special interest pork-projects. Central planning and bigger government cannot solve our problems. Authorizing the proposed $825 billion will only be throwing good money after bad. Instead of trying to pick winners and losers from Washington, Congress should cut spending, strip down onerous regulations and allow individuals and free enterprise to flourish. One-time spending on hand-picked projects will not lead to sustained economic growth.

Subject: Support for President Obama's Stimulus package

Comment: Stimulus package Comments / suggestions: (1). Unemployment insurance benefits should not be taxed (as earned or unearned income) by the (IRS) Federal or States...(at least for the years 2008 - 2010). This would help millions of people that have lost their jobs. The former employees, on unemployment, have already taken a 70% + decrease in take home funds. (2). The AMT tax should not kick in (or increase the patch from $46,000 up to $75,000) until ones taxable income is above $75,000; to include 2008 tax returns. (This would be an excellent way to give a tax break to the middle income tax payers). (3). Automatically, across the board, reset ALL mortgages @ 4%, to include those people that have been paying their mortgage; they are struggling but still trying to pay. My suggestion is: For all lenders / banks that received bailout funds, they should be instructed to automatically reset all mortgages they hold to 4%; without the people having to refinance and without any added cost. Automatically, across the board, resetting ALL mortgages, especially those with a balance under $250,000, down to 4% would help allot of people keep their homes and stop allot of foreclosures. Foreclosures cost the banks allot and it would help the banks and the people. People need help now and I believe these three suggestions would be an immediate and tremendous help to millions of our people.

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I know that you are not of my party. I am a Republican. However, I know that you are a North Carolinian. We all need to stick together to help our great nation. I am writing to you to request that you speak out against the Stimulus Package that is now facing the Senate. I have written to Senator Burr to request that he vote against this package. I would like to know that you understand that this package is filled with more pork than any other package. We need to over-come this crisis as Americans, not begging for money from the government. As Americans, we can over-come anything that is placed before us. Citizens can cut their spending and start using their money wisely. We have, for far to long now, enjoyed the ablility to buy what we want, when we want and put alot of things on credit. People were given loans that they could not afford. I blame the people that took those loans, not the lenders. If you know that you only make $30,000.00 a year, you know that you cannot afford a $150,000.00 home. If you make less than $30,000.00 a year, you do not need to drive a Lexus or BMW. People need to tighten their belts and watch their pennies. I understand that many companies have laid-off workers and/or closed their doors. Well, if we have more items being made in America, then there can be more jobs created in America. I have worked in a law firm for 15 years. I have not had a raise in 6 years. I make less than $30,000 a year. I have a modest home and I drive a older car. I know my limits. More people should be aware of their limits. Governor Perdue, I implore you to please speak-out against the Stimulus Package. Please do so for our wonderful state and for our wonderful country. May God Bless you and your family and may God Bless our State and our Country.

“Too often bills are rushed through Congress and to the president before the public has the opportunity to review them,” the Obama-Biden campaign website states. “As president, Obama will not sign any non-emergency bill without giving the American public an opportunity to review and comment on the White House website for five days.”   ** extend this to EMEGENCY bill as well - ok ?

Dear Senators - and all legislators!

Please request that there be an ammendment to allow the public to review the stimulus package befor signing:
as a good faith measure!  It helps to spread the risk of possible failure and delay in the process of recovery .

Before this lay off, my bills were current and as soon as I am gainfully employed again, my bills will be current once again.

Dear Governor Perdue,



First, congratulations on winning the election.



I am writing to ask you to vigorously OPPOSE the stimulus bill being considered in the United States Senate. I know you can have a voice with both of our Senators, and ask that your voice be in support of free market solutions rather than the heavily pro-government proposals now being considered. It is my belief that most, if not all of the provisions of that bill are the opposite of what we really need to stimulate the economy. I would favor your supporting tax cuts, especially for small businesses. That is where I believe the most benefit will come from in encouraging the economy to grow again. I would be happy to explain my views in more depth, but am sure you are quite busy and also familiar with the issues pro and con.



Thank you for considering my position, and representing we North Carolinians.

 Mrs. Purdue, Mrs.. Wiley and Mr. Bingham,

 In regards to the Stimulus package....

I have been living in the United States for most of my life. (except for a few years for Motorola in Kuwait to put back communications in the oil fields.)

I do not understand why the stimulus package has become such large add on of pork to so many local state and national government agendas?

It seems like everyone has their hand out but not too many people are really looking at what stimulates a depressed economy?

Jobs stimulate economies but I am afraid it is not just the Job but the costs of getting qualified workers to do the jobs we need to be competitive in a world economy.

We also have to have pride in what we make and we cannot be outsourcing our talent or going over to every country where we can get it done for cheaper.

I do not think this is just a US problem but a Global problem.

Maybe we have to get back to basics here in the US (not a fast and easy process) and come together at a grass roots local level to grow small business.

There has to be a way to stimulate Jobs at the local level.

I am afraid throwing money at the problem may not be the answer unless it is directly utilized to getting really qualified people into these jobs that can get us up and going in a rapid manner so we are very competitive in the world markets.

America used to be the bread basket of the world and to some degree I believe we still are. We used to be really great at making quality products... what happened to that?

I still believe we can make really great products but we have to get back to that quality without being too greedy. We have to use the tools and resources at our disposal. We have to learn from history.

What stimulates the economy?  Jobs do.   Where can we get some of this needed talent? From some of the older people in our country that know the craft trades, farming, machinery manufacture, service industries, food industry, technology trades .... getting back to basics. Get some of these captains of industries if they really care about this country they will help stimulate jobs by creating them not so much  for making a profit but for making America great again.
These Captains of industries can make a difference People like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Lee Iacocca etc.., We can learn from the Japanese and the Germans about making quality products here in the USA. we can do this by having all of the suppliers of the Manufacturing Facility very close by so that shipping costs are kept to a minimum. This has to be well planned out in where we locate our Manufacturing facilities so we can keep costs of the materials needed to manufacture to a minimum.

I really hope that they take a really hard look at this bill for stimulating this economy.
They need to stimulate by creating Jobs and Jobs that help a large part of the American public the middle class the workers who want and need to get back to work.

Two more questions? 

Don't we have really smart people in think tanks that can give our politicians solid ideas on how to come up with a good Stimulus package?

And cant we learn from past history not to repeat our mistakes of past history again cant we reach out to other countries who have gone through this and get some good ideas from them?

Comment: Mrs. Perdue, When you present to the Senate to day, probably with the intention to sway them to pass the stimulus bill, be sure to mention how President Obama will appoint 12 people to oversee the bill and will pay from the bill astronomical amounts to that group and that is part of the plan you support. Please also be sure to mention how Pres. Obama's plan will increase government positions, while you work hard here in NC to decrease government. Please also be sure to mention to them that this bill is filled with earmarks to so many people when it is finally read. And most of all PLEASE!!! Read the actual Bill, not the summary that was written by the same people who wrote the bill. Read it and analyze it before you support something that is not good for our country and you are grouped with those who hurt our country because of your stance. And most of all - pray! Pray that your decision will be one that is not popular but sound and with deep conviction.

Pelosi put together this outrageous so called stimulus bill full of the liberal wish list and as people are finding out about it, they are getting angrier and angrier.  The Democrats are always talking about “fairness” but they don’t mind filling up their own pork bellies first.

Much of this is a San Francisco revitalization program.  She’s put him in a very uncomfortable place. 



We don’t need our local and state government looking at this as a feeding tube either.



While they are putting this garbage together, Iran is shooting off missiles, Russia is working on reuniting the Soviet Union and Great Britain has choked itself to death on SOCIALIST policies.



We need leadership not beggars in chief. We need JOBS, not government boondoggles.

Subject: Pork Payback stimulus package

Comment: This is a travesty that you would want this bill to be pushed through. This bill is filled with nothing but paybacks to the groups that supported the president. It is also shamefull that the presidents is going around and saying how much a catastrophe it would be if this bill isnt passed. Talk about fear mongering and scare tactics! Why should north carolina taxpayers allow 1 cent to be in this bill when they cant even account for the billions they gave the banks? If you offer me a rebate, I am not going to buy a 20 thousand dollar car just to get a $2,000 dollar rebate when the president is telling me the world is ending! You are just encouraging people to go out and incure more debt which is what got us into this situation in the first place!I want the goverment to receind all my federal and state tax for last year. Yes, these taxes that you bozo keep heeping on us takes up and 1/4 of my paycheck each year. If i can pay down my debt then i would have money to go out and purchase items I need which of course would stimulate the economy. BTW- the banks are doing what they should of been doing in the first place and that is not loaning money to people who's debt ratio is too high.( thanks to Barney Frank and the Democrats that forced the banks to loan money to everybody under the sun money when they couldnt afford it!) this bill wont get jobs back and wont create jobs. you need to tax companies more that send jobs overseas and then reduce all these taxes you keep heeping on the middle class. At least Senator Dole had the backbone to stand up to her party and vote the right way twice against the 700 billon dollar package!

Subject: Federal Stimulus Bill

Comment: Thank you for not adding your signature to the 19 Governors that signed a letter supporting this bad bill. It is great transfer of wealth from prudent states to wasteful states. We do not need to shift our tax dolars to CA & FL. They over spent. They must pay. The bill does nto create jobs in the private sector in the NC, but it does give a lot of money to formerly rich state that were fiscally irresponsible. Please encourage our federal legistrators to not support the bill in its current form. It needs to be significantly pared back and shifted from creating government jobs to creating private sector jobs while leaving enough borrowing room to revitalize the private securities market. If too much borrowing occurs it will significantly weaknen the Dollar & hurt us average worker in the USA and particularly NC. Thank you.

Comment: I do not wish for the Stimulus Package to be passed. Please vote against the Stimulus Package. This current Stimulus Package will only weaken our economy it will not help to boast any stimulus in our economy. It will hurt our nation as a whole and I can not vote for this package. My generation and future generations will be paying this off forever and it will not be worth it.

Comment: Please do not support this bill and spend money we don't have and make us and our children pay for these items that so obviously will NOT create jobs. Please work with all parties involved and take the time to look at all suggestions, trim, and not rush into something so tremendous that we may never be able to recover from. The American people understand what is going on, but are not given enough credit. The resilence the country has never failed us. Trust the voters that put you in office and listen when we say we don't want the items passed that are in that bill and we want other alternatives. Thank you.

Comment: Dear Governor, First I want to offer my congratulations on your new job.I am a registered Republican however, I voted for you because I feel like you were the most qualified to lead the citizens of your state. The main reason for this communication is asking for your action on a stimulus package designed to have an immediate positive impact on our housing industry. The Federal folks are working hard on several initiatives however, we need to know what your plan is. The housing industry is the engine which drives our economies and if you want to people back to work, now, housing is the tool to do it. In addition to the Federal initiatives, Banks and Lending institutions need to loosen their grips on builders for construction loan financing. It's horrible! Your first 100 days are very important. Good luck. Respectfully, Ronnie Watt Broker/Developer

Comment: I have heard that you are agitating that the current stimulus bill that is before the Senate be passed swiftly. The current stimulus bill will not help our economy and instead will burden our children and grandchildren. We cannot correct a problem of greed and overspending with more greed and overspending. The last election was supposedly about change. Instead we have politics as usual with a huge balooning payback to the abortion industry, school and labor unions and billions of dollars of pork. It is reprehensible. If this bill passes, the American people will remember who is responsible and who the supporters of this bill were. Assured long-term tax reductions for income producers and small business, incentives for home-buyers--there are things we can do that will actually help the economy. The current stimulus bill will most certainly not!

Subject: Stimulus bailout

Comment: Dear Governor, My husband and I run a small family owed construction business, we build homes. My question concerns the bailout.... Why does the stimulus bailout seem to be geared mostly to help state or govermental type project. Why is there no help for the small private sector. Small business helps fuel the ecom. How will this bailout help us? The banks are making it hard and harder to continue in busines. Not sure how long we can last. My bank took the 1st bailout and its now harder to do busines with than before. We are now building a house where the construction loan is with this particle bank and they will not give us a draw until the basement is finished. So now we've become builder and bank. I've read about the homebuyer tax credit and that will help the home buyer. We need someone working to help us! Thank you. Sincerly, Wanda Testerman Willow Bay Construction Company

Subject: Stimulus Package

Comment: I do not need a response. I just want to share my views. As a republican who voted for Mrs. Purdue I had high hopes for her, and was impressed with her immediate action on the state of education in North Carolina. I was dismayed, however, that she would support such a financially irresponsible scheme such as the current stimulus package being touted by the current democratic-ruled congress. Any bill that has ANY items that are not directly linked to the subject at hand should not be passed. It's the pork of these bills that destroy our financial solvency. As a grandmother I am surprised the Governor Purdue would support this particular bill. It is only creating more and more debt for future generations... debt her grandchildren, great-grandchildren and possibly great-great-grandchildren will inherit. Does she seriously want to leave this kind of legacy behind? I hope that Governor Purdue will look at the long-range consequences for any action she supports. Any quick-fix will only be a band aid and will not solve the current problems. Any quick-fix program that will require additional funding to FIX the fix is just not being responsible with our tax dollars. Thank you for your consideration.

Subject: Federal Stimulus Bill

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue, As a taxpayer in North Carolina, I am appalled that anyone in this country, especially those who are elected to represent â€œwe the peopleâ€, would consider any portion of this Stimulus Package being considered in the Senate now. Having reviewed this bill myself, it is unconscionable to believe that our government would initiate a bill that puts this entire nation at risk. This Stimulus bill contains such outrageous expenditures that it simply defies all logic. And I am equally appalled that President Obama would have the audacity to state "If we do not move swiftly to sign [the act] into law, an economy that is already in crisis will be faced with catastrophe." while going on to say, "This is not my assessment. This is not Nancy Pelosi's assessment. This is the assessment of the best economists in the country. This is the assessment of some of the former advisers of some of the same folks who are making these criticisms right now." This Stimulus Bill is by far the most daring, irresponsible, unethical and wasteful attempt Iâ€™ve ever witnessed by the United States Government that it should be considered â€œGrand Theftâ€ of the U.S. Taxpayer. How can you as Governor of this state, believe that passage of this legislation will create jobs here in North Carolina? Based on the following expenditures contained in this bill, please tell me how you, or anyone in the Senate or House could recommend voting for this bill with any form of clear conscience while expecting â€œwe the peopleâ€ to believe YOU are working for OUR best interest. $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts $380 million in the Senate bill for the Women, Infants and Children program $300 million for grants to combat violence against women $2 billion for federal child-care block grants $6 billion for university building projects $15 billion for boosting Pell Grant college scholarships $4 billion for job-training programs, including $1.2 billion for â€œyouthsâ€ up to the age of 24 $1 billion for community-development block grants $4.2 billion for â€œneighborhood stabilization activitiesâ€ $650 million for digital-TV coupons; $90 million to educate â€œvulnerable populationsâ€ $15 billion for business-loss carry-backs $145 billion for â€œMaking Work Payâ€ tax credits $83 billion for the earned income credit $150 million for the Smithsonian $34 million to renovate the Department of Commerce headquarters $500 million for improvement projects for National Institutes of Health facilities $44 million for repairs to Department of Agriculture headquarters $350 million for Agriculture Department computers $88 million to help move the Public Health Service into a new building $448 million for constructing a new Homeland Security Department headquarters $600 million to convert the federal auto fleet to hybrids $450 million for NASA (carve-out for â€œclimate-research missionsâ€) $600 million for NOAA (carve-out for â€œclimate modelingâ€) $1 billion for the Census Bureau $89 billion for Medicaid $30 billion for COBRA insurance extension $36 billion for expanded unemployment benefits $20 billion for food stamps $4.5 billion for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers $850 million for Amtrak $87 million for a polar icebreaking ship $1.7 billion for the National Park System $55 million for Historic Preservation Fund $7.6 billion for â€œrural community advancement programsâ€ $150 million for agricultural-commodity purchases $150 million for â€œproducers of livestock, honeybees, and farm-raised fishâ€ $2 billion for renewable-energy research ($400 million for global-warming research) $2 billion for a â€œclean coalâ€ power plant in Illinois $6.2 billion for the Weatherization Assistance Program $3.5 billion for energy-efficiency and conservation block grants $3.4 billion for the State Energy Program $200 million for state and local electric-transport projects $300 million for energy-efficient-appliance rebate programs $400 million for hybrid cars for state and local governments $1 billion for the manufacturing of advanced batteries $1.5 billion for green-technology loan guarantees $8 billion for innovative-technology loan-guarantee program $2.4 billion for carbon-capture demonstration projects $4.5 billion for electricity grid $79 billion for State Fiscal Stabilization Fund I have written to our Senators about this and Iâ€™m watching to see how they vote. â€œWe the Peopleâ€ have had enough of this wasteful spending of our hard earned tax dollars and anyone that votes for this bill should be sent to jail. It is truly Grand Theft! Judge Yourself Accordingly, Daniel J. Wagner

Hello,  I heard on the news earlier this evening that you had spoken to a group indicating that you support the stimulus package.  The news has stated that the stimulus package includes wasteful spending and I personally don't understand how spending in these economic hard times, will stimulate the economy by inflating our tax burdens more.   I must state that I am personally a bit disappointed that you have stated you are in favor of voting yes for this stimulus package. 

Thank you - a very concerned NC resident and voter.

Comment: Governor Perdue, I am angry that you have urged the Federal Government to rush passage of a stimulus bill laden with waste. While I agree that this bill has some benefit for the State of NC, I also furiously disagree with mortgaging my Childrens future (and their own Childrens future when they have them). The amount of wasteful spending in this bill makes up a good 40% and has to be reduced. We can't afford the negative impact this will have for generations. The solution is to cut corporate taxes (I don't own a company that would benefit) to help them generate jobs. Please work with our Government officials toward reasonable goals and not wasteful spending. I want to live in a Democratic nation, not a Socialist regime. Sincerely, Mike Orlowski Clayton, NC

Comment: Gov. Perdue, I am writing to let you know that this quote attributed to you is an embarrassment to me. I pay my bills, I don't buy things I cannot afford and I do not expect others to bail me out if I overspend. Market forces are the American way out of this mess. Not more government programs. I do not support the Stimulus package. I am disappointed that you, my governer would. Her message was heard loud and clear: â€œpass the stimulus package without delay, with as few restrictions as possible, and do not delay distribution of the funds. We must put that money, and our people, to work now.â€ Thank you for your attention to this matter. Carla
