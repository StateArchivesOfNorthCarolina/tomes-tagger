Subject: Tax Refund

Comment: Below is the comment from Kenneth Lay relating to NC Tax Refunds. The State of NC needs to take a look at spending again. Unnecessary travel is going on, hiring is going on etc. all at the expense and welfare of the current State employee. The Department of Revenue accepted my tax electronically on February 2nd. I received my Federal back in a week. I DO NOT understand how the State of NC takes out each month of my pay the taxes and never has enough money to refund in a timely manner. I pay extra to have my taxes prepaired to get a rapid refund only to waste extra dollars that I do not have because the State NC can not manage their money better. My paycheck does not begin to cover the increase cost of living in the past couple of years. And it does not look like the State of NC cares one way or the other. As a state employee I am forced to budget my money with in the realm of my measley pay check. I do without medicine, gas, and groceries at times due to unconcern of government officials taking care of their employees. Shame on the State of North Carolina.... I want my refund with interest. The State not managing their money is no concern of mine, however my overage of taxes paid to the State is a major concern of mine. You can bet that if I owed, the State would take everything I owned to get their money. "Department of Revenue Secretary Kenneth Lay said refunds aren't running behind yet but likely could in the next few weeks. It's simply a matter of math, he said â€“ the state can't send out more money in refund checks than it's bringing in through tax collections."

Subject: NC Tax Refund

Comment: Governor Perdue, I was surprised and very unhappy about the news last night that there would be delays again this year in NC tax refunds. I certainly understood that the state was surprised by the economic downturn last year but not getting our tax refund on time this year is inexcusable. This is not the state's money and I will ensure that next year, we will owe NC and the state can wait for payment. If this is the way your administration is running the state's fiscal plan, maybe we need to rethink our support. This needs to be corrected. Craig Heckert

Subject: State Taxes

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am writing to you concerning my fiance. He found himself in a situation a couple of years ago and fell behind in paying his State taxes. We contacted Mr. Kanich at NCDOR and told him what had happened and he sent me a letter and we filled out all the necessary papers to enter into an installment agreement. We never heard from him. I later discovered that they filed a lien against him so we hired a tax consultant to contact them and we paid the 2007 tax but they have refused to release the lien. I then wrote Mr. Kanich another letter and explained that we had contacted him right away when we knew Mark would owe taxes and told him the entire story and explained that we were up front about the whole thing and we knew Mark would owe again for 2008. I told him that his office insisted that Mark sign a contract to pay $1500.00 a month and was even told he could be arrested if he didn't agree to this. The point here is Mark had some circumstances that led to this issue and he addressed them directly. He never tried to avoid anything. Yes he makes great money but he also has many financial obligations. He had only asked to give him a fair repayment plan as he has to pay $3,000 a month in alimony and that it would end in December of 2010. At that time he could increase the payment amount and get that paid too. What is troubling is that Mark is the person who has worked hard to get where he is and the guy who will pay more taxes than most. He had a couple of years that set him back. He has raised 5 children and supported each one without fail. He had to pay $200,000 to an ex whom he had no children with and who he had been separatd from for 14 months and only married for 7 years. in December his 9 month old grandson had a 10 cm. brain tumor removed and he had to help his daughter who is a single Mom during this time. My point here is this. He came forward and never tried to avoid the tax issue. NCDOR got all necessary information that they asked for and then decided to file a lien and tried to garnish wages. He could have been fired and nobody benefits from that. Mr. Kanich never once answered the letters that we sent certified. It just seems unfair that the taxpayer who contributes to his salary is treated with such disregard. I hope you will address this matter. It is frightening to have to agree to something that you know you may not be able to do every month. I hope you will address this matter.

Comment: It has come to my attention that North Carolina will again be delinquent on income tax returns. I find this to be above ridiculous. When you politicians talk about balancing the budget I never hear a word about cutting entitlement programs. People using the system overburden the taxpayer. These people have in many cases never worked and never intend to. Why should they? They can have babies and collect welfare and get more for having more babies! Itâ€™s high time that you elected officials recognize the welfare problem and address itâ€™s many abuses! Itâ€™s hard for me to comprehend that the taxpayer canâ€™t get their income tax return on time, with all of this welfare abuse. Stand up, have some backbone and do something about it!

Subject: Delay in NC State Income Tax Refunds

Comment: As an unemployed citizen of NC, times are tough. Both my wife and I have had to tighten our belts. Job prospects are not great for someone of my age. I finished doing my taxes yesterday only to discover that I owe the federal government approximately $1,800 for 2009. My state return indicated a refund of approximately $1,300. Needless to say, on our reduced income paying our federal taxes will be a challenge. Last week I heard the announcement that the State Treasurer will be delaying state tax refunds indefinitely due the state's cash flow challenges. While I understand the need for fiscal responsibility in handling state resources, the uncertainty of when I might get my state tax refund puts us in a special bind. I respectfully submit that as a matter of state policy, the Treasurer should make every effort to give priority to sending unemployed citizens their tax refunds as soon as possible. It should be fairly easy to cross reference state tax files with the rolls of the unemployed to see who's in greatest need. Thanks for your time and attention. Ed Rehkopf

Comment: I would suggest that you pay CLOSE attention to what Chris CHristie is doing in New Jersey. Raising taxes brings in LESS revenue,NOT MORE.We've been hit with more state taxes, county taxes,and soon the Bush tax cuts will expire. You're taxing too much and spending money we don't have. We can't afford to save for OUR retirement because we have to pay for YOURS. Money isn't being spent on childrens education, it's going to TEACHER'S retirement funds. State workers should have to save for retirement just like the rest of us, they make more money than most of us, we shouldn't be forced to pay for them.Cut GOVERNMENT SPENDING before we wind up like California. Civitas Institute has common sense solutions for NC, read the POLLS, this state is headed in the WRONG direction.

Comment: I understand that there may be times when you need to hold onto tax refunds. I do not think that keeping the refunds of out of work people are right. These are people that are barely keeping their heads above water and may need this to keep a roof over their heads for a few more months or keep from loosing their vehicle or even keep clothes on the kids backs. I know a lot of unemployed people and they were looking forward to their tax refunds. I have been out of work for over a year because I was hurt and have had no income but thank the Lord my husband has.So I'm not worried about me.But please stop and think of the others.If you need to keep the refunds of those who still are working I could understand but not on the backs of the unemployed. Thank you for your quick attention.

Governor Perdue,



Last year the economic turmoil was unprecedented and we citizens we disappointed to get our tax refunds late but we were glad to get them.  Now we are mad that you have not solved the budget problem last year and you have to get our refunds out late again this year.  It is time to take radical steps with the state budget and to FIRE STATE EMPLOYEES AND SHUT DOWN PROGRAMS to get the budget into a balanced situation.  If this happens again next year you and your party should expect to be voted out of office.



Thank you,

Dear Governor Perdue,

     I realize that it is hard times for NC, but I am one of the hurting under employed. Will you please send me my tax refund? I have a plan to do something extravagant with this money. Can I share my plan?
     I am going to pay my county taxes with it. Crazy, right? Now I am late or will be after the 8th of March. I will be humiliated by having my name published in the paper, I will be charged a fee for being late as well as additional interest. Will you be sending me interest on this money? Will I receive the late fee and additional interest from the state of NC?
     I can pay it.... on my credit card. Will I be paid additional interest monies too cover that charge from my bank? How would I be treated if I told NC that I was not going to pay taxes? Would you stand for my, "when things get better for me excuse?"  We both know the answer to that, don't we..
     Anyway, hope to here from you soon! My bank account hopes to see my tax dollars soon! Meanwhile, I will decide if I charge my taxes or be humiliated publicly...
     Thank you for allowing me to send this e-mail to your staff who will read and delete it. At least I feel like someone will get a laugh out of my situation, I know you will never read it or care to respond. Have a good day!

                                                                      Loving the hope and change!

Comment: I learned through the news media that NC's fiscal administrator is purposely delaying tax refunds to help with the state's cash crisis. I think that is simply wrong! I strongly suggest that you issue an Executive Order directing that all NC tax refunds be processed and paid according to the same schedule as the current IRS tax refund schedule. Further, I believe you should direct the state's fiscal managers to pay penalties and interest to those who's refunds are delayed (for the state's cash convenience) at the same rate as the state would charge my business if my Sales Tax or Withholding Tax returns were not filed or paid in a timely fashion. That would be the FAIR and EQUITABLE thing to do.

Comment: NC Department of Revenue needs to be straight up with citizens regarding our tax refunds. That money has set in State coffers all year gathering (I'm sure) a high amount of interest that the State keeps. Now it is up in the air if it will be 5 weeks or 5 years before we get our refunds back. NC may have a cash flow problem but we do too. If I owned them money it would be a different story! Someone needs to step up and address this issue on behalf the taxpayers.

Dear Mrs Perdue
              My husband work all year long for us to get our return s so that we can get caught up on our bills. I have been out of work over a year due to a car accident so my income was lost was 30,000.00. We are depending on out state tax to get our house payment caught up. I don't understand how taxes can be with held from you check, and when the public owes state tax we are expected to pay it , if we have it or not. And not only I but the rest of the citizens in NC I am sure feel the same. We filed electronically so we could get it back and start out fresh but NO when we go online or call it say it is being processed and everyone that is due a refund will get one. Well big deal we would like to know when. I have been a democratic all my life  but I don't think I will never ever vote again.

                                                                                                           Thank You

Comment: Your tax return has been received and your refund will be processed as quickly as possible. However, we cannot provide specific estimates on when individuals will receive their refunds. Everyone who is due a refund will receive a refund. We update refund information by 6 p.m. daily. Your refund information will remain the same throughout the day. Please wait at least 24 hours before inquiring again. this is all we see and hear no timeline this is unfair , not right and more they had the money to build two dams in nc this past year they took out more then what they should of out of our checks and now owe us and we are told no time line they wouldnt accept that if we owed them someone needs to be held accountable for whats going on someone needs to let us taxpayers know DATE when we can recieve our tax refund and if after april 15th us TAXPAYERS that are owed shoud be allowed to charge interest on what we are owed like they would us if we owed them ,,,,, not my fault they are having money problems heck we all are having money problems my light company and phone wont accept a no time line, stand up and give us our money .............i have spoke to the state senators office who told me they would check on it i have emailed them and no response i know of at least 50 workers or more that built two dams in nc that paid in alot of money to nc and they are probably owed as we are which we over paid way over paid by our refund that we are suppose to get back so you had my money you used it now give me back what i am owed......

Comment: For many years I have complained about the annual Communism Tax in NC. This is a tax disguised as a vehicle tax. It does no good to contact the legislature. They tell me it is a county tax. The county tells me it is a state tax. Same old BS year after year. I do not need some moron sending me an email telling me the history of this tax. It simply is wrong to continue to tax a vehicle year after year. I urge all of you to watch the news concerning the rioting in Greece. Stay tuned, it will be happening here soon. People, including myself, are mad as hell and will eventually strike back at a government that continues to screw us.
