Subject: Limits to Gov's power are good

Comment: I'm very nhappy to see that there are limits to the Govenors power. The courts ruling that Gov Perdue can not "replace" the duly elected DPI Superintendent is a victory for all citizen's of NC. Since moving back to NC in 2007, I've been very dissappointed with regard to many issues, including the HIGH TAX RATE, govenors flipping their nose at the rule of law and the general lack of respect for the citizens of NC. Gov Perdue needs to lower taxes and respect the tax payers more. Respectfully, Frank Kelly P.S. Last year when I called this office to complain about the then first lady's job at NCSU, I said it didn't pass the smell test. I was told it was all above board. It would appear that my initial thoughts were correct. Democrats better get their act together and get off the backs of NC tax payers.

Comment: Your actions against Atkinson is a waste of the taxpayers money. You eliminate jobs while wasting our money with lawyers, I will not vote for you ever again. Thats just like replacing you with a North Carolina CEO, the people elected you and we elected her, you were not elected to be replaced by someone else.

Yea you got your butt fried today didn't you bev. You idiot. Enjoy your term because I can pretty much guarantee it will be your last. Actually, I think what you have done for education so far could possibly land you in jail, where you and your cronies belong. Maybe you can share a cell w/ your messiah obama. I'm sure after his first and only term the skeletons will be exposed and land him in the same place. Actually, Hell would be a perfect place for you, obama, and pelosi. Now, quit sending me your worthless liberal crap, it only makes me sick, as do you.

Comment: Please do not appeal the finding of the judge in the June Atkinson case. You can be a great governor but this is making you look like a vindictive child that didn't get her way. Give up with grace, let Dr Atkinson do what the people elected her to do and you do what the people elected you to do. You were not elected to pay someone huge sums of money, as Bill Harrison is receiving, to try to circumvent an elected official. Please stop wasting the taxpayer's money on his salary and the useless appeal.

Subject: Atkinson vs. Harrison

Comment: Governor Perdue, will your office provide me with the job descriptions of both Dr. Atkinson and Dr. Harrison? I want to compare their duties and responsibilities relative to the wide disparity in their salaries. Of course, probably like most of your constituents, I'm curious what added responsibilities Dr. Harrison is being paid for that exceed Dr. Atkinson's - and that you believe she can't assume. Absent such information, I urge you to eliminate Dr. Harrison's position. Because of the state's budget funding problem, duplicate positions are unaffordable.

Comment: The people have voted and the judge has ruled. I have asked my senate and house representatives to ensure that the $265,000 school's CEO is fired and June Atkinson is allowed to do the job she was elected to do. While you are at it, cut the schools budget to get this fat out of it! We don‚Äôt need any more overhead (or taxes) in Raleigh and you don't need to give any more cronies high paying jobs! Where was your outrage when Mrs. Easley was getting a $850,000 multi year job at NCSU? And to think that Sen. Tony Rand thinks we need a constitutional amendment for the Governor to pack her cronies in positions of power is ridiculous! This and all other Democrats will be defeated it you try to put this on the ballot. You need to read the comments section on the News and Observer regarding this issue - I have never seen so many posted about anything you have done.

Subject: Department of Public Instruction

Comment: Governor Perdue: I have been following the DPI issue over the last few weeks in the N&O.  I believe that we have a state wide elected official in Dr. Atkinson to be the administor of that key function of educating the children of North Carolina. Better yet, the Supreme Court has ruled that Dr. Atkinson is the rightful administrator. Now is the time for you and your leadership tram to stop spending our money through the courts and redundant functions on this issue. It has been decided! It seems now we can save a lot of money - as you have been stressing - by closing down the offices run by Dr. Harrison and his staff and let the elected Dr. Atkinson do her job. Just think, I bet by eliminating Dr. Harrison, his staff and office expensives you could SAVE the state possibly as much as $1 million per year. Better yet, you could keep many productive classroom teachers "in their place" teaching students! What a difference it would make. We do need more classroom teachers and less non-productive administor in the education system. There seem to be too many layers of management now. Anyway, these are my thoughts and suggestions. They proibably won't be heard, but here they are. Oh, I almost forgot: NO MORE TAXES! We are paying too many diverse taxes now. An angry tax paying NC citizen James H. Harrell

You ask us to support education but you waste our money by appointing a separate CEO for education robbing our schools of money to provide teachers in the class room. Why don't you understand that wasting our dollars is why we don't support increaseing taxes when you are adding expenses of a high paying job that the court system says you shouldn't have done! How many other jobs have we got that we don't need all through the system, do your homework and cut these jobs and others that aren't needed and reduce our taxes instead of increasing them!!!!!

> Gov. Perdue Signs Bill to Increase Transparency in State Mental Health Facilities

Gov. Bev Perdue today signed Senate Bill 799 to increase the transparency of state mental health, developmental disability and substance abuse facilities by making more information in death records public. Perdue proposed this legislation in March with Attorney General Roy Cooper. It was sponsored by Sen. Rand (D-Bladen, Cumberland).†

> ìThis legislation puts the safety of our patients first by ensuring that important information in death records is available to the public,î said Perdue. ìBy increasing transparency, we will make state facilities more accountable to the people in their care, restore public confidence and rebuild public trust.î

> Senate Bill 799 will require the following information regarding deaths in state facilities to be public information:

> - The name, sex, age and date of birth of the deceased;†
> - The name of the facility providing the report;†
> - The date, time and location of the death;†
> - A brief description of the circumstances of death, including the manner of death if known; and†
> - A list of all entities to whom the event was reported.

> ìMore disclosure can shine a light on problems and help ensure patientsí safety.† Our investigators and prosecutors will continue to enforce the law against those who abuse patients in state facilities,î said Cooper.

> ìTransforming the stateís facilities into a true system of care is foremost, and part of that transformation means operating in a climate of transparency.î said DHHS Secretary Lanier Cansler. ìWhile we want to make sure we protect the rights of the individuals we serve, we also want to make sure the public has access to information about our facilities and our plans to correct areas of deficiencies.î

> North Carolina to Receive $8.8 Million to Help Citizens Buy Energy-Efficient Appliances

Gov. Bev Perdue this week†announced that North Carolina is in line to receive $8.8 million in federal funds to help homeowners purchase energy-efficient appliances, from furnaces and room air conditioners to refrigerators and dishwashers.† The money for ENERGY STAR rated appliances would be distributed through a program to be developed by the Energy Office along with the N.C. Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.

> The funds are part of nearly $300 million from the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act being distributed nationwide by the U.S. Department of Energy.

> ìAffordable, energy efficient appliances are not only good for the environment, they cut energy costs for consumers and create more business for retailers,î said Perdue. ìThese recovery funds will help boost our green economy, and make North Carolina a more environmentally friendly state.î

> The federal Energy Department is recommending that states focus the rebate program efforts on heating and cooling equipment, appliances and water heaters, since these products offer the greatest energy saving potential.

> In addition, the state and federal government offer tax advantages on the purchase of some major home appliances.† North Carolina also offers a sales tax free holiday weekend on the purchase of some ENERGY STAR products.† This year it is scheduled for Friday, Nov. 6, through Sunday, Nov. 8.

> For more information on the federal ENERGY STAR rebate program, visit <http://www.energy.gov/recovery>www.energy.gov/recovery.†

> For more information on North Carolinaís†Recovery effort, visit†<http://www.NCRecovery.gov>www.NCRecovery.gov.

> Gov. Perdue Calls for Closer Safety Oversight of Coal Ash Ponds

Gov. Perdue this week†urged state lawmakers to pass legislation that would increase the safety oversight of coal ash ponds in North Carolina.† The legislation would subject the dams that create coal ash ponds to direct inspection by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources.

> ìBecause of where some of the ponds are located, greater safety oversight and more frequent inspections will help reduce potential risks,î said Perdue.

> A ìhigh hazardî designation was created in the 1980ís for coal ash impoundments and other similar dams that are near densely populated areas or downstream water supplies because of the potential impact of a damís failure.† The designation does not reflect the structural condition of the dam.

> Currently, power companies are only required to file reports every five years by private engineers on the structural conditions of the dams.† The impoundments are exempt from regulation under the N.C. Dam Safety Act.

> The proposal will be sponsored by Rep. Pricey Harrison of Greensboro and will subject coal ash dams to the Dam Safety Act, which would more closely regulate the impoundments and would require a state inspection every two years.

> Anson County Manufacturer to Add 65 Jobs

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced that Yale Industrial Products Inc., a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of material-handling products, will expand operations in Wadesboro.† The company plans to invest $3 million and create 65 jobs during the next three years.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $116,300 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

> ìNorth Carolina remains a strong, diverse industrial manufacturing region,î Perdue said. ìOur state is attractive to companies looking for opportunities provided by our skilled workforce, business-friendly climate and tremendous quality of life.î

> Yale Industrial Products Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbus McKinnon Corp. of New York (NASDAQ: CMCO), which makes powered and manual hoists, trolleys, cranes and other material-handling equipment for diverse applications worldwide. Columbus McKinnon also owns Duff-Norton, a separate manufacturing facility in Charlotte.

Subject: Appeal of Judge's Superintendent Decision

Comment: Governor Perdue: My question is - if you appeal the decision of the courts to uphold June Atkinson as Superintendent of Public Schools, who will fund the appeal? If you file the appeal, I think you should pay for it - either you or Dr. Harrison. The State of North Carolina is so deeply in debt that everyday I watch the news and see you appealing to the legislature to pass tax increases to cover the state's expenses. This is an unnecessary expense, so I truly believe that whoever requests an appeal of this decision should be financially responsible, NOT the taxpayers of the state of North Carolina.

Subject: Concern regarding establishment of DPI CEO

Comment: Governor Purdue, I respecrfully submit my diasppointment in your actions that resulted in the hiring of Dr. Bill Harrison at an exhorbitant salary and stripping June Atkinson of her elected duties. I have worked for the state of NC for over thirty years as an employee of Cumberland County Schools. I voted for June Atkinson and resent your audacity to simply shove her out of your way at at time that our state is in a "supposedly" finacial crisis that you CHOSE to balance on the backs of state employess while offering a job to someone at twice the elected official's salary!! Shame on you!! Dr. Harrison needs to go and maybe you should go with him!!! Yes, I am more than angry and by the way did not vote for you.

Subject: Appeal of the decision on June Atkinson

Comment: I think it was a just decision that Ms. Atkinson be permitted to function in the role for which she was elected. Additionally, in a time of financial crisis in the state, I didn't feel it was wise to pay another large salary to have a new position, especially when it overlapped and even usurped J. Atkinson's role. Now we taxpayers are being asked to pay for an APPEAL? Let the decision stand; let her do the job, call off the appeal (to save significant money from an unwise use) and let's move on to other business of the state. There is lots more important work for you, the governor to be attending. I do appreciate your energetic attack on the financial issues of running the state, and your pledge to openness, and overcoming the unfortunate mishandling of affairs in the previous administration. Thank you for considering my concerns. (Actually those of both my husband and me, and others to whom I have spoken about the matter.)

Dear†Governor Perdue,

Last week, I sent an email urging you to drop the appeal in the case. I said the issue looks like a power grab.

I read in today's paper that Mr. Harrison agrees, saying†the appeal†would be a distraction. I am tickled he agrees with me.

When I read that Mr. Harrison is paid over twice Ms Atkinson's salary, I couldn't believe it.

How do you justify that? That not only appears to be a power grab, but raises the question of why. Is he really that good? How do you know?†Is he a long time buddy? Is he someone who agrees with you and there's some policy disagreement with Ms Atkinson?

In the context of NC's recent past, you should have been savvy enough politically to see this as a problem.

There is no way, in my mind, you can justify paying Mr. Harrison $265,000 for a contrived, connived(?) position when the people of NC elected Ms Atkinson to lead the department. I wonder if he would take the position of "senior advisor" for $120,000.

In this issue, I don't care whether Ms Atkinson is even competent. Your actions in this matter tell the people of NC, " I don't care what you say or who you voted for. I want this and I will have it". The arrogance is palpable.

Please, correct this. It looks awful.

I support you generally and stand ready to discuss and help...but I've only been retired† about a year and won't go back to work.

Sincerely,

Joel M. Wolf

Subject: Education & Health Care

Comment: As a former educator, I am appalled at the money being wasted for Harrison's salary. Why vote if elected officials choose to appoint someone of their choosing and pay them a higher salary than that of the elected official. We, the people, chose June Atkinson as Supt. Public Instruction & that is who should make the decisions. This appointment of Harrison sounds like more Easley politics. AS FAR AS HEALTH CARE IS CONCERNED, I HAVE ALREADY BEEN SHORT CHANGED ON MY STATE HEALTH PLAN (RETIRED EDUCATOR) & I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT YOU DO NOT SUPPORT OBAMA'S HEALTH CARE PLAN--OUT STATE IS ALREADY DROWNING IN UNNECESSARY DEBT, & OBAMA'S PLAN WILL ONLY "SADDLE" OUR STATE W/MORE MANDATES.

First I wanted to congratulate you on the correct ruling regarding a CEO for the schools.† I am sure you are getting numerous emails and the like with congratulations.†

Secondly, I saw on WRAL that the possibility of the CEO staying even if they do not appeal the decision is something that is in discussion.† My question is why?

Governor Perdue has been preaching to all of NC about the budget deficit and how we need to cut the budget.† Why can't we cut a position that was never there in the first place?† Why can't we cut a position that was nothing more than payback for Gov. Perdue's vote?

All of these cuts they are talking about in education and yet one administrative position that would employ at least 10 teachers†can't be cut?† I find it offensive to my intelligence that departments that are being cut are the ones bulking up their administration with six figure salaries.† I also find it offensive that these positions can be added without a second thought and yet state employees making 30, 40, or 50k per year are having to incur cuts to their pay cuts and health benefits are increasing in costs to them.

I am not alone in my disgust and outrage on this superfluous spending of taxpayers money.† If you were to read the comments on WRAL, News and Observer and other medias you will find I am actually in the majority on this.† Read the comments posted after an article and you will get a feel for how†North Carolina citizens really feel about the wasteful spending, the appointment of new positions for no reason and the way in which we, as†citizens, are being treated.† †We are NOT lacking in intelligence or the ability to read between the lines.

Please start treating us the way we deserve to be treated; individuals that elected you into office and individuals that are tired of seeing "politics as usual".† The reason that would be in your best interest is because in 3 and a half years we will still be voting and how we are treated will determine WHO we vote for.

Subject: CEO appointment

Comment: Governor Purdue, recently you stated with your hand on your family's bible that, ‚ÄúI do solemnly and sincerely swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to the State of North Carolina, and to the constitutional powers and authorities which are or may be established for the government thereof; and that I will endeavor to support, maintain and defend the Constitution of said State, not inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States, to the best of my knowledge and ability; so help me God.‚Äù Which part of this statement do you think applies to your decision to appoint a CEO of Education, which is in direct conflict with the Constitution of North Carolina? Article I, Sec. 35 states: ‚ÄúA frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is absolutely necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty.‚Äù Thank God our Judicial Branch has read this section. Your attempt at centralization of power is beyond belief. Voting is our last true measure of freedom left to the people of this nation and our great state. Give back to the state of North Carolina the money you have given to Mr. Harrison and Do Not spend one penny of our money on an appeal for your illegal act. If you want to challenge the constitution of our state then do it with you and your family's money. We elected you and pay you to govern our state, not extend some self appointed favors to your friends whom are evidently helping with this attempt to become all powerful. This reminds me of the legislation that allowed forced annexation of citizens by cities without voting privileges, All of you so called "Thinkers" should well remember that you are given power by the consent of the people. Why should the citizens have to sue you and your office for a failure to follow your oath of office?

Subject: Bill Harrison

Comment: You overstepped your authority, and also in less than 2 months vacated your oath of office by intentionally usurping the authority of a Constitutional Officer of the state, that was duly elected by the voters, of which I was one. You put Bill Richardson in the place he is now. From here on out, he will be nothing but a reminder of the power play that you attempted, and failed at. Everyday he will be a reminded to the elected head of our school system, and he will also serve on a daily basis as a reminder to the public. You know the Mary Easley fiasco, and the other patronage jobs that Mike provided, but this is worse, far worse. You attempted a coup at DPI by installing your own person. What's next, appointing "Chief Law enforcement Officers" for counties and putting them over the Sheriff? Also, over $200K a year, are you serious? He had better be able to do the work of 10 people, and those 10 need to be fired, or him one, but you already know my opinion on that one. Now will be the time that we see if we have a fresh face in politics, or Mike Ealey in a skirt. My guess is after the middle of the night lottery vote with a no vote in the hospital, and your approval of the tactics used to pass it, emails have already been deleted and documents shredded.

Dear Governor Perdue:

I am writing to you about the totally superfluous position of Education CEO held by Mr. William Harrison.† When I voted in the fall election, I voted for June Atkinson to be the Superintendent of the Department of Public Instruction.† She was elected.† I see no reason to have a CEO of Education who makes more money than our duly elected official.† Now, a judge has ruled that Ms. Atkinson is, indeed, the person who is in charge of the schools.† My question is:† When will Mr. Harrison be dismissed?

I am a retired Wake County Public School System employee.† Recently, the music teacher at the school from which I retired emailed me to let me know that she had lost her job.† She has worked for the school system for 12 years, but because she was employed at 80% instead of 100%, she was told that she would not be rehired next year.† Principals were not give a choice.† They were told to inform all teachers employed at less than 100% that they would not be rehired.† Now, many, probably most, of those who choose part-time employment are women who do so because of family obligations.† This does not mean that they are not good teachers.† Most of them have, as my friend, worked for many years and are highly respected by their peers and loved by their students.† This arbitrary across-the-board dismissal of one segment of the teaching population without regard to qualifications smacks of discimination against one group (women) and is certainly not "in the best interest of the students."† I mention that because Mr. Harrison was quoted in today's N&O as saying that he would act "in the best interest of the students" as he made his decision about what to do next.† If he really means that, he will resign immediately and gracefully.† But I'm not counting on it.† Moreover, it should not be his decision to make.†

Mr. Harrison's $265,000 salary is a travesty and needs to be used to serve the school children of this state, not to pay someone to do a job that was made up just for him.†

By the way, I voted for you.† That's a decision I regret at this time.† It's up to you to make me change my mind.


Sincerely,

Nancy H. McCarthy

Comment: I am so disappointed in the governor. What an amazing waste of money it was to appoint a CEO of Education and we have an elected person already being paid to do the job. Then pay this COE twice the amount??? Now the courts tell us you screwed up and it is all for not, but the cost and time wasted are already gone. Bev Perdue should pay all the money back to us good people of NC. Plus I hear you may appeal the ruuling costing even more of my money?? What a shame, one of your first task on the job and you blew it Bev. Now, you are just a thief like those before you in my eyes. God I hope the next three years go by fast! Guess that guy that ran against you was correct, just push the easy button Bev!

This is State Government absurdity. How many more of these boondoggles are there. When we get earnings reduction in our home we reduce spending, we don't have anyone to tax to keep our spending up.

Comment: I am writing as a citizen of NC to oppose ANY tax increase of ANY kind no matter how ‚Äúdisguised‚Äù as ‚Äòtemporary‚Äô, only for certain ‚Äòincomes‚Äô, etc. Find another way such as slashing programs. For example, why was it determined that we need a $260,000 a year CEO of Public Instruction when I voted to elect a very qualified individual in June Atkinson? I understand he has resigned as of today, but his hiring was totally unnecessary. This may not mean anything to you, but if you approve any kind of tax increase, I will NOT vote for you in the next election and I will actively campaign to encourage others to do the same including supporting other candidates financially.
