Subject: JUST SAY NO TO NC BEACH PLAN REFORM

Comment: JUST SAY NO TO NC BEACH PLAN REFORM: I just got a letter from my insurance company saying they are working with the NC Legislature for Beach Plan "REFORM." This is the worst kind of SHAM. What a surprise? Insurance companies have a $73 billion shortfall in the state and want to raise rates now -- in case there is a hurricane. What lunacy!! There's always a threat of a hurricane along the NC coast. The timing and impetus is the insurance companies' drop in revenues due to the billions of dollars of foreclosed homes. Drop in homeownership, drop in insurance premiums. What lunacy to try and raise rates when existing homeowners are already "treading water" just to get through this depression tsunami now. Let them tread water along with the rest of us -- not sink us to save them. Raising insurance premiums won't help existing or potential new homeowners. And it sure won't get any votes come the next election.

Subject: Fixing the Beach Plan

Comment: Clement Hahn, Jr. 79 Woodfin Place Asheville, NC 28801-2492 July 1, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing today to ask that you please support legislation to fix the severely under funded Beach Plan, the state-backed insurance provider for high risk coastal properties. The Beach Plan currently covers $73.6 billion in property on the coast but can only pay $1.66 billion in claims. Without reform this year, a major hurricane hitting the North Carolina coast could ultimately wind up costing all North Carolina residents by: - Disrupting the insurance market which could have statewide impact on banking, real estate, economic development and employment. - Driving up insurance rates. A recent study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for all North Carolina residents. Additionally, there is a threat that coastal homeowners who are covered by the Beach Plan would see severe delays in the payments of the claims following a storm. If approved, the Beach Plan reform legislation would help stabilize the stateï¿½s coastal insurer by allowing it to build its reserves, purchase the necessary financial products to ensure solvency and allow it to fully pay its claims after a storm. Over the long-term, the legislation will also begin reducing the size of the Beach Plan, to reduce the risk it has placed on the state. In January, a legislative study committee of state lawmakers from both the coastal and inland area recognized the immediate need to fix the Beach Plan to protect the state. And the Commissioner of Insurance has repeatedly called the Beach Plan a ticking time bomb. Please support legislation to fix the Beach Plan. Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

I'm asking you, as one of our state's leaders, to come together with your colleagues, and to agree on a budget that helps North Carolinians through this difficult time and sets us up for future prosperity. To do that, we must raise a significant amount of new revenue. Thanks to your leadership and the leadership of your colleagues and predecessors, North Carolina has made wise investments in education, children's healthcare, and family stability. Now is not the time for you to retreat from these investments and others you have championed in the past. We thank you for supporting a balanced approach in your first budget by including new revenue that helped to prevent the most devastating of cuts- you are on the right track. However, the outlook for our state's children, families and communities is still grim. That's why I am asking you to work with your colleagues to put in place a budget that raises revenue in a fair and smart way. Doing so will help to preserve the vital investments in education, healthcare, and public safety that make North Carolina such a wonderful place. Thank you. Sincerely, Joyce Buffaloe 252-589-1212

My insurance company stated the state may force the companie to raise my premium in oreder to find the additiol capital that would be required to cover all property in the plan. I do not own coastal property and do not utilize the beach plan. I am appealing to your sense of decency not to let this happen. Already in the past year I have seen my property taxes double, and fear the worst regarding my income taxes since the state is doing such a poor job managing funds. I would like a response regarding what course of action your office plans on taking regarding this issue. Regards, Michael Cross

Content-Type: text/plain;

X-Folder: Beach Plan
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

I oppose the House Bill 1305 Beach Plan, proposed by Hugh Holliman, and consider it theft, regardless of how the NCGA and Insurance Commissioner Goodwin tries to legitimize it through general statutes which would burden all NC residents. The insurance companies are committing fraud, and our elected officials in state government are complicit. Regardless of how the commissioner and NCGA attempts to legitimize it through statutes, it is still fraudulent.

If an insurance company sells 20,000 insurance policies, they agree, by legal contract, to pay repairs if the property is damaged.  However, the insurance companies admit they do not have enough money in reserve to cover even a majority of potential claims on policies they issue. If they only have reserves to cover 999 policies, that is fraud, similar to a huge pyramid scheme. In the event of a hurricane, or large disaster, the evidence of that fraud, and the incompetence and complicity of state government , becomes extremely obvious.

The politicians of this state often receive large campaign contributions from the insurance industry. As knowing partners in this fraud, their answer is the Beach Plan, in which all residents of the state are forced to pay out the nose to cover up this corruption.

I oppose the House Bill 1305 Beach Plan, and ask the NCGA to either vote no, or motion for a substitute amendment, I propose the following simple but powerful committee substitute amendment. Â§ 58â€‘45 Repealed by session laws, 2009.

Subject: House Bill 1305

Comment: Richard Hill 2203 W. Lake Keziah Dr Southport, NC 28461-9539 July 6, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing today to ask that you please support House Bill 1305. The purpose of this bill is to fix the severely under funded Beach Plan, the state-created insurance plan for coastal homeowners. The Beach Plan currently covers $73.6 billion in property on the coast but can only pay $1.66 billion in claims. Without reform this year, a major hurricane hitting the North Carolina coast could ultimately wind up costing all North Carolina residents by: - Disrupting the insurance market which could have statewide impact on banking, real estate, economic development and employment. - Driving up insurance rates. A recent study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for all North Carolina residents. To put this into perspective, if this shortfall were covered by state funds, it would equal $1,555 for every taxpayer in North Carolina. House Bill 1305 should stabilize the states coastal insurer by: ensuring that the Beach Plan has the financial resources to pay claims; providing a strategy for the Beach Plan to minimize the financial impact of a large storm; and preserving competition and availability of homeowners insurance across the entire state. In January, a legislative study committee of state lawmakers from both the coastal and inland area recognized the immediate need to fix the Beach Plan to protect the state. And the Commissioner of Insurance has repeatedly called the Beach Plan a ticking time bomb. Please support House Bill 1305 to fix the Beach Plan. Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

I believe it is crucial that we fix the severely under funded North Carolina Beach Plan. According to information I have seen, the Beach Plan currently covers $73.6 billion in property on the coast but can only pay $1.66 billion in claims. A major hurricane hitting the North Carolina coast could ultimately wind up costing all North Carolina residents by driving up insurance rates and causing more insurance companies to exit the North Carolina market. House Bill 1305 should stabilize the state's coastal insurer by: ensuring that the Beach Plan has the financial resources to pay claims; providing a strategy for the Beach Plan to minimize the financial impact of a large storm; and preserving competition and availability of homeowners insurance across the entire state. I encourage you to support House Bill 1305 to fix the Beach Plan. Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

Subject: [Aid4Mail Trial tag #2117] House Bill 1305 Beach Plan, Resident Opposition

I oppose the House Bill 1305 Beach Plan, proposed by Hugh Holliman, and consider it theft, regardless of how the NCGA and Insurance Commissioner Goodwin tries to legitimize it through general statutes which would burden all NC residents. The insurance companies are committing fraud, and our elected officials in state government are complicit. Regardless of how the commissioner and NCGA attempts to legitimize it through statutes, it is still fraudulent.

If an insurance company sells 20,000 insurance policies, they agree, by legal contract, to pay repairs if the property is damaged.  However, the insurance companies admit they do not have enough money in reserve to cover even a majority of potential claims on policies they issue. If they only have reserves to cover 999 policies, that is fraud, similar to a huge pyramid scheme. In the event of a hurricane, or large disaster, the evidence of that fraud, and the incompetence and complicity of state government , becomes extremely obvious.

The politicians of this state often receive large campaign contributions from the insurance industry. As knowing partners in this fraud, their answer is the Beach Plan, in which all residents of the state are forced to pay out the nose to cover up this corruption.

I oppose the House Bill 1305 Beach Plan, and ask the NCGA to either vote no, or motion for a substitute amendment, I propose the following simple but powerful committee substitute amendment. Â§ 58â€‘45 Repealed by session laws, 2009.

Subject: Beach Plan

Comment: Deborah Williams 109 Cayuse Way Elizabeth City, NC 27909-8576 July 8, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing today to ask that you please support House Bill 1305. The purpose of this bill is to fix the severely under funded Beach Plan, the state-created insurance plan for coastal homeowners. The Beach Plan currently covers $73.6 billion in property on the coast but can only pay $1.66 billion in claims. Without reform this year, a major hurricane hitting the North Carolina coast could ultimately wind up costing all North Carolina residents by: - Disrupting the insurance market which could have statewide impact on banking, real estate, economic development and employment. - Driving up insurance rates. A recent study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for all North Carolina residents. To put this into perspective, if this shortfall were covered by state funds, it would equal $1,555 for every taxpayer in North Carolina. House Bill 1305 should stabilize the states coastal insurer by: ensuring that the Beach Plan has the financial resources to pay claims; providing a strategy for the Beach Plan to minimize the financial impact of a large storm; and preserving competition and availability of homeowners insurance across the entire state. In January, a legislative study committee of state lawmakers from both the coastal and inland area recognized the immediate need to fix the Beach Plan to protect the state. And the Commissioner of Insurance has repeatedly called the Beach Plan a ticking time bomb. Please support House Bill 1305 to fix the Beach Plan. Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

Comment: gaynell cummings 501 b timberwood place sanford, NC 27330-4082 July 9, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing today to ask that you please support House Bill 1305. The purpose of this bill is to fix the severely under funded Beach Plan, the state-created insurance plan for coastal homeowners. The Beach Plan currently covers $73.6 billion in property on the coast but can only pay $1.66 billion in claims. Without reform this year, a major hurricane hitting the North Carolina coast could ultimately wind up costing all North Carolina residents by: - Disrupting the insurance market which could have statewide impact on banking, real estate, economic development and employment. - Driving up insurance rates. A recent study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for all North Carolina residents. To put this into perspective, if this shortfall were covered by state funds, it would equal $1,555 for every taxpayer in North Carolina. House Bill 1305 should stabilize the states coastal insurer by: ensuring that the Beach Plan has the financial resources to pay claims; providing a strategy for the Beach Plan to minimize the financial impact of a large storm; and preserving competition and availability of homeowners insurance across the entire state.

THE FAVOR OF A REPLY IS REQUESTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It has been alleged that your "bare bones" budget  will FORCE the citizens of North Carolina to help to pay for the insurance of privately owned beach property.

That is a crazy allegation, which must be refuted immediately .  How insane would a governor have to be to propose something like that to her cash-strapped constituents?

In January, a legislative study committee of state lawmakers from both the coastal and inland area recognized the immediate need to fix the Beach Plan to protect the state. And the Commissioner of Insurance has repeatedly called the Beach Plan a ticking time bomb. Please support House Bill 1305 to fix the Beach Plan. Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

Following is the question just received:

Subject: HB 1305

Comment: Michael McGowen Po Box 1297 Albemarle, NC 28002-1297 July 9, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing today to ask that you please support House Bill 1305. The purpose of this bill is to fix the severely under funded Beach Plan, the state-created insurance plan for coastal homeowners. I have customers all across NC and feel that this plan (HB 1305) will be beneficial to everyone, not just the ones in the coastal counties. The Beach Plan currently covers $73.6 billion in property on the coast but can only pay $1.66 billion in claims. Without reform this year, a major hurricane hitting the North Carolina coast could ultimately wind up costing all North Carolina residents by: - Disrupting the insurance market which could have statewide impact on banking, real estate, economic development and employment. - Driving up insurance rates. A recent study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for all North Carolina residents. To put this into perspective, if this shortfall were covered by state funds, it would equal $1,555 for every taxpayer in North Carolina. House Bill 1305 should stabilize the states coastal insurer by: ensuring that the Beach Plan has the financial resources to pay claims; providing a strategy for the Beach Plan to minimize the financial impact of a large storm; and preserving competition and availability of homeowners insurance across the entire state. In January, a legislative study committee of state lawmakers from both the coastal and inland area recognized the immediate need to fix the Beach Plan to protect the state. And the Commissioner of Insurance has repeatedly called the Beach Plan a ticking time bomb. Please support House Bill 1305 to fix the Beach Plan. Thank you for your consideration of this matter.
