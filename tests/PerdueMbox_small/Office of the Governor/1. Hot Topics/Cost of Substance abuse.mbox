New information about how much money our state spends on the
problems caused by alcohol, tobacco and other drugs was released
this morning by the National Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse at Columbia University.

It is really shocking, because the researchers found that about
15% of ALL state government spending is for alcohol, tobacco and
other drug abuse and addiction and its consequences. The worst
part is that 94% of what states spend on substance abuse goes to
pay for the enormous but hidden burden of this problem on public
programs such as health care, criminal justice, education, child
welfare and mental health -- and less than 3% of this spending
goes for prevention and treatment. 

I urge you to take a really close look at the facts for our
state and read the report here:

http://www.jointogether.org/truecost

We can't afford to continue this crazy, upside down spending
that wastes billions in taxpayer dollars at a time when
resources are scarce and results in untold human suffering. The
new report identifies common sense, inexpensive and effective
prevention and treatment approaches that would help reduce the
costs of substance abuse and addiction.

I urge you to take leadership in developing and implementing a
strategy to move our state from enormous spending on the burden
of substance abuse to investing in effective addiction
prevention and treatment programs.

Please let me know your thoughts on this revealing report. I
would welcome the opportunity to discuss this important issue

Dear Govenor Perdue,
†††† Thank you so much for your prompt response to the bedbug letter I tacked onto your update memo.† Where you
wear the hats of many causes, my chapeaus involve answering a mental health helpline and working to build
a state-of-the-art amphitheater in Triad Park. (www.triadparkamp.com)† This regional park is the joint project of
Guilford and Forsyth Counties, one of the few ventures these two counties have been able to harmoniously work
together on.† It truly is beautiful, and the earth movers are grading for the amphitheater as I type this.
Will save you a seat for the first concert!† Shirley

This message is welcome news.† You have been working very hard for North Carolina.† Something to consider -
did you read about the plight of the gentleman who spent nearly a week in the ER of Moses Cone Hospital, under the
watchful eye of two police guards and awaiting a psychiatric bed in the hospital that was built to hold one-half
the population of Dorethea Dix and John Umstead.† As with so many without insurance coverage, this mentally ill
gentleman showed up at Cone's ER instead of The Guilford Center.† Additionally, it was sickening to hear
about the children at U mstead awaiting space in the new, small mental hospital.† I understand their Umstead room
was infested with rodents, etc.† This state again received an overall grade of D in the New Freedom Commission
on Mental Health Report (a system fragmented and in shambles).† Yet mental illness strikes one in every four families.
In talking with someone in our congressmen's office to learn how to direct soldiers struggling with PTSD as they
try to work in civilian jobs, the secretary said that these veterans must wade through so much paperwork as they
seek psychiatric care that many give up.† I told her to add to that the stigma of having a mental health
diagnosis, admitting it and seeking help.† A co-worker of a vet called Nat'l Alliance on Mental Illness to
say that her vet friend was about to lose his job and his home due to his PTSD symptoms in the workplace. She wanted an on foot advocate for him.† Shirley, NAMI Helpline

Gov. Perdue Announces†Plan to†Create Green Jobs

Governor Bev Perdue†this week†announced her energy reform package to attract businesses, create jobs and promote a strong and sustainable green economy in North Carolina. She made the announcement at the SAS Solar Farm in Cary, which provides solar-generated power to Progress Energy.
‚ÄúDeveloping our green economy is a cornerstone of my vision for North Carolina‚Äôs economic future,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said. ‚ÄúCreating green jobs and businesses is a key part of my JobsNOW initiative, and the energy reforms I am implementing will lay the foundation for North Carolina to lead the nation in green energy.‚Äù
Gov. Perdue‚Äôs energy plan refocuses state energy policymaking, makes strategic investments in North Carolina‚Äôs green economy and increases green-collar workforce development.
‚ÄúThe state that gets green right will own the next 50 years,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said. ‚ÄúI intend for North Carolina to be that state.‚Äù
Governor Perdue‚Äôs energy plan includes:
- Relocating the State Energy Office and state weatherization program to the Department of Commerce
- Reinvigorating the Energy Policy Council
- Establishing an Energy Investment Revolving Loan Fund
- Expanding the Green Business Fund
- Growing North Carolina‚Äôs green workforce
- Investing federal recovery monies for other energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in small businesses, communities and homes across North Carolina
For more details, click here.

Governor Perdue Launches JobsNOW Portal

Gov. Bev Perdue today launched the JobsNOW Portal, a user-friendly resource for job seekers, those exploring new career options, and entrepreneurs looking to start, grow or relocate a business in North Carolina.
‚ÄúJobsNOW will help get our economy back on track and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue.† ‚ÄúThe JobsNOW Portal will be a valuable tool for job seekers and businesses looking to expand or relocate.‚Äù
The JobsNOW Portal is part of Governor Perdue‚Äôs JobsNOW initiative, which brings together state agencies, local governments, business leaders and citizens to create new jobs, put people back to work and train and retrain our workers for success.†
Other JobsNOW initiatives include Perdue‚Äôs recently announced Green Energy Plan, the ‚Äú12 in 6‚Äù Worker Training Program, the Charlotte Area Workforce Recovery Plan and the N.C. Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.

Gov. Perdue Signs Legislation Prohibiting Smoking in Bars and Restaurant

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Tuesday†signed House Bill 2, which prohibits smoking in public bars and restaurants. Rep. Hugh Holliman and Sen. Bill Purcell led the efforts to pass this landmark legislation. The smoking ban will go into effect on Jan. 2, 2010, and will be enforced by local health directors.
‚ÄúThis is a historic day for North Caroli na,‚Äù said†Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúBut more important than the history that we are making is the positive impact we are having on public health. By banning smoking in our restaurants and bars, we will greatly reduce the dangers of secondhand smoke and lower health care costs for families.‚Äù
According to a report by the United States Surgeon General, secondhand smoke causes the death of approximately 50,000 citizens a year. In addition, a study prepared by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina found that exposure to secondhand smoke costs North Carolinians $289 million annually.
"I am extremely happy with this legislation becoming a reality. This is a gigantic step in improving the public health for the citizens of our great state, and I'm glad I was able to play a part in making this bill a law," said Holliman.
"This new law is a significant step for public health in North Carolina.† Restaurant and bar patrons and employees will no longer be exposed to the dangers of secondhand smoke.† I want to thank Rep. Holliman for all his hard work in this important step forward for our state and its future," said Purcell.

Gov. Perdue Orders Highway Patrol to Implement New Travel Records Protocol

Gov. Perdue this week ordered the Department of Crime Control and Public Safety and the State Highway Patrol to implement new travel record keeping protocols for security details assigned to both the governor and lieutenant governor.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve pledged to run an open and transparent administration,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue.† ‚ÄúThis new protocol will provide clear direction for how the State Highway Patrol executive security detail collects and retains travel records.‚Äù
The new travel record form will include detailed information about each trip outside of Wake County taken by the governor or lieutenant governor when a member of the executive security detail provides protection.
‚ÄúGovernor Perdue has made it clear that her entire administration should operate with the highest standards of openness, and that‚Äôs exactly what we intend to do,‚Äù said CCPS Secretary Reuben Young.
All records will be maintained by the State Highway Patrol for four years after the governor or lieutenant governor‚Äôs term, at which point they will be transferred to state archives.

McDowell County Manufacturers†Create Jobs

Baldor Electric Co.†to Expand in Marion and Add 25 Jobs
Baldor Electric Co., an international supplier of industrial electric motors, mechanical power transmission products, drives and generators, will expand its Marion operations.† The company plans to invest $3.1 million and create 25 jobs during the next three years. The announcement was made possible in part by a $75,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
‚ÄúNorth Carolina continues to support a strong manufacturing sector offering new job opportunities,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said.† ‚ÄúOur state is attractive to growing companies like Baldor that know the value of our top business climate and skilled workforce.‚Äù
Baldor is consolidating operations by moving a large mounted roller-bearing line from Indiana to its Marion plant, adding 25 positions to the nearly 100 employees already at the facility.

New information about how much money our state spends on the
problems caused by alcohol, tobacco and other drugs was released
this morning by the National Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse at Columbia University.

It is really shocking, because the researchers found that about
15% of ALL state government spending is for alcohol, tobacco and
other drug abuse and addiction and its consequences. The worst
part is that 94% of what states spend on substance abuse goes to
pay for the enormous but hidden burden of this problem on public
programs such as health care, criminal justice, education, child
welfare and mental health -- and less than 3% of this spending
goes for prevention and treatment. 

I urge you to take a really close look at the facts for our
state and read the report here:

http://www.jointogether.org/truecost

We can't afford to continue this crazy, upside down spending
that wastes billions in taxpayer dollars at a time when
resources are scarce and results in untold human suffering. The
new report identifies common sense, inexpensive and effective
prevention and treatment approaches that would help reduce the
costs of substance abuse and addiction.

I urge you to take leadership in developing and implementing a
strategy to move our state from enormous spending on the burden
of substance abuse to investing in effective addiction
prevention and treatment programs.

Please let me know your thoughts on this revealing report. I
would welcome the opportunity to discuss this important issue
with you further.
