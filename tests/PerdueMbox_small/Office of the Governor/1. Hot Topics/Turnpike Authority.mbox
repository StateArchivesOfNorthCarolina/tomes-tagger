Subject: Dissolution of the NC Turnpike Authority

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue: I am distressed to see that a House Bill has passed to dissolve the NC Turnpike Authority and place its duties back in NCDOT. My concern surrounds the construction of the Mid Currituck Sound Bridge. The Turnpike Authority has made tremendous progress in getting this bridge built after too many years on the shelf. NCDOT is the "shelf" I am referring to in this analogy. NCDOT has been totally ineffective in its progress on the Mid Currituck Bridge, and a review of this lack of progress can be seen in documents dating back over 10 years. Please do not allow the work on this needed bridge to be affected by NCDOT. As Secretary of Build the Bridge-Preserve Our Roads, Inc., the nonprofit organization that has obtained over 20,000 signatures favoring the construction of the bridge NOW, I am ready to have all of the signatories contact your office and Senator Basnight's office to prevent NCDOT from nullifying the progress that the Turnpike Authority has made in getting this very necessary bridge moving forward. Thank you for taking the time to read my concerns. Robert D. Palombo Secretary Build the Bridge-Preserve Our Roads, Inc. www.buildthebridge.org

We have just learned that the House has sent a bill to the Senate (HB 1617) which would transfer all NC Toll Authority Projects back to the NCDOT.  
The citizens of Dare and Currituck Counties have worked hard over the last 20 years to finally reach a schedule for the construction of the Mid-Currituck Sound Bridge.  It took personal contributions from the citizens to reach this point.
This bridge is very important to the evacuation of thousands of people in case of a hurricane emergency.
PLEASE, PLEASE, do not let this happen.

Jodi Hess,
Southern Shores Town Council

As a home owner in Corolla, I'm very concerned with the bill which would put all NC Toll Authority Projects back under control of NCDOT. Such a bill could jeopardize the Mid-Currituck Sound Bridge Project, and it's construction, if turned over to the Turnpike Authority. This will be detrimental to home owners and business owners in the Corolla area. 

Please consider this before signing this bill.

To North Carolina government officials,

     To date,July 7,2009, no one has come to repair or finish what they
started in may yard. No one has had contact with me in over 3
weeks.The last thing doe was a large black tarp catching sediment as
more water flooded me was removed earlyin the morning last week.I
guess afriad I would say something to subordinate workers.Not worth
my time.However, when they removed this I lost a small amount of
protection from pooring waters,runoff, and the "continued" errosion
of my yard grass and more.
When they removed this black barrier and poles they placed straw over a
few bare areas where the grass was washed away near thier barrier..They in
no way planted any grass seed there nor did the seed and protect other
areas they stripped the grass and dirt burms off. Also the areas they
placed seed and 5 days later a blanket protector on top of it, most all
areas in mine and other yards has died. No one not even myself had thin
dead grass at the street areas.Everyone had healthy nice green yards till
you showed up.This needs to be fixed.
I am still waiting for my tort claim to be paid so I can repair all the
areas that for over 5 years you,NCDOT , had allowed to flood,errode, and
wash my thick green red rebel fescue grass seed away, along with several
truck loads of dirt, that now exposes tree roots and such.
I have asked for Mr Conti to give me a location and address to send a
summons to since his subordinate employees do not do their job they just
pass it on, so I can follow up in small claims , since he nor his
employees want to get this closed.I have gotten nothing but to stop
calling the NCDOT customer service office and leaving messages with Marsha
Crump-Service manager. All I've done is ask for her to call me with a name
address phone number of who can deal with this and stop passing it off(so
far I have dealt with 14 people) and or a name address of who to send
summons for small claims of $4863 to repair the damage NCDOT did since
April and the knowing damage they allowed for last 5-6 years to my yard.
I use to enjoy and was proud of my home and uts yard.You(NCDOT) have
destroyed that.You and your people have made me dislike my home,my yard
and my want to care what it looks like.I had and can prove the nicest
thick greenest grass on my street.It was always manicured to a T and had
the best curb appeal one could have.Now? It doesn't thanks to our great
NCDOT and they way they have abused,ruined,destroyed and devalued my home.
Never have I disliked a department or group of people so much, but NCDOT
has done it.I now have more dislike when I see workers on the road and 1
or 2 are working and the rest standing around eating up taxpayers
dollars.It is time for a change and the time is NOW!
So someone call -answer my questions?Is that to much to ask?
Sincerly,
Roger A.Hart

Governor Perdue:



I am a property owner in the northern portion of the Outer Banks. We have been waiting a long time for construction of the Mid-Currituck Sound Bridge to begin.



We are concerned that the proposed legislation to put all Toll Authority projects under the control of the NCDOT will cause delay in construction of the Mid-Currituck Sound Bridge.



The proposed bill claims an improvement in efficiency and conservation of expenditures. My experience as an Engineer has taught me that the bigger the agency, the higher the cost and the slower the progress. It may look better on paper to the accountants in the near term but in the long term the people will pay a higher price for less service.



Please give this bill your careful consideration.

Dear Gov. Purdue and Sen. Basnight,

     I own a property in Duck, NC and have been pleased with all the background work that has been done over at least 4 years in the planning of the Mid-Currituck Sound Bridge by the NC Turnpike Authority. The above noted bill proposes to merge the Turnpike Authority with the DOT, which would take over the authority of the Turnpike Authority projects. We are concerned that all of the prior work would get lost in the shuffle in this proposed transfer. If indeed the transfer can increase efficiency and save money, that is good, but we would like to see something in the bill that would guarantee that the bridge project would proceed on schedule. Can that be done?

     Thankyou for your consideration.

                                                                           Sincerely yours,

                                                                              Dr. and Mrs. James A. O’Neill, Jr.

Dear Governor Perdue:

I have owned a home in Duck, North Carolina, for twenty years, and have also been a long supporter of the Bridge. When the project was transferred to the Turnpike Authority, it appeared that progress would finally be made and the bridge built.

The current pending legislation that transfers the bridge back to the Department of Transportation makes no sense to me. The project stalled over years of delays when it was originally under NCDOT -- and the draft bill's statement that the current transfer is for "efficiency" is laughable.

If this legislation passes the Senate, I urge you to veto it and to leave the Bridge project with the Turnpike Authority.

Thank you for your attention to this issue.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I have just been advised that the NC House has sent the Senate a bill that may jeopardize the Mid-Currituck Sound Bridge Project due to the potential dissolution of the Turnpike Authority and takeover by NCDOT.

It is absolutely vital that we move ahead as expeditiously as possible on this long-overdue project.  The public safety of the northern Outer Banks cannot afford to be compromised further by bureaucratic wrangling.  Have we learned nothing from Hurricane Katrina?

Please take appropriate action immediately.

Thank you!

To The Honorable Bev Perdue:



Dear Governor Perdue:



I am writing to urge you to oppose House Bill 1617 which would eliminate the North Carolina Turnpike Authority and transfer its functions elsewhere.  As a property owner in North Carolina, we have been pleased to call North Carolina our second home.  I recognize that North Carolina is in the same position as most states and has had to take severe actions in reaction to current economic conditions.  It is natural to look at small agencies like the Turnpike Authority and assume that there is enough duplication that it can be absorbed elsewhere, however, I believe that such organizations are unique in several ways.  First, the Authority has a very specific and narrow mission which allows it to move much more quickly on its projects than if those projects were part of the Department of Transportation.  With all due respect NCDOT like most other transportation departments have thousands of projects to manage at one time and there is no question that the bureaucracy is substantial which translates into  a longer time required to complete projects. 



The second major difference is that, at least for the Mid-Currituck Sound Bridge Project, this project will generate income for the State and by most calculations will pay for itself in a matter of years.  This project has had a torturous history and it was not until the Turnpike Authority assumed responsibility, that true action occurred.  I believe this is a function of the smaller staff (23 employees according to the website) and the narrow mission.  To do anything now to disrupt the schedule would delay a project that will NOT be a drain on the State but rather increase revenues in both direct and indirect ways.



I have the privilege of sitting on Governor Tim Kaine’s Commission on Revenue Estimates and appreciate how serious the situation is for all states.  I have also served on our local school board and on a number of other boards where understanding of sound fiscal policy (including when and how to make spending cuts) was required.  Although these decisions are never easy, I believe that the result of House Bill 1617 will  cost  the State over time because of the potential income that will be generated if a project like the Mid-Currituck Sound Bridge Project stays on schedule.



Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Governor Purdue and Senator Basnight,

 I am very concerned about House bill 1617 regarding the dissolution of the Turnpike Authority. This would put the construction of the Mid-Currituck Sound Bridge either on a back burner or stop the progress that has been made to have this necessary bridge built.

  My husband and I own a house in Ocean Sands and have had to evacuate several times in the 20 years that we have owned the house due to a  hurricane heading for the Outer Banks. It was nothing short of a nightmare and had us frightened for our lives. It took us over 3 hours each time just to get to the Wright Brothers bridge. If the Mid-Currituck bridge had been there, we and all others on the Northern Outer Banks beaches could have evacuated in less than a half hour and been safe much sooner.

  Please do not let NCDOT take over responsibilities of the Turnpike Authority.

Thank you for your time,


Margery and Stephen Schechner

Dear Governor Purdue and Senator Basnight:

My name is Grayson Via and my wife and I are residents of the Outer  
Banks. I am wirting to let you know how concerned we are with HB 1617  
that would eliminate the NC Turnpike Authority and transfer it’s  
function to NCDOT. As you well know, the Mid-Currituck Sound Bridge  
Project languished for over a quarter century in the hands of NCDOT,  
and it was not until the NCTA was formed that the MCSB began to move  
forward as a public-private project. We believe that even with the  
best of intentions, eliminating the NCTA at this point will only delay  
the MCSB Project and thus delay the significant benefits that this  
bridge will have for the economy and safety of the residents of  
eastern North Carolina. Please do not support this bill.



Thank you.

Honorable Governor Perdue:
I am aware that our Town government has communicated its concern that House Bill 1617 would jeopardize the building of a Mid-Currituck bridge to provide new access to the Outer Banks. While the Town government supports this boondoggle bridge project, many of us living in the Town and County do not.
Many people and I believe that spending hundreds of millions of dollars to create new access routes is not only a waste of money, but that it will actually exacerbate the very problems that the Town purports to be trying to fix.
I could care less about the Turnpike Authority, but, if folding it into NCDOT will help squash this expensive unneeded and and damaging project, then please do everything within your power to make it so.
The current Town government does not represent the interests of all of its citizens.

Why are you picking on State employees? You have stolen our money out of our paycheck for two months and if I undertand correctly you are trying to abolish our jobs and or furlough us several time a year.  We are made to feel like the problems the State of NC are all our fault.  We are willing to do our part but this is not fair.  Have the medical field, technology field, city , county, and postal employees been asked to give up their pay or have they been furloughed?  None that I have talked to.  I am askinbg my Governor and my legislators to protect working families of this state, pass a budget by July 15 and fund essential state services.

Thank you,

Legislature Lines Their Pockets Wasting Taxpayer Dollars

State law mandates that lawmakers produce a balanced budget by July 1, but lawmakers have given themselves until July 15 to get the job done.  Legislators are at a stalemate because Senate leaders won’t agree to increasing taxes on the wealthiest North Carolina citizens. Senators are willing to stay in Raleigh, collecting their daily $104 per diem, to argue against a tax increase that averages $150 to $200 per year for wealthy North Carolinians. The Senate also seeks to avoid raising corporate taxes, while raising taxes on services like home and car repairs for families. It’s clear that Senate leaders are trying to protect the wealthy and corporations, yet harm North Carolina families who are struggling in this economy.

Gov. Bev Perdue told reporters that the House of Representatives and the Senate could cost the state $5 million per day until both chambers agree on a state budget. But it’s no wonder why the legislature can’t agree on a spending measure quickly. The longer the budget takes, the more money lawmakers earn. Rank-and-file members of the General Assembly earn $13,951 per year. While in session, legislators also receive $559 per month for expenses and a $104 per diem each day. They are also paid 29 cents per mile to travel back and forth to Jones Street.

Also in the budget debate, many vital state services on the chopping block. In bad economic times, the demand for services increases. With so many North Carolinians struggling just to put food on the table, keep a roof over their heads and try to hold onto a job, it is time that our state leaders get busy, agree upon a budget and stop wasting taxpayer money by staying in session well past the state-mandated deadline of July 1. Gov. Perdue told WRAL on July 1, “I don’t anticipate having to furlough anybody ever again this calendar year, if I can get a budget out of the General Assembly now.”

Do not delay! Pick up the phone now and call your lawmakers, budget co-chairmen and the governor to get the job done. Ask legislators to protect working families of this state, pass a budget by July 15 and fund essential state services. Contact information for your legislators can be found at <http://www.seanc.org>www.seanc.org under “Legislative Affairs.”

Dear Governor Purdue,
We are concerned that if all Turnpike Authority projects that includes the Mid-Currituck Sound Bridge Project are turned over to DOT the MCSBP will be jeopardized in the transition.  Over the weekend of July 4 at 1530 it took me 45 minutes to cover 4 miles on RT 12 to DUCK.   The MCSBP will assure the road to Corolla doesn't get jammed like that on cottage transition days or when a hurricane evacuation is ordered.   Please don't support this house bill.   In terms of an age old adage "If it is not broken don't fix it".    In advance thank you for your consideration.

Dear Governor Perdue,

As a resident of Southern Shores, N.C.(Outer Banks) I am apposed to the possible 'change over' in the regulatory
over seeing of the Turnpike Authority by the NCDOT.

We on the Outer Banks have had our daily lives disrupted for years by the steady, unrelentless tourist traffic passing through our residential streets. 

Houndreds of citizens have put in houndreds of hours trying to solve this problem and the MCCB Project was and is the best viable solution to our problem. 
Working with the Turnpike Authority a plan was developed and building the long awaited Bridge became a reality.

NOW, this possible regrouping in athorities will have devestating results on the plan to build the much needed bridge.  The dedicated work by so many people and the cooperation of the Turnpike Authority will be for naught!!

THAT WOULD BE A SHAME AND A DISCRACE.  AN INSULT TO ALL OF THE CITIZENS OF THE OUTER BANKS, WHO WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO BE DISTURBED BY THIS RELENTLESS TRAFFIC, IN SOME CASES, PASSING IN FRONT OF OUR OWN HOMES!

Please do not 'change the horses in the middle of the stream'.  The repercussions could be far worse than expected.

Thank you and Sincerely,

Governor Perdue,

Please support the construction of the mid-Currituck bridge.

As you may know, there are no schools in the eastern portion of Currituck, and therefore it is only a summer destination area.  The bridge will allow families to move there and a community to develop

As currently proposed, the bridge is entirely funded through tolls.

Additionally, it would be a great use of Obama money, which could actually BE PAID BACK.  Another option would be for Obama to add credit support to the bonds that are sold to finance the bridge.

In any event, please do what you can to help make the bridge a reality and grow the great state of North Carolina.

thanks,

Sam Cortez

Our offices are not in favor of dissolving the turnpike authority, particularly in light of the potential unfavorable impact of this action on the construction of the mid county Currituck bridge between the mainland and Corolla………too much has been done at this point.

I am completely opposed to the NCDOT taking over the Turnpike Authority.  It should remain as it is currently.

Thank You,

Dear Governor Purdue and Senator Basnight;

I am a property owner in Currituck County.

I was dismayed to recently discover that a proposed Senate bill would put all North Carolina Toll Authority Projects back under the control of NCDOT.  I am opposed to this bill as I believe that it could jeopardize the Mid Currituck Sound Bridge Project.  Such a change would result in the possible dissolution of the Turnpike Authority, jeopardizing the progress of the Mid Currituck Sound Bridge.  The bridge is an important part of Currituck County's future and needs to be built on schedule.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

DJ Miller
Property owner in Currituck County

Governor Purdue.  Thank you for all you are doing. I would like to express my concern about the proposed bill to have the Turnpike Authority come under the NCDOT.  If this agency has to come under the huge bureaucracy of the NCDOT, the projects in the pipeline could be delayed or worse, be put on hold indefinitely.  The Mid Currituck Bridge project has been moving along well.  Change in the agency structure could severely impede this progress.  Thank you,

Inman, James



Dear James :



Thank you for your recent email and for sharing your thoughts and ideas regarding Revenue Plan for the 2009-2011 North Carolina budget.  I appreciate hearing from North Carolinaâ€™s engaged citizens about issues that are important to all of us.



Due to the national economic crisis, our state faces a budget shortfall of nearly $5 billion next year, almost 20 per cent of our entire budget.  In these very difficult times, we are making some very tough decisions to deal with the significant budget shortfall.  While I am constitutionally bound to balance the budget, I am considering each choice very carefully, and I am always aware of the consequences of my decisions.  I will keep your ideas in mind as we work to improve the quality of life in North Carolina.



I encourage you to speak with your representatives in the NC General Assembly and follow the budget process as it develops by visiting <https://mail.nc.gov/owa/redir.aspx?C=5e2edd4fe7314415a624ae2b82289c22&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ncleg.net%2f>www.ncleg.net
