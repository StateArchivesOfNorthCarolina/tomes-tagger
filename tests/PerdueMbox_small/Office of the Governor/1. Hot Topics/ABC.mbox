Subject: ABC Boards

Comment: I was wondering what the Governor's stance is on how alcohol is sold in the state. I saw something mentioned on the internet that she would like to increase the state's control over ABC. However, I've now heard a rumor that she thinks it should be privatized. Could you tell me which is true? Or if neither is true? Thanks in advance for your time. Melissa

Subject: ABC Stores New Hanover County

Comment: in recent news the ABC Stores in New Hanover County has been making news on the salary of the Manager and his son $400,000.00 between them. When I read how state governments are cutting back on expenses we pay our ABC this large amount of salary. I think this needs to be investigated. I would much rather have teachers, firepersonal and police vs this ABC Manager and son. When I heard they were givin a 7% increase in July I was surprised. They said it was because the sales were up 14% thats really good in an industry were there is no competition because it is state ran. Thank you for letting me vent on this matter

To Our County Commissioners:

The pillage of our tax dollars at the ABC Board has to STOP!

The first thing is that both Williams should be fired/removed. They have failed to do their jobs - to work for the PUBLIC's INTEREST.

Pay rates should be strictly stated and limited. No nepotism - period. No bonuses for doing your job (!)

The argument that they do a better job than average is laughable. The product sells itself with no competition. Prices are set by the State Board as are most policies.

And to say you can't do anything about it except appoint new Board members is not accurate. You can ask explicitly and publicly for resignations!! From the whole Board and the Administrators!!

The voters are watching to see what you do.

I could not agree more. †Immediate action should be taken to replace the board and change the salaries back to a more reasonable level, and if they don't accept it then they should be removed immediately. †Everyone I talked to is appalled and of the same opinion.

Joe -
I agree completely - I was very disappointed / disgusted with the commissioners and boards attitude that they would not allow this IF it had not already escaped their control. The premise that they cannot - undue this calamity is warped.†
Its a bit like saying we have already†run over the taxpayers - its too late to put on the brakes - but we will honk the horn - to let them know who is in the drivers seat.
We should all take note of who is in the drivers seat and reward this poor behavior!
We are without serious leadership. We deserve better from our commissioners to control cost and ensure that the precious taxes we pay are utilized effectively in the community. I concur with your appeal and extend the concern to all staff, boards and contractors that profit from our community of tax payers. The Community Water Boards comes to mind.
Can someone point me to the County budget and a listing of the 2009/2010 cost plans for New Hanover County?
We done Joe - this behavior is a cry for help from our commissioners - they are acting like the wayward teenager that need strong adult guidance from the citizen taxpayers.
Lets provide a strong voice to provide that guidance!

To the New Hanover County Commissioners:

As the ABC commissioners continue to "thumb their noses" at both you and the public; acting as though they are untouchable and cannot be removed. I urge you to please review the attached document.

In particular, please note†the statement below:

"Qualifications: Appointed on the basis of appointee's interest in public affairs, good judgment, knowledge, ability and good moral character."

I believe that this whole situation with the Williams' compensation and nepotism†is clearly a dereliction of their duties. In addition, them failing to tell you of bonus' given because as Mr. Culbreth stated, "you didn't ask" is an embarrassment.

I feel this is more than just cause for them to be removed from office and†replaced with members who truly are acting in the best interest of the public.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Nick Carnevale

Subject: alternative use for ABC outlets

Comment: as the wave of medicinal marijuana legalization slowly spreads across the USA. and with NC haveing the Delivery system in place all ready for the ABC stores. NC could piggy back the sale of medicinal marijuana into the ABC stores. at a HUGE cost savings.of not haveing to lay out money to set up stores.. its just some thing to think about.with privatizing the ABC system the state might lose a outlet to control the sale of medicinal marijuana...

Comment: Well, let's see now. More than 160 ABC boards in NC. From their web site, it appears about two-thirds of the boards have four members, and the remainder have anywhere from three to eleven members. I estimate the average is five members. Using the New Hanover County ABC Board pay scale as a basis (although I suspect most boards are more generous), the members get $200 per month and the chairman gets $250, for a total of $1250 per month. For the more than 160 boards, that comes to $2,400,000 per year in board salaries alone. Add another $10 - 20 million for management salaries (the Williams duo from New Hanover County being exceptional) and you have upwards of twenty-million dollars or more in ABC Board and Board management salaries. LUDICROUS!!!! Now, consider that there are so few ALE agents enforcing State laws that enforcement is a virtual joke. Why?? The answer is obvious, of course. WE CAN'T AFFORD THEM, OF COURSE!!! Well, gee whiz, Mr. Wizard, I wonder if we took some of the bloated, self-serving, good-old-boy ABC management costs and applied them to hiring more ALE agents, we just might just have liquor law enforcement that has a few teeth in it.

Subject: ABC System

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, In Sunday's News & Observer newspaper, I read an interesting editorial from one of our citizens. He proposed the idea of privatizing the ABC system to help reduce the deficit. I thought this was an outstanding idea. As the gentleman mentioned in his editorial, he suggests $1 billion or more could possibly be saved through privatization. The state wwould continue to financially benefit by receiving revenue by requiring licenses for stores to operate as well as the tax on alcohol. The citizens would benefit from not having to pay for the cost to operate the stores and all of the associated overhead costs. This is a win-win situation for our state. I respectfully urge you to look into this matter as a means of helping to reduce the state deficit. And, I would appreciate hearing your opinion on this proposal. Sincerely, Carol Winterbourne

Subject: Two Suggestions to Save the State tons of Money

Comment: Blow away the ABC boards. They serve no useful purpose. Let the market sell liquor/wine. You eliminate millions leases and salaries. Their contention about giving back taxes is just money paid by the taxpayers up front. Secondly, there are yellow DOT trucks that drive around the States interstates with one and sometimes two people that are just looking for people with a flat tire or out of gas. There are now cell phones. Let the private market handle these breakdowns. Any basic business approach outlines that it is much more cost effective to do this on an exception basis. That is, when a car breaks down someone is called out to fix/repair/tow the unit. Having 100 if not a couple thousand state vehicles driving around looking for cars that are broken down is just dumb. You save tons of capital on getting these assets of the books, tons of running costs (including fuel), and hundreds if not thousands of headcount reductions.

Comment: Governor I voted for you because of your positions on education, ethics, and taxes. I believed in you and have waited a year for action, but can no longer hold my patience. How can you raise taxes only to then cut education and teachers salaries while you allow ABC boards across the state go unchecked and pay 100,000‚Äôs of dollars in salaries and bonuses to board members? How can you allow a corrupt DMV bilk millions from your citizens on a wasted unnecessary inspection process? You are the Governor these are two areas you can fix. Privatize the ABC now and until then cap the ABC salaries, wage increases, and bonuses to that of a master level teachers or vice principals. Stop the DMV inspection disgrace, waive all new cars for four years, increase the cycle to two years and cancel the new computer linked program that wastes hundreds of millions. It is the waste and abuse of the new program created by Eisley's thugs that brings the corruption. Cut the program and you will save the citizens from the expense and the corruption. Our great state is in serious crisis as ‚ÄúTHE EDUCATION GOVERNOR‚Äù please exhibit some leadership and clean up these two areas. You have had terrible approval ratings and are seen as ineffective, untruthful, and selling us out, just as Democratic powerbrokers Easley and Black did before. Yet you have not said a word about either one of these areas that you could fix easily and make a positive step in turning around this state and your reputation. Thank you, John

The government should not be in the liquor business!!! †I canít believe Gov Perdue is asking as per the article in N&O that the boards not accept gifts, guess the Govínor does not want to make anyone mad, they may turn up more corrupt under table buy offs to state officials.



In the most immediate response, Perdue plans to ask the 163 local boards to agree to the ban on gifts and tighter ethics rules that she has imposed on state agencies under her control.

Comment: I believe it is time to do away with the ABC stores, boards and commissions and enter into the age of free enterprise. The last series of disclosures showing how some people treat ABC as their personal fiefdom and family legacy has got to be changed. I've worked for and with the federal government and we always had rules about what gratuities were allowable. A $12,000 plus dinner is not acceptable. Please move forward to get this backward practice changed.

Comment: Hello Your Excellency, I read in the Charlotte Observer, that your team wants to put a tight 'leash' on the selling of alcohol. Now, those words were not verbatim in the article, but that was the message from the article. I have a suggestion. How about stopping the selling of all alcohol in Super Markets and Drug stores throughout the state. That also means Wal-Mart too. Now, I would bet that a store like Harris and Teeter would not go along with such an idea. Wal-Mart either, but...it would help with keeping alcohol out of the hands of miners, help with curbing alcoholism. It is too easy and accessible here. See, if it is harder to find, people might not bother. Maybe. Just a thought.

> Energy Efficiency Projects Get Funding Across NC

‚ÄúMain Street‚Äù Energy Projects Approved for Recovery Funding
More than $330,000 in federal Recovery Act funds have been awarded to eight North Carolina ‚ÄúMain Street‚Äù communities to help with energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives.† The grants are the first distribution of money from the North Carolina Energy Program for the state‚Äôs Main Street initiative.
‚ÄúNorth Carolina continues to use recovery funds for job creation and energy efficiency,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue.† ‚ÄúThese grants will provide service jobs for local businesses and help local communities save money on utility bills.‚Äù
The Main Street initiative seeks to boost economic development in small towns, including those in rural areas that have been designated by the N.C. Commerce Department‚Äôs Division of Community Assistance.† A second round of grants is expected to be awarded during the first quarter of this year.
The North Carolina Energy Office, in partnership with the N.C. Main Street Center, awards grants to eligible local governments and/or nonprofit downtown revitalization organizations for projects totaling no more than $250,000.† Grants are awarded to Main Street communities for energy audits and planning and policy work to support long-term sustainable changes for energy efficiency.
Local matching funds must be committed for implementation of grant awards on the basis of a minimum of one non-federal dollar for every one federal dollar from the N.C. State Energy Program Main Street Grant Fund.
<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=860>Click here for the list of†‚ÄúMain Street‚Äù projects approved for funding in the first round.

First Round of Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants Approved for Recovery Funding
More than $860,700 in federal Recovery Act funding for energy efficiency block grants will help six local agencies create jobs and save on utility and fuel bills.† The six grants mark the first distribution of money from the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant program in North Carolina.† Additional grants are expected to be announced in the coming weeks as funding applications are reviewed and acted upon.
‚ÄúOnce again, North Carolina will use recovery funds to create and sustain jobs and to help our communities be more energy efficient," said Gov. Perdue.
> †
> The grants program is administered by the North Carolina Energy Office to encourage energy conservation and economic investment in counties, municipalities, community colleges and public schools.† A total of $7.2 million is available to local government agencies and $6.3 million to public schools and community colleges.
The first six grants have been awarded to Buncombe County schools, Vance-Granville Community College, Burgaw, Elkin, Morganton and Valdese.† <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=862>Click here for more details.

New Jobs for North Carolina

Husqvarna to Add†New Headquarters and 160 Jobs in Charlotte
Husqvarna, a global leader in outdoor power equipment, will double its Charlotte workforce with the opening of a new North American headquarters. Husqvarna plans to add 160 workers over the next three years and invest $2.75 million in the project.
‚ÄúThis decision by a top international company such as Husqvarna shows what trade magazines have long said ‚Äì that Charlotte is among the nation‚Äôs best places to live and do business,‚Äù Perdue said. ‚ÄúI will continue working aggressively to create opportunities across the state that put our people to work.‚Äù
Husqvarna is based in Sweden and employs more than 15,000 workers in 42 countries. It is the world‚Äôs largest producer of chainsaws, lawn mowers and other gas-powered garden equipment such as trimmers and leaf blowers. Its products are sold in North America under many brand names including Husqvarna, Poulan, PoulanPro, Weed Eater, Dixon, Gardena and Jonsered.†
The company plans to consolidate its Consumer Outdoor Products subsidiary currently headquartered in Augusta, Ga., with its Professional Products headquarters in Charlotte to form one North American headquarters in Charlotte. While salaries will vary by job type, the overall average annual wage for the 160 new jobs will be $79,453, not including benefits. That is significantly higher than the Mecklenburg County average of $48,776.
Under the terms of the JDIG, the company is eligible to receive a grant equal to 55 percent of the state personal income withholding taxes derived from the creation of new jobs for each of the nine years in which the company meets annual performance targets. If Husqvarna meets the targets called for under the agreement and sustains them for nine years, the JDIG could yield as much as $2.5 million in maximum benefits for the company.
For more information about Husqvarna, including job opportunities, visit <http://www.husqvarna.com/>www.husqvarna.com and click on ‚ÄúHusqvarna Group‚Äù at the top of the page.

Plastics Manufacturer to Relocate Headquarters, Bring $5.7 Million Investment and 41 Jobs to Gaston County
Wilbert Plastic Services, a national supplier of molded plastic parts for the automotive, industrial equipment and custom parts markets, will expand its operations in Gaston County.† The company will relocate its headquarters from Chicago to Belmont, invest $5.7 million and create 41 jobs during the next three years.† The announcement was made possible in part by an $82,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
‚ÄúNorth Carolina continues to attract national companies seeking the best location to succeed in a highly competitive marketplace,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said.† ‚ÄúOur top-notch business climate, highly skilled workforce and tremendous quality of life are among the primary reasons businesses are choosing our state to relocate their headquarters and grow operations.‚Äù
The company plans to relocate its headquarters from the Chicago area to its Belmont facility, where operations include the molding and painting of plastic compounds, machining for metal molds and final product assembly.†
The headquarters will house executive management, finance and accounting, sales and marketing management, human resources and part of the company's engineering staff.† While salaries will vary by job function, the 41 new headquarters positions will pay an average annual wage of $94,257 not including benefits, which far exceeds the Gaston County average of $33,384.†
For more information on Wilbert Plastic Services, including job opportunities with the company,†visit <http://www.wilbertplasticservices.com/>www.wilbertplasticservices.com.

Contracts Awarded for 13 Highway Projects with Recovery Act Funds

34†contracts totaling more than $107 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including 13 projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The contracts were awarded by the N.C. Department of Transportation to the lowest bidders, as required by state law.
‚ÄúIn the new year, recovery dollars will continue to help us improve our transportation infrastructure while providing jobs to North Carolinians,‚Äù Perdue said.
According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.
The bids received on all 34 projects advertised came in 15 percent, or about $19 million, below NCDOT estimates.
For more information about†about these projects, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=859>click here.

Subject: ABC corruption

Comment: Dear Gov.Bev Perdue- These State employees of ABC liquors are the most corrupt state officials that you have in your government.It is time and your job to totally shut down the ABC system and privatize liquor sales in this state to encourage competition to help lower prices in this already bad economy.There are people out there who are surviving day to day on little to nothing and yet these corrupt board members all the way down to their employees are drinking Dom Pergion champagne and eating lobster tails at the expense of the tax payer and the already corrupt liquor salesmen.Remember that the tax payers had to pay back Diageo the money that these people have accepted as obvious bribery.Enough is enough. As a state worker myself it is an insult to the regular state employee who does not have that luxury.Do something soon before it gets out of hand.I work in your government also as a state employee and prefer to remain anonymous.I work for you already.I don't get lobster tail or bribes or Champagne.Please do your job.

Comment: Governor Perdue, I worked for Raleigh Office Supply before working with DOT for many years. I have set truckloads of new furniture in the rain as state agencies rushed to empty their budgets in July. Self preservation dictates they can not have a surplus if they want to avoid a lower budget and obtain higher. I have seen DOT's "little kingdoms" with each office a power unto itself. There is widespread nepotism. A favorite technique is for supervisors to "trade" sons and daughters for summer jobs. They invariably assist the clerk in the office. Upon graduation they always start as an Assistant Resident at $41,000 to occupy an office and play Tetris on their calculator. This is why DOT can no longer DO anything. They are an organization dedicated to preserving their budget while the people who actually could do something and were forced out in favor of the youngsters with useless degrees now work for consultant firms charging twice the price. Something in the news about a serial rapist in Fayetteville and the SBI taking 1.5 years to process a DNA for a break in suspect catches my attention. Madam ... the SBI has been telling us "We're working hard to reduce the backlog" for too many years. Let's put some regulatory budget oversight on ABC and take that money to train some moderately intelligent people to do the technical task of processing DNA in a timely manner to make NC safer? I don't see a degree being required ... only a certification.

Comment: I would urge our state to continue with current ABC stores as they are, and not give the sales to private contractors. I would not trust "contractors", to not sell spirits to underage citizens. As the old saying goes, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". If the board in my county were taken out to lunch by a liquor company, I would say they probably deserved a nice meal. I've never seen an ABC employee standing at the door telling customers what they should buy. Keep up the good work!

Comment: Like other Charlotte residents, I am outraged my Parks Helms actions. However, one must note that this problem would not have happened had NC adopted SC's policy of privatizing liquor sales. It is time for NC to join the 21st century and privatize liquor sales.

Comment: I agree with Pat McCrory's view of the NC ABC system. Having lived in NY State and Virginia with private and government run systems of dispensing; I know the private businesses provide a much better variety, especially compared to NC ABC's.

Comment: Seems to me that the ABC system needs to be scrapped and private business take it over. If what I read is true about the state taking in $700 million more in tax revenue, from this being done, it needs to happen. Can't imagine this great state not doing that. The 1930s are well in our rear view mirror and it's time to step up and generate as much revenue as is possible from alcohol. Up the sin tax on it and pull in even more money. We need, our kids need our roads need it. Just common sense and Parks Helms should know better. Time to change it Governor. Jam it through the upcoming short session.

Madam Governor and elected officials:

I noticed on the news yesterday that you are becoming interested in making our state more efficient, in order that we can better compete with other states and countries.

I have also been keeping up with our current and past problems in the state with local Alcohol Control Boards.

Madam Governor, just place the sale of liquor in the grocery stores!† You would elimate the bureaucracy and improve efficiency.† You are currentlyselling beer and wine in the grocery stores, other states sell in grocery stores!

There is alot of room for savings for state and local government here.† I'm sure that some would hollar that these liquor store employees will loose their jobs.† I respectfully argue that we have lost tons of manufacturing jobs and few people seem to be hollering about their jobs except you, Madam Governor and me.

Content-Type: text/plain;

X-Folder: ABC

There are two more things that should be added to your 2010 Agenda:† (1.) †instead of spending any more taxpayer dollars on investigations and checking of salaries of people connected to the ABC board, it must just be abolished.† The sale of liquor should be a private business transaction while we just collect the taxes on it.† We have a great deal of state money tied up in valuable properties; sell them or at least lease them until sold and get North Carolina out of the alcohol sales business!



(2.)† We HAVE to come up with a feasible solution that works regarding the special parking spaces for persons with disabilities.† It is just as much a crime for an individual not needing the extra wide space to park in it as it is to rob a†person of anything else!†† Those extra wide spaces are a necessity for a person†using a wheelchair since they need to open up their door all the way so the chair can be brought right next to the seat of the car.† (I know whereof I speak as my†daughter is a paraplegic and in a wheelchair since she was 7; almost 43 years ago, and has been driving alone with hand controls since she was 16.)†††The majority of time†she cannot find a vacant handicapped space, therefore requiring her to utilize a regular narrow space and parking way to one side of the space which angers some†adjoining parkers.† We did not have a handicapped placard before she got her license (and never have had one even with my spinal surgery, hip replacement, etc.)† We would†stop somewhere and take her out of the car and then repark the car; it certainly can be done by everyone with a non-driving person with a disability.† It seems to me that someone†is giving these placards out indiscriminately†but whatever method is used to get these placards into the hands of people not needing them is horribly wrong!† My daughter has the special license plate and perhaps requiring them instead of a placard for a person with a permanent disability would help.† So many fewer spaces would be required if the wrong people didn't park in them.† We all want to leave this world a better place and my goal is to see handicapped parking spaces only used by persons needing the wider spaces.†



Thank you.

Dear Governor Purdue,

I urge you to NOT go forward with the proposed port in Southport.

NO AMOUNT of jobs can offset the tremendous negative impact on quality of
life for all the residents of the Southport area.

Studies have found that the illness and death rates in and around large
port areas are MANY times greater than normal.

You have the opportunity to make history and be known as the leader of
North Carolina who put the people of small communities FIRST to protect us
from the negative effects of such a large facility and all it's supporting
services.

It can be your LEGACY!

Respectfully,

|Gov. Perdue Announces 2010 Agenda                                                |
|Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday announced her major policy priorities for the coming|
|year ‚Äì jobs and the economy, education, setting government straight, and keeping |
|communities safe.  Gov. Perdue‚Äôs goals in each of these areas will help North    |
|Carolina emerge from the economic recession stronger than before.  Governor      |
|Perdue outlined her initiatives during speeches to the Charlotte Chamber and the |
|Greensboro Partnership this week.                                                |
|For Gov. Perdue, keeping and growing jobs in North Carolina is her No.1 priority |
|‚Äì and she recognizes the need for North Carolina to focus its economic           |
|development efforts not only on large companies, but also on the small businesses|
|that make up 98% of all state businesses.                                        |
|During her address, she announced the launch of a statewide small business       |
|initiative called Biz Boost.  Biz Boost will help small businesses apply for     |
|credit, work on staffing, manage cash, and reduced costs.  It will give small    |
|businesses access to the same kind of outside talent that big businesses often   |
|use to help them adapt and grow.  The initiative has been successfully piloted   |
|already in Charlotte and will be replicated statewide through the Department of  |
|Commerce and the NC Small Business and Technology Development Center (SBTDC).    |
|Also, Gov. Perdue announced that during the spring legislative session she will  |
|propose tax incentives for small businesses that are born in North Carolina ‚Äì    |
|create jobs in North Carolina ‚Äì and stay in North Carolina.                      |
|‚ÄúWe must grow our own jobs and invest in our own businesses.  We must strengthen |
|the heart and soul of North Carolina‚Äôs economy: innovation and small business,‚Äù  |
|said Gov. Perdue.                                                                |
|In addition to her economic agenda, Gov. Perdue set out her agenda for education |
|and government reform.                                                           |
|‚Ä¢ Career and College ‚Äì Ready, Set, Go! will refocus our state‚Äôs public schools on|
|a single goal: every student, no matter where he or she live in North Carolina,  |
|must graduate from high school with what it takes to succeed in a career, in a   |
|two- or four-year college or technical training.                                 |
|‚Ä¢ Setting Government Straight:  Strengthening ethics policies, zero-tolerance for|
|unethical and illegal behavior, eliminating outdated programs and fighting waste,|
|fraud and abuse including cracking down on Medicaid fraud.                       |
|‚Ä¢ Keeping Communities Safe:  continue taking steps to reform and strengthen      |
|public safety.                                                                   |
|‚ÄúI pledge to take reform to the next level.  We will set government straight by  |
|cracking down on corruption ‚Äî strengthening ethics ‚Äî and fighting waste, fraud   |
|and abuse,‚Äù said Perdue.  ‚ÄúWe will set government straight by tightening our     |
|belts and doing more with less ‚Äî just like families and businesses are doing all |
|across North Carolina.‚Äù                                                          |
|Gov. Perdue Announces New Education Agenda                                       |
|Gov. Perdue on Wednesday announced her new education agenda, Career and College ‚Äì|
|Ready, Set, Go!, in a speech to a Joint Session of North Carolina‚Äôs Educational  |
|Governing Boards in Kannapolis.  Gov. Perdue outlined a framework to take on the |
|educational challenges facing our state with the goal of preparing every student |
|to be college or career ready after graduating from high school.                 |
|‚ÄúWe must re-focus our state‚Äôs public schools on a single goal.  Every kid ‚Äì no   |
|matter where he or she lives in North Carolina ‚Äì must graduate from high school  |
|with what it really takes to succeed in a career, in a two- or four-year college |
|or technical training,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue.  ‚ÄúThat means no more losing out on jobs|
|that require more than low skills and no more remedial courses in college.       |
|Graduates will have what it really takes.‚Äù                                       |
|North Carolina‚Äôs Educational Governing Boards ‚Äì including the State Board of     |
|Education, the UNC Board of Governors, the N.C. State Board of Community Colleges|
|and the N.C. Independent Colleges & Universities Board of Directors ‚Äì are        |
|critical partners in Gov. Perdue‚Äôs plans for education in our state.  They have  |
|the ability to set policies that will work together to achieve student readiness.|
|Gov. Perdue‚Äôs education agenda will work in three steps:                         |
|Ready - Increasing the number of students who can read, write and do math by the |
|end of third grade.                                                              |
|Set - Increasing the number of students that perform at or above grade level.    |
|Go - Increasing the number of students taking college credit courses in high     |
|school; graduating from high school; going to college; and completing their      |
|degree from a community college, college or university.                          |
|Specific policy highlights include:                                              |
|- Incentives for great teachers in hard to staff schools and content areas       |
|- Leadership Academy for school leaders                                          |
|- Restructure the ABC‚Äôs program to include diagnostic assessment, 21st century   |
|skills and national assessments so we can see how our students compare to others |
|across the nation and world                                                      |
|- Adopt the Common Core national standards: everyone agrees on the skills that   |
|all students need to know to graduate ready to work, go to college or vocational |
|school                                                                           |

|visits, a jump of 13 percent over the previous year, and up 5 percent from the   |
|previous record set in 2007, according to the N.C. Division of Parks and         |

|Over the past 25 years, the state parks system has seen a dramatic 238 percent   |
|increase in visitation. In 1984, 5.9 million people visited state parks and state|
|recreation areas.                                                                |
|‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obvious North Carolinians and visitors to our state recognize the          |
|tremendous value our state parks offer in terms of affordable family experiences |

|the state parks can also take pride in this state‚Äôs long history of conservation |
|of its remarkable natural resources.‚Äù                                            |
|The state parks system manages more than 208,000 acres, including 34 state parks |

|Among the parks and recreation areas, 22 reported increases in attendance in     |
|2009. Jockey‚Äôs Ridge State Park in Dare County reported the highest attendance at|
|1.4 million visits, an increase of 2 percent over last year.                     |

|‚ÄúI want to ensure that adequate supplies of home heating and vehicle fuels are   |

Visitor: Mr. Jay Farris

Address: 109 Edgehill Rd., Hendersonville, NC 28739

Email: farris6669@yahoo.com

Subject: ABC stores/bureaucracy and the budget deficite

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: I just wanted to let you know that I find the entire ABC bureaucracy to be a huge burden on the state funding and, at the same time, bordering on free enterprise. The salaries paid to these government employees a thorn in your budget chief, but the entire organization reduces competition in the liquor market and, as a result, probably reduces the revenue generated. I recommend that the ABC system be abolished and the sale of liquor be returned to the free market system; still providing tax revenue but also providing the citizens the option of getting a better deal with one distributor over another. Thank you very much! Jay and Deborah Farris, registered Democratc in Henderson County

Dear Governor Perdue:
†† † I know you are working to do whatever you can to get more jobs to North Carolina, I appreciate that very much. †I have a question and I'm not sure being new to the area, if this is already in the works. †Do you think the Raleigh area or close to it, will ever get casino's in with slots and also tables? †Many states are adding more of them, to bring in more revenue to the state. †This was just a thought of mine. †Please advise at your convenience.
Misty Ferrara

Among the parks and recreation areas, 22 reported increases in attendance in 2009. Jockey‚Äôs Ridge State Park in Dare County reported the highest attendance at 1.4 million visits, an increase of 2 percent over last year.

State of Emergency Declared to Ensure Adequate Fuel Supplies can be Delivered During Winter Cold

On Friday, Gov. Bev Perdue declared a state of emergency and temporarily suspended motor carrier regulations to ensure that transporters of essential fuels in North Carolina can operate above the maximum hours.
‚ÄúI want to ensure that adequate supplies of home heating and vehicle fuels are available to our citizens during this extended cold snap,‚Äù said Perdue, who signed Executive Order No. 43 to waive the regulations.† ‚ÄúSome areas of our mountains got more than 20 inches of snow recently and extremely cold temperatures have persisted statewide.‚Äù
The uninterrupted supply of fuel oil, diesel oil, gasoline, kerosene, propane, and liquid petroleum gas to residential and commercial establishments is essential during wintertime and any interruption in the delivery of those fuels threatens the public welfare.
<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=864>Executive Order No. 43 allows persons transporting essential fuels to operate above the†maximum hours of service. The waiver of Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations does not apply to the commercial drivers‚Äô license and insurance requirements.
The N.C. State Highway Patrol will enforce conditions outlined in the executive order.† Upon request by law enforcement officers, exempted vehicles must produce documentation sufficient to establish their loads are being used for relief efforts associated with the cold weather and winter storm.† The duration of this executive order is 30 days or until the emergency situation ends.

Comment: ABC must go! This is an archaic and inefficent means to manage the issue. Eliminate the waste of tax payer dollars by eliminating the physical ABC offices, the payroll for the nepotistic rank & file and the current & future weight of medical and retirement benefits. ABC should be managed via the private sector in cooperation with state government. This is such a clear display of waste and I hope you will utilize the recent controversy to end the ABC.

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue: Why don't you privatize the ABC board so more private sector jobs and business ownership can be created. This is how liquor is handled in many states and I do not believe there are any more DWI's in those states than here. Instead we have a scandal of corruption and the excess profits went to a few ABC individuals instead of to teacher's salaries, better schools, medicaid. I would also like to know where all the confiscations made by the sheriff's office and the police force end up. I hear about all the money they find that is drug related but I never hear one word of any good it is doing for the community.

Comment: Some ideas on how to trim the state budget: -Eliminate the Agency for Public Telecommunications. NC already has a public television network covering state government and APT unfairly competes with private business for video production services -Privatize liquor sales. The state can still tax liquor and enjoy the benefit of that revenue without the expense of the ABC bureaucracy -Match trailer registration with boat registration. I only register my boat every five years, but have to register my trailer every year. Do the trailer every five years too and you can keep the fee the same and still collect the revenue without the expense of administering registration annually. -Let private contractors do highway mowing and eliminate those DOT positions, then mow only when necessary. I've seen highway mowing in winter, when the grass isn't even growing. A huge waste. -Turn the GTP over to Lenior County. The county can still recruit industry there and the state will still benefit from the extra jobs and taxes, but it won't have to pay for the GTP's annual administrative bureaucracy.

Comment: I am a NC native who has recently moved back to my home state. I currently work in New Bern for RSM McGladrey as a CPA in their tax department. After reading today's article on the ABC stores, I think that from a state budget perspective we should consider abolishing the ABC and allow liquor to be sold in retail stores. I feel that you have an opportunity to this while the issue is in the news. As a second request, is it possible to come up with a law to make it a ticketable offense or fine to carry loose trash in the back of an open pickup truck? I have noticed this blight since moving back to NC. Thank you so much for all that you do as Governor for our state. If you need any help with anything, I hope you will feel free to call on me.

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue My suggestion is that it is past time to eliminate the ABC boards. They are a waste of taxpayer money. No rule changes will insure ethical behavior. They have zero value add for the state and have outlived any purpose they may have once had. You could sell the rights to sell liquor to private businesses, gaining badly needed revenue for the state. You would eliminate the cost of the boards and their excessively rich retirement benefits. You would be providing better service to NC consumers, since private businesses would locate the stores in better locations, have better hours, and would have price competition. There is no reason to keep the ABC boards. Please eliminate them soon, so we can start reaping the benefits. Sincerely, Kathy Pearce, Davidson

	<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/library/images/newsletterHeader.jpg>


Gov. Perdue Announces†2010 Agenda

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Wednesday announced her major policy priorities for the coming year ñ jobs and the economy, education, setting government straight, and keeping communities safe.† Gov. Perdueís goals in each of these areas will help North Carolina emerge from the economic recession stronger than before.† Governor Perdue outlined her initiatives during speeches to the Charlotte Chamber and the Greensboro Partnership this week.
For Gov. Perdue, keeping and growing jobs in North Carolina is her No.1 priority ñ and she recognizes the need for North Carolina to focus its economic development efforts not only on large companies, but also on the small businesses that make up 98% of all state businesses.
During her address, she announced the launch of a statewide small business initiative called Biz Boost.† Biz Boost will help small businesses apply for credit, work on staffing, manage cash, and reduced costs.† It will give small businesses access to the same kind of outside talent that big businesses often use to help them adapt and grow.† The initiative has been successfully piloted already in Charlotte and will be replicated statewide through the Department of Commerce and the NC Small Business and Technology Development Center (SBTDC).
Also, Gov. Perdue announced that during the spring legislative session she will propose tax incentives for small businesses that are born in North Carolina ñ create jobs in North Carolina ñ and stay in North Carolina.
ìWe must grow our own jobs and invest in our own businesses.† We must strengthen the heart and soul of North Carolinaís economy: innovation and small business,î said Gov. Perdue.
In addition to her economic agenda, Gov. Perdue set out her agenda for education and government reform.††
ï Career and College ñ Ready, Set, Go! will refocus our stateís public schools on a single goal: every student, no matter where he or she live in North Carolina, must graduate from high school with what it takes to succeed in a career, in a two- or four-year college or technical training.
ï Setting Government Straight:† Strengthening ethics policies, zero-tolerance for unethical and illegal behavior, eliminating outdated programs and fighting waste, fraud and abuse including cracking down on Medicaid fraud.
ï Keeping Communities Safe:† continue taking steps to reform and strengthen public safety.
ìI pledge to take reform to the next level.† We will set government straight by cracking down on corruption ó strengthening ethics ó and fighting waste, fraud and abuse,î said Perdue.† ìWe will set government straight by tightening our belts and doing more with less ó just like families and businesses are doing all across North Carolina.î
Gov. Perdue Announces New Education Agenda

Gov. Perdue†on Wednesday announced her†new education agenda, Career and College ñ Ready, Set, Go!, in a speech to a Joint Session of North Carolinaís Educational Governing Boards in Kannapolis.† Gov. Perdue outlined a framework to take on the educational challenges facing our state with the goal of preparing every student to be college or career ready after graduating from high school.
ìWe must re-focus our stateís public schools on a single goal.† Every kid ñ no matter where he or she lives in North Carolina ñ must graduate from high school with what it really takes to succeed in a career, in a two- or four-year college or technical training,î said Gov. Perdue.† ìThat means no more losing out on jobs that require more than low skills and no more remedial courses in college.† Graduates will have what it really takes.î
North Carolinaís Educational Governing Boards ñ including the State Board of Education, the UNC Board of Governors, the N.C. State Board of Community Colleges and the N.C. Independent Colleges & Universities Board of Directors ñ are critical partners in Gov. Perdueís plans for education in our state.† They have the ability to set policies that will work together to achieve student readiness.
Gov. Perdueís education agenda will work in three steps:

Ready - Increasing the number of students who can read, write and do math by the end of third grade.

Set - Increasing the number of students that perform at or above grade level.

Go - Increasing the number of students taking college credit courses in high school; graduating from high school; going to college; and completing their degree from a community college, college or university.

Specific policy highlights include:
- Incentives for great teachers in hard to staff schools and content areas
- Leadership Academy for school leaders
- Restructure the ABCís program to include diagnostic assessment, 21st century skills and national assessments so we can see how our students compare to others across the nation and world
- Adopt the Common Core national standards: everyone agrees on the skills that all students need to know to graduate ready to work, go to college or vocational school
- Community College readiness initiative for diagnostic-type assessments to make sure that students graduate with skills necessary to do community college work
State Parks Report Record Attendance in 2009

State parks in North Carolina reported record attendance in 2009 of 14.16 million visits, a jump of 13 percent over the previous year, and up 5 percent from the previous record set in 2007, according to the N.C. Division of Parks and Recreation.
Over the past 25 years, the state parks system has seen a dramatic 238 percent increase in visitation. In 1984, 5.9 million people visited state parks and state recreation areas.
ìItís obvious North Carolinians and visitors to our state recognize the tremendous value our state parks offer in terms of affordable family experiences and respite from a difficult economy,î said Gov. Bev Perdue. ìEvery visitor to the state parks can also take pride in this stateís long history of conservation of its remarkable natural resources.î
The state parks system manages more than 208,000 acres, including 34 state parks and four state recreation areas and a system of state natural areas dedicated to natural resource protection.
Among the parks and recreation areas, 22 reported increases in attendance in 2009. Jockeyís Ridge State Park in Dare County reported the highest attendance at 1.4 million visits, an increase of 2 percent over last year.

Thank the Governor can initiate changes to the ABC system.  Just end it.
 Too much abuse.  I had a friend on the Orange County ABC board . She
got paid for attending mtgs and they got to go to annual conference,
sometimes out of state. . wined and dined.
All my community boards are volunteer.   She kept trying to get me on
as they needed so much help with their personnel issues.   But she soon
realized they didn't want to change.  It is an old boys incestuous
situation and a rip off to tax payer.  I have lived many other places
and no where had this system.

State of North Carolina

Office of the Governor

Friends,

For the past five years, I have had the pleasure of working with Zach
Ambrose in several capacities:  as my Chief of Staff in the Lt.
Governor's office; as my campaign manager in 2008; as the director of my
gubernatorial transition team; and now as my Chief of Staff in the
Governor's office.   He has been an invaluable friend and advisor.  And,
as Chief of Staff, he has been an effective and innovative public
servant of the highest caliber.

But, now, after five strenuous and productive years by my side, Zach
has decided it's time to move on to new endeavors.  He will remain in
his job as Chief-of-Staff for the next several weeks as we work on a
transition to new leadership.

I'm grateful to Zach for all he has done for me and for the people of
North Carolina.   My office will miss his dedication, leadership, and
insightful guidance.  And all of us here in the Governor's office wish
him the very best as he takes on new challenges.  Please join me in
congratulating Zach Ambrose on a job well done.

Comment: Dear Govenor Perdue, we have just moved here in the last 6 months from another state that has normal, modern up todate liquor stores that have beer,wine,liquor and some food items. It was very comveinent. Since living here I have read a lot about the ABC Liquor board and their troubles ,and it is easy to understand why.The door is always open for a hand out. What really caught my attention was a board member just retired and is getting a 100k per year pension. I thought bank employees were bad. WOW!. Just an idea but don't you think if you eliminated the board and opened it to free market that it would create jobs and competition and wipe out goverment corruption at this level? Also the money save in salaries and pensions would probably easily pay for the completion of the I-485 missing loop. Just an idea and I thanks you for listening. Donald Dallman

I believe that ABC Board is a disgrace to North Carolina.† It is the "Good Old
Boys" taking care of themselves with Greed, Greed, Greed.† Their salaries
are outrageous !! This system has to be changed.† You are doing a wonderful
job looking into all these special interests!!
