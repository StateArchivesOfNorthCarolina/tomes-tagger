Subject: Preserve Public Investments and Raise Our Taxes

Comment: Mark Brown 107 Scaleybark Road Charlotte, NC 28209-2608 July 1, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: It's time to come together. I'm asking you, as one of our state's leaders, to come together with your colleagues, and to agree on a budget that helps North Carolinians through this difficult time and sets us up for future prosperity. To do that, we must raise a significant amount of new revenue. Thanks to your leadership and the leadership of your colleagues and predecessors, North Carolina has made wise investments in education, children's healthcare, and family stability. Now is not the time for you to retreat from these investments and others you have championed in the past. We thank you for supporting a balanced approach in your budget by including new revenue that helped to prevent the most devastating of cuts- you are on the right track. However, the outlook for our state's children, families and communities is still grim. That's why I am joining Governor Perdue in asking you now to do more- raise $1.5 billion in new revenue. Doing so will help to preserve the vital investments in education, healthcare, and public safety that make North Carolina such a wonderful place. Thank you. Sincerely, Mark Brown 704-567-8690

Dear Governor Perdue,

I have contacted my state representatives to let them know that I would like
them to pursue any and all creative means for increasing revenue to assist with
budget shortfalls and particular to safeguard the educational system. I would be
happy to assist in any other way that you feel would be useful. Thank you for
your service and please let me know what else I might be able to do to support
you in this difficult time.

Sincerely,
Shanan Fitts

Thank you for your hard work to try and balance the NC budget.

I still am curious what exactly green energy jobs and businesses are.  I am hoping that someone in your office can give an example of a green business or a green energy job.

Thank you.

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.
In that time, our state’s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent — 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolina’s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our state’s budget.
The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolina’s history.
Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolina’s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.
This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our state’s mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.
Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299> 12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.
Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolina’s long-term economic growth.
Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.
As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.
We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.
Public education always has  been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolina’s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.
As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.
I’ve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our children’s education.
The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.

Governor Perdue,

If you look real hard and with an open mind, you will find a number of legacy programs and projects that have either outlived their usefulness or are no longer necessary. What we don't need are increased taxes that will stifle the economy and make the current situation even worse.

Regards,
Ken Ray

Hello,

The NC Council of Churches has suggested that Governor Perdue deserves praise for her courageous stand on increasing revenues for the state, as opposed to simply cutting services.  I absolutely agree with the Council.  It took a lot of courage to propose "revenue increases" (I think we used to call them "tax increases"?)  I voted for Governor Perdue in the November election, but I'd have to say that I'm more impressed with her now than I was at that time!  

Keep up the good work!

Dear Governor Purdue,

Thank you ever so much for holding the line on education.

I reside in wake county, and atop the budget shortfalls, we have the issue of frequent

redistricting. We are own children’s only advocates. I want to applaud you for

drawing the line on my child’s education in the face of critics.



I am frankly tired of co-workers saying to me, ‘Yeah, that’s why I have MY kids in

private school.’   Well, not everyone can afford it, and frankly it’s sad that

people have lost their confidence in the education system of our state to believe

nothing good will come out of it if their children are educated in our public

schools.



This is not an easy job, and you have my respect and support in the future.

Respectfully,

Angel MacKenzie

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our state’s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent — 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolina’s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our state’s budget.

The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolina’s history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolina’s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our state’s mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolina’s long-term economic growth.

Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolina’s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

I’ve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our children’s education.

The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our state’s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent — 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolina’s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our state’s budget.

The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolina’s history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolina’s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

Governor Perdue,
I find your letter unsettling.  As a previous public educator well versed with the failings of our public education system, I find your concern about it's failing laughable.  For years the public education system in North Carolina has been lowering standards to appease people who fear that requiring foremost discipline and secondly hard work somehow puts minorities at a disadvantage.  I left the public education circus, the 12 year babysitting service, to homeschool my children.  If you raise my taxes to support an education system that is failing those unfortunate enough to have to stay in it, you are a fraud.  You will be defrauding poor, ignorant people out of their hard earned money with the promise that you will somehow be saving their children.  Before you throw more money at the public education quagmire, perhaps you should spend a little time taking a logic course.  A course, by the way, that is conspicuously missing from public school classrooms in North Carolina and elsewhere.  How else can such gullible people be trained to believe that our government has their best interest in mind.  Were you more logical and had you the welfare of people, not just the interest of your name, your paychek, or your legacy forefront in your mind, you might be inclined to admit that North Carolina schools are failing and that it is the government's fault.  Only upon admitting there is a problem can you actually begin to do anything about it.  If I thought you would actually take real steps to repair public education in North Carolina, I would happily accept a tax increase.  You may have come from a public education background, but it isn't like it was 40 years ago.  Interview a few newly retired teachers who don't fear losing their jobs anymore.  I bet they would be candid with you about the drugs, disrespect, moral decay, educational malaise, and that's just the parents.  Public education is a war and for too long you and politicians like you have been listening to fools well versed in theory instead of heroes that have been in the trenches.  If you are going to put your hands in our pockets, then please put a hard hat on your head and get ready to get dirty.

Dear Governor Purdue,

Please dont make State Employees carry the brunt of the State's problems.  Everyone should do their part.  Increase sales tax to 9 or 10% so everyone who makes a purchase whether it be food, clothing, computers, etc. will be doing their part.  Even all the folks on welfare will buy these items and do their part too.  Please do not force us out of our jobs!

God Bless,
Beverly Cannon

Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolina’s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

I’ve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our children’s education.

The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.

Come on Bev,

You were put in there to make tough decisons like hundreds of thousands of NC families are forced to do.  Stop the whining and fear tactics and get tough.  You own the State House with Democrats.  Why is this so tough?  Just raise our taxes and be on with it.  Are you afraid of something or what?  Maybe because your taxes are regressive, anti-job and pick on the little guy with fee (aka tax) assessments.  Take a look at the 150,000 plus on the state payrolls.  Any hacks or waste in there?  Want me to go through the list with you (FOIA).  Makes me ill to look at it.

GOVERNMENT DOES NOT MAKE JOBS.  LIKE MOTIVATION, THEY CAN ONLY CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO DO SO.  YOU GET AN F-------- SO FAR.  CUT TAXES IF YOU WANT SUCCESS.  NOBODY, EXCEPT HACKS, TRUSTS YOU.

SORRY FOR THE DIRECTNESS - ONE OF YOUR MANY COMMUNICATION DIRECTORS (HACKS) WILL DELETE THIS ANYWAYS.

Dave Graham
Clayton, NC
Over and Out....

PS:  Happy DEPENDENCE Day, Gov.

Dear Ms. Perdue,

The budget deficit our state is facing is due to prior wasteful spending by our elected officials. Now when North Carolina is in a deep financial crisis Raleigh wants to overburden my family and I with additional taxes. How much more can middle class families like mine absorb. My husband works 3 jobs in order to pay our taxes and our almost $1,000 a month health care insurance. Our home owners insurance has gone up to over $2,000 a year. I love the state of North Carolina but the high cost of living here has us seriously thinking about whether we want to stay. Adding additional taxes to services such as car repairs, haircuts etc may push us over the edge. I have made suggestions to my local school district on ways to cut costs (such as eliminating drivers ed in the schools which would save money on cars, gas, insurance, maintainence, salaries, etc) with no response. I think schools in North Carolina can do more to save tax payers dollars and use the money more effectively.

Sincerely,
Sharon Barrow

How about cutting spending in things other than health care and medicine.   The budget has about doubled in the last 8 years and our population has not.   True transparency would better define core government functions in your letters.  I would also like to know what money was saved by creating a CEO of education-- that sounds at least on the surface as more government-- when we should be cutting administration costs and not adding to it.

Governor:

As an advisor to state and local governments, I appreciate the difficulty of your challenge.  In the face of such fiscal duress, I particularly commend your commitment to governmental programs that are essential to our long-term competitiveness.  However, I fear that half-measures will no longer suffice.  Without a dramatic restructuring of state and local government, and the manner in which they are financed, North Carolina will be unable to meet the challenges ahead.  

Sincerely yours,

Robert Melville

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.
In that time, our stateâ€™s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent â€” 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolinaâ€™s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our stateâ€™s budget.
The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the20largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolinaâ€™s history.
Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolinaâ€™s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.
This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our stateâ€™s mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.
Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.
Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in Mar ch, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolinaâ€™s long-term economic growth.
Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.
As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.
We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.
Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolinaâ€™s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.
As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

Governor Perdue,



It is not debatable that education is of the utmost importance.  Not to be cliché but our children are our future and our state’s greatest resource.  We all must do what we can to ensure that every child in this state has an equal opportunity to reach his or her full potential – not just for the individual child’s benefit but for the benefit every resident and the future of the economy.  Also cliché but true is that every child must be ready to learn.  Until children have basic needs met and access to basic health care, we will never realize the progress that could be made.  Children who are not ready to learn … who are hungry, tired, suffering with constant dental pain, or having difficulty breathing … will not learn until their basic needs are met.  Other students complain and lose interest when the teacher has to repeat information over and over for the students who are “not ready to learn.”  Not ready to learn is quite different from not capable of learning.  We all should be concerned about the child who could become ready to learn.  Our tax dollars for education are not spent wisely if the barriers are not removed that prevent a child from reaching their full academic and life potential.



I am especially concerned at some of the proposed cuts in health care benefits for children.  The cuts affect children who have the biggest needs and whose families have no option but to use the ER for primary care.  The best use of dollars might be to provide first dollar coverage for routine medical care for children, including prescribed medications to prevent needless use of the ER and preventable hospitalizations.  For example, for many children with asthma control and relief medication may cost $200 or more per month – approximately $2400 per year.  A trip to the ER in NC for asthma is estimated at greater than $2200 and a hospital stay for asthma is more than $10,000.  In 2007, the total costs of hospitalizations in NC for asthma was more than $110 million – and most were preventable with proper medical care including medication and education for self-management.  It will not only be a huge disservice to children of this state if cuts are made to NCHC and NC loses the matching federal dollars, but it will be an embarrassment to our state that we would turn money away, especially with the failing economy, at the detriment of our children’s health in order to find dollars to cut from the budget. 



To protect our children’s education, we must first protect their health care …  even if it means raising taxes.  Increased taxes would be much more palatable for us all if we were assured that the children’s health insurance program received EVERY possible matching federal dollar allotted to this state.



Sincerely,



Debbie Harrell

Governor Perdue, I support what you are doing to balance the Budget. I believe the public feels some expenditures are too much and should be reduced to maintain the standards of excellence in programs you advocate. I am surprised at the resistance you have had to small cuts necessary to balance the budget and maintain services. Perhaps an across the board cut in all budgets will better meet all needs.  L.

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our state’s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent — 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolina’s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our state’s budget.

The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolina’s history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolina’s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our state’s mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolina’s long-term economic growth.

Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolina’s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

I wish I had some magic solution for you all to use to fix the problem, but I do not.  The only way I know to help is to try to be deligent in my community, at the local level, to provide input to my local government, when I see issues that concern me.  I do that, but usually, I get a "pat," bureaucratic response in my email, that tells me it is obvious no one is too interested in any input I have to offer.  I had occassion this week, when I saw an obvious food safety issue, and I received a response that just included the respondent "reading me the rules" if you will, when there is an obvious flaw in the rules.  This flaw has the potential to create many more problems down the road.   I do continue to keep all of this in my thoughts and prayers, and try not to get too disheartened about these things.

I do remember the prognosis of the Y2K, at the beginning of the new millenium.  It sounded like doom and gloom, potential power outages, major grid lockdowns, catastrophe everywhere, but when we got to it, there was smooth sailing.

I have heard elderly folks talk to me during my 13 years in this county working with them.  They tell of a time after WWII, when the country was depressed, and jobs were few, and there were many challenges facing the nation, as the GIs returned from the war.  Women who had held positions during the war, were forced out of their jobs, to make room for the returning GIs, even though these women had held their jobs securely and supported the infrastructure of this county during very worldwide troubling times.  In deed, I learned that the county came into tremendous growth, and entered into a new era, with things such as the TVA, and the formation of the electrical gridwork that powers our nation now.  It would be hard to think of us without this thing, that at that time was almost unthinkable.  I myself, although only 56 years old, remember a time in my rural community of Columbus County, that the power lines were strung, and service and the things that follow came into place.

I would hope the bureacratic paradigm way of thinking about everything and the way it affects/effects our systems  and ways of doing government now, much as I alluded to in my opening paragraphs, would not quelch the creativity that leads to the new things that are so good.  It seems to me that government should not be the "be all, end all," but simply a tool, a partner, if you will, to assist us as citizens, and communities, as we grow and keep vitality going. 

I have forwarded your newletter to some of my email friends.  They are very down on things right now.  I told them we must have courage and faith.  Seems like for any creative juices to flow, we all need to get out of this mode of being "down on things."

Thank you,
Kathy Dombroski

PS(regarding my former email to you)
I found the NCLEX website through the help of College Foundation( 2 months of query into the university,community college, ahec, and bon, to no avail).  I have been taking the pretest and scoring very well, considering it has been 13 years, and most all the university/community college/health education systems, except Kaplan, who would be very expensive, seemed to think I was not able to do this.  From my interaction with them all, except Kaplan, it almost seems they are all afraid to interact with someone asking a question.  Is our state higher education system so wrapped in itself, that it can't help  listen and individualize systems to address the needs of state citizens?   That was my impression.

Dear Governor,

In your article, you state twice that our budget situation threatens education, public safety, and healthcare, yet each time you mention saving programs, you only mention education.  I am not opposed to tax increases, but I am opposed to making education the only recipient of salvation.  Treat all programs equally!  As a career state employee, I am tired of this state giving the education branch such favor while the rest of our programs endure sacrifice.  We are all going to have to pay for any tax increase you enact, so why not let all of us feel some short-term benefit through public safety and healthcare spending, not only longer-term benefit through education spending.



Regards,



Sharon Freeman

Governor Perdue,
You are doing a good job. Stay focused on the budget and getting people back to work. I also think the schools should be called into account. There must be some reason that we have dropouts and some students are barely educated when they graduate. NC needs smart and educated people.
I also want to say that Jim Black should server his FULL time in prison. He gave NC a bad name in politics.

Cheryl Luc  a true democrat.

I agree we need to raise money but but taxing the already poor person isnâ€™t the way to go people who make 30,000.00 and less a year are already hurting. Higher gas tax, fun tax,more taxes on food are hurting them even more and keeping them in a lower class. Taxing Social Security would hurt even more I adopted two babies when they were 7day's and 8 months old  they are now 7 years and 8 years old I have become disabled and having a very hard time making ends meet.  I sometimes feel I am drowning and all I hear is raise the taxes on everything we do.  Gas prices are higher utilities bills are higher food bills are higher we have no money left for the fun things.  I do not get food stamps,my boys do get health choice but it won't even cover the hospital bill when I had to take my son in for an emergency so now I have to figure out how to pay a $500.00 medical bill.  Leave the poor person alone. Tax the ones that make the money and are living a better life.

Budget is good, but when we make cuts we should cut the fat out first.  As in cutting meat, you start by trimming the fat and gristle and some bone , you dont go straight into the meat and start cutting.

> As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

> I’ve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our children’s education.

> The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.

I support targeted tax increases to protect vital education and health services in North Carolina. Yes to wine, beer, cigarette, liquor tax increases. Yes to closing corporate tax loopholes.

Governor Perdue,



In the midst of this budget crisis, I received an e-mail from the office of my state representative, The Hon. Jamie Boles, telling me that NCDOT plans to spend millions of dollars widening NC 24/27 between Robbins and the Moore/Montgomery County line.



SPENDING MILLIONS TO WIDEN ROADS, WHEN OUR SCHOOLS ARE LAYING OFF TEACHERS IS AN OUTRAGE. By following such priorities what kind of example do we set?



PLEASE do whatever you can to take the money from wasteful and environmentally harmful road projects and put these funds toward the budget shortfall in education.



Respectfully,



Marsh Smith

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our state’s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent — 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolina’s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our state’s budget.

The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolina’s history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolina’s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our state’s mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolina’s long-term economic growth.

Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolina’s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

I’ve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our children’s education.

The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.



          Sincerely,


            Bev Perdue

GOVERNOR PERDUE,

I KNOW YOU HAVE DONE A LOT TOWARD BALANCING THE BUDGET, BUT RAISING TAXES ON THE RESIDENTS OF NORTH CAROLINA DRIVES MANY OUT OF THE STATE.  IN ADDITION, RAISING TAXES ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES WILL IMPACT THE CREATION OF JOBS IN NORTH CAROLINA.

I KNOW YOU ARE UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE TO SATISFY SEGMENTS OF YOUR CONSITUENCY, BUT RAISING TAXES AND HURTING SMALL BUSINESSES HURTS NORTH CAROLINA.

BE COURAGEOUS.  CUT ANY PROGRAMS THAT WERE INSTITUTED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT CAUSED US TO BE OVER OUR BUDGET.  IT WILL BE PAINFUL FOR SOME OF YOUR CONSITUENTS, BUT IN THE LONG RUN IT WILL BE BETTER FOR NORTH CAROLINA TO PAY ONLY FOR PROGRAMS THAT THEY CAN AFFORD.

SINCERELY,

ROBERT A. HAHN

Governor Perdue,

Thank you for serving as our Governor in difficult economic  times.

The most important thing that can help our economy is to provide jobs and get people back to work, therefore bringing in more state revenue. 

In order to accomplish this mission, we must NOT INCREASE TAXES at this time.  Tax INCREASES will lengthen the economy  downturn and cause a loss of more jobs.
I am a registered voter who votes.

Thank you for your consideration.

Hal Culberson

> State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.
In that time, our stateâ€™s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent â€” 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolinaâ€™s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our stateâ€™s budget.
The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolinaâ€™s history.
Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolinaâ€™s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.
This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our stateâ€™s mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.
Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.
Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolinaâ€™s long-term economic growth.
Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.
As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.
We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.
Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolinaâ€™s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.
As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.
Iâ€™ve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our childrenâ€™s education.
The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.

 It can not be all about the classroom and get the wide support it needs. As important as that is public safety and health care must be included. They are talked about but never is there a statement that any of the tax money will go to either. As I roam around the state I hear strong criticism for raising taxes in general but more specifically putting it all in the schools. You probably know, but I have been shocked by the number of people who  think education is getting more than their share of the budget. I stopped by a local restaurant/bar where a lot of business people and professionals gather on Wednesday nights after work and  the hot topic was that the county school system is cutting teachers and teacher's aides but not any administrators such as assistant superintendants. Thhe teacher's there were not happy campers. I don't envy your problem but want to let you know what I hear.

Gov. Perdue,

I applaud your efforts to retain a quality of education for N.C., also public safety and mental health services for families because these protect our future. I support any budget changes that are necessary in these areas.  I would like to discuss another matter that  I have a very strong opinion.  The coastal insurance support that is being discussed to enable property holders and insurance companies in beach areas is not fair... This does not seem like an equitable responsibility for citizens to aid those who choose to build in areas that are constantly changing because of nature and natural disasters.  If I decided to live in those areas I should not expect the citizens of N.C. to pay for insurance to replace my property.  I realize that tourism in the coastal areas is great but home owners and realty owners should be responsible for these ventures if they chose to live or have businesses there. Increases in Disaster Insurance should be the responsibility of the owners, and the insurance companies should be accountable to cover or deny coverage that  they can't afford or cover.. I realize that the increase in insurance cost may be difficult but don't make the citizens pay  in this matter. Please keep the citizens of N.C. informed on this issue.
Sincerely,
Pat Blackwell

 Good Afternoon Gov. Perdue,
 I sincerely hope this email will reach you personnally..
Supportative members in our community such as Dr. David Tayloe, President of the American Academy of Pediatrics and a local pediatrician, Shirley Sims, Wayne County Board of Education member and myself have tried to arrange a meeting with you to express our support of the school-based health programs in our county and all over our state. Unfortunately, we have been unable to reach you, instead directed to see Dr. Bill Harrison. We met with him on May 8th, and hopefully we were able to inform him about school-based health care.
 I know that our State is under great stress for funds and I appreciate all of those in our government trying to balance a difficult budget. My fear is those balancing this budget are not all informed on school-based health care and do not see the total picture when decisions are made to cut needed programs that provide preventive and medical health care. As you know by having visited two of our school based health centers in Wayne County, our centers are providing health care that many children would not have access to if there were not school-based centers. School-Based Health Centers across this great state are providing many needed services that are keeping our children healthy, in school and off the streets. Our emergency rooms are not packed with adolescents so they are better able to provide the services that are truly emergent. Our programs save our counties and state money, and take care of those who otherwise would require health/mental and social services. Please, as an informed representative do not allow cuts for the school-based health programs. We have been limited in funding and have not had an increase in the state budget since 2000. Last year's budget was 1.4 million for school-based health programs, there are 53 centers across our state and 28 of those are credentialed by the state in providing quality comprehensive health care. 
 Gov. Perdue, I am asking that you please inform your colleagues and support our school-based health programs. We work hard to take care and meet the needs of the children we serve. I am not asking for an increase but that you do not decrease our state funding.
 I have many wonderful case studies that show we are making a difference in caring for our adolescents. Please support the School-Based Health Center Programs here in North Carolina.
With my best regards and support,
Phyllis

Dear Sir or Madame:

	I agree with the Governor's positions and support her efforts to improve our economy and protect education.

	However, I must say that I certainly hope that all these efforts give FIRST priority to American/North Carolina CITIZENS.  Why should tax dollars go to increasing the educational and job opportunities for illegal immigrants?

	This on-going waste and misappropriation of tax dollars manifests itself in every facet of our economy and public agencies.  Citizens are laid-off from the few factories that are open and are replaced with illegal aliens (who, by the way, are sometimes given legal citizens' SSN to get in the "system").  Schools are overburdened with the expenses of ESL, additional "freebies," etc.  Social Services, jails and our courts are clogged with  undocumented immigrants. 

	And now lobbyists are whining that our community colleges should lift the moratorium on admitting illegal aliens, again, at tax-payer expense.  The proposal to charge them "out of state" (correction -- out of country) tuition is laughable, as the complaint that they are becoming "second class citizens" without access to higher education.  CITIZENS??  Maybe it would put to rest once and for all the inane excuse that "illegal aliens do the work that Americans won't,"  because if they get a 2-year degree, they ain't gonna do that anymore.

	This is NOT an issue of morality, compassion, tolerance, etc.  I wish no ill will toward immigrants personally, and I do not blame them for trying to better their lives.  However, this is matter of LAW, representation of CITIZENS (for a change), and the stewardship of tax payers' money.  

	For decades now, we have had to helplessly watch as our state and federal government and businesses shamelessly encourage and subsidize employment, educational, housing and welfare opportunities for illegal aliens who have absolutely no accountability or obligations.  

	So if we're having to pinch pennies and suffer, how about doing so with the  right , LEGAL priorities ?

	Thank-you.

State of the Budget


For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our state's unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent - 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolina's families have been hurt by the recession, so has our state's budget. 

The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolina's history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolina's government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our state's mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

Through my JobsNOW <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>  initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my 12 in 6 program <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299> , a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolina's long-term economic growth.

Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolina's economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

I've traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our children's education.

The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.

Thank you for your reply and for your devotion to good teachers !  I am proud to be teaching in a state with a governor who is so attuned to our childrens' best interests and highest quality education.

>>> Office of the Governor <governor.office@nc.gov> 06/17/09 1:16 PM >>>
Dear Mrs. Pepe:

Thank you for your recent letter about the value of National Board Certification for our teachers. Thanks to years of strong leadership, our state has been the national leader each year in the number and percentage of National Board Certified Teachers (NBCTs) in our schools. Last year alone, North Carolina's number of NBCTs increased by over 1,400 teachers and we passed the 10% mark for teachers holding certification!

Research continues to show the connection to positive student achievement and National Board Certification. Please know that Governor Perdue will continue her commitment to providing the best and the brightest teachers for all our students.

You will be happy to know that Governor Perdue's proposed budget does not include elimination of NBCT funding.  You can track the progress of the State's budget via the North Carolina General Assembly's website:  www.ncleg.net<http://www.ncleg.net/>. Please continue advocating for quality teachers in our state.

Thank you for all you do for the children of North Carolina.

Office of Governor Bev Perdue

As our governor and a former educator yourself, I know you are dedicated to the best quality education possible for all NC children. This standard of excellence can continue to be upheld with the addition of more NBCT's in years to come. Please continue to include us in the state budget!

Dear Ms Perdue:



Your statement is copied below.

“We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.”

I agree that we need to protect CORE EDUCATION (no free lunches or breakfasts – these are just giveaways not education) and PUBLIC SAFETY (try putting the criminals in prison not on probation –raise the penalties don’t lower them).

I VEHEMENTLY DISAGREE  that health care needs to be protected.

Health care is not something to be given away or paid for by our tax dollars. Our ancestors worked for everything the got while building this country. Health care is not an inalienable right it is something to be worked for. If you tell someone that you will give them (i.e. food stamps, Medicare and Medicaid because they are not working – They will never have an incentive to work.) (i.e. Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) because they are having babies – They will never have an incentive to work or marry because it would reduce their aid payout ). All of these programs have some good benefit in a short term situation, but are inherently evil because they breed dependence and rob the recipients of ambition.

I pay taxes for TRANSPORTATION(ROADS), EDUCATION, and PUBLIC SAFETY NOT social giveaway programs. Go through the budget line by line and get rid of the giveaways.

	Govenrnor Perdue,
Now is the time to stop being penny-wise and pound-foolish. What do I mean?
This state is looking at raising the "BEER TAX." How penny-looking can we be! The real problem is that for years North Carolina has avoided the most important tax it can use in favor of puny hits on the citizenry. I MEAN PROPERTY TAX.
When our family moved from Iowa to North Carolina we discovered we could own much more house and pay much LESS tax. Warren Buffet no less said the same thing about California and look at that dilemma. Do you not think those New Yorkers will stop coming? Or those Connecticut refugees might choose ... South Carolina, Georgia. Our state can't stop the influx of these Northerners.
It is time for North Carolinians to come into reality. We North Carolinians need services that our state government is responsible to provide to the entire citizenry. I love great roads, I depend on law enforcement and other public safety elements, our schools have looked to the lottery for help, and I am hugely disappointed in all but one of my county's schools. You should hear the boo hoos about the suggestion of raising property taxes. It's a gimme gimme but ... the nerve to raise my property taxes.
So Ms. Perdue, you can be stalwart and kindly and good hearted and concerned but don't forget to be prudent and 21st century and realistic. Real leaders don't shy-away form serious answers. Property tax is for the investors in North Carolina to say thank you for this beautiful state and yes, I do want to keep its best interest at heart. Come-on Bev, you won the governorship, go for the gold not the bronze: raise property taxes.
With every good wish for a fabulous North Carolina,
Mitch Siegel

Increased Opportunity for Historically Underutilized Businesses

The Office for Historically Underutilized Businesses (HUB) launched its new Statewide Uniform Certification (SWUC) program on Wednesday.  SWUC was developed to streamline the certification process, reduce the redundancy in certifying minority and women-owned businesses and create a centralized HUB and minority/women business database.  The HUB Office will take the lead in certifying HUB and Minority/Women Business Enterprise (M/WBE) firms that previously had to apply for certification both through the state HUB Office and local M/WBE program offices.
“This initiative will expand opportunities for minority-, disabled- and women-owned businesses to participate in state and local government contracts,” said Gov. Bev Perdue, who recently issued Executive Order No. 13 to assist HUB firms. “We trust it will help the state achieve, and hopefully exceed, its aspirational goal of at least 10 percent of all state government contracts being awarded to HUB firms.”
SWUC is the result of N.C. General Statute 143-128.4, 143-48.4.  It was developed by the HUB Office in collaboration with local M/WBE program directors and with feedback from HUB firms, prime contractors and HUB resource advocates.  In addition to increasing efficiency and service to the HUB community, SWUC will establish a centralized database for state agencies, local municipalities and contractors looking to identify and utilize HUB vendors and sub-contractors.
Buncombe County Manufacturer to Add 32 Jobs

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that Baldor Electric Co., an international supplier of industrial electric motors, mechanical power transmission products, drives and generators, will expand its Weaverville operations.  The company plans to invest more than $4.8 million and create 32 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $64,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
“North Carolina remains attractive to thriving companies like this one,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Our top-ranked business climate and knowledge-based workforce help keep our manufacturing sector strong and diverse, providing the good jobs our citizens have come to expect.”
Baldor Electric Co., headquartered in Arkansas, operates 26 manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Canada, England, Mexico and China, and provides products to more than 70 countries. Three of the company’s plants are in North Carolina, employing a combined workforce of nearly 700 people.
Baldor is consolidating its Sleevoil hydrodynamic bearing line in Indiana and moving those operations to its Weaverville plant, which currently employs 128 workers.  The 32 new jobs added over the next three years will pay an average wage of $42,209, not including benefits, which is higher than the Buncombe County average of $32,968.
This project follows two other recent One NC Fund announcements for Baldor facilities in Western North Carolina.  In June, Gov. Perdue announced 114 new jobs and an investment of $12.2 million in Cleveland County.  In May, the governor announced 25 new jobs and an investment of $3.1 million in McDowell County.

"Booze It & Lose It: Operation Firecracker"

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that state and local law enforcement officers will be out in full force over the Fourth of July holiday as part of the “Booze It & Lose It: Operation Firecracker” campaign. Checkpoints and stepped-up patrols will be conducted Monday, June 29, through Sunday, July 5, across the state in an effort to remove impaired drivers from the roads.
“Too many people fail to understand that alcohol and driving don’t mix. Impaired driving is no accident, nor is it a victimless crime,” Perdue said. “Law enforcement officers will crack down on impaired drivers, ensuring that everyone is celebrating the holiday responsibly.”
There were 377 alcohol-related crashes, 322 with injuries and 12 that resulted in fatalities, over the Independence Day week last year.
Officers charged more than 1,900 North Carolina motorists with driving while impaired during the 2008 “Booze It & Lose It: Operation Firecracker” campaign. More than 5,700 stepped-up patrols and checkpoints were held.

Subject: THANK YOU for supporting the Advertising-Nexus Tax Law!

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: I'm writing to thank you for your kind and generous assistance to my California-based online publishing business. By supporting the Advertising-Nexus tax law in your state, you are forcing hundreds of out-of-state merchants to terminate their paid advertising relationships with thousands of web publishers (small businesses) in your state. This creates a wonderful opportunity for me to earn more advertising revenue while helping those merchants continue to sell products to residents of all 50 states, including yours. I really appreciate your efforts, especially since the law will bring in only a nominal amount of new sales-tax revenue, while reducing your state's income tax revenue by a larger amount. Thank you for subsidizing my business at the expense of your state's residents and small business owners. I'm glad that California's families will benefit from the additional income taxes I pay.

Subject: New Revenues Must be Part of the Budget Solution

Comment: Phyllis A. Hoover 130 Lovelace Rd. Forest City, NC 28043-5765 July 3, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: It's time to come together. I'm asking you, as one of our state's leaders, to come together with your colleagues, and to agree on a budget that helps North Carolinians through this difficult time and sets us up for future prosperity. To do that, we must raise a significant amount of new revenue. Thanks to your leadership and the leadership of your colleagues and predecessors, North Carolina has made wise investments in education, children's healthcare, and family stability. Now is not the time for you to retreat from these investments and others you have championed in the past. We thank you for supporting a balanced approach in your first budget by including new revenue that helped to prevent the most devastating of cuts- you are on the right track. However, the outlook for our state's children, families and communities is still grim. That's why I am asking you to work with your colleagues to put in place a budget that raises revenue in a fair and smart way. Doing so will help to preserve the vital investments in education, healthcare, and public safety that make North Carolina such a wonderful place. Thank you. P.S It would be prudent for Our legistors, Not recieve pay raises. They are not any of the rest of us who have to make do with what we have. Sincerely, Phyllis A. Hoover 828-980-3658
