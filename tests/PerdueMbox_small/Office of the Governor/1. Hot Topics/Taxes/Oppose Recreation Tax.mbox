Thanks for taking the time to read my email.



I wanted to take a minute express my concerns about taxing services. I am a hairdresser, who owns a salon. Because I sell retail I am familiar w/ charging sales tax on the products I sell, but for my independent contractors who rent their space, it would be inconvenient and a burden. I canít imagine the added time to their day (or mine, for that matter) just to figure out the tax on their services and the time to deal w/ coin change. The contractors in our salon do not accept credit cards, so their payments are limited to checks and cash, which once again, a non-profitable use of time. I do not have a computer in the salon; therefore, all the calculating is done by hand. I canít imagine for salons and other service related businesses that have computers, what kind of cost will incur to update their systems. My other question is, will this tax be considered income and then a deduction as an expense? Where would the benefit be for the state? Would this be another form to fill out quarterly?



I also want to comment on the general sales tax. I may have misunderstood, but from what I heard this am, there is consideration to raise the sales tax temporarily. I say, raise it and leave it! The general consensus of my clientele is that they (we) would just rather have a one time increase and leave it alone. Itís like the postal service raising the cost on stamps, instead of small increases, make one increase and stick w/ it! I am sure there will be those oppose any increase, let alone, 1%, but Iíd rather pay 8% tax on sale products and keep our schools staffed!! If approached that itís only $8.00 on $100.00 up from $7.00 on the $100.00, maybe it will more understood. Plus, Iíd rather see a higher sales tax on products than taking the education lottery money away from what it was planned for-Education!



Finally, I want to bring up my previous email promoting toll roads in NC.(if the email found the ìtrash binî I would be more than happy to resend). I have shared this w/ many of my clients and friends, and they all agree that it would be a great idea. If our clientele represents a portion of the NC residents, maybe this is a project that would be supported. I would be glad to get involved in promoting and rallying for support for this project if it would help.



I (and many, many others) really want to see our wonderful state rally and make it out of this tough time. Please listen to your residents!! Lets make NC a state to be admired by our fellow states.



Have a great day!

Laura Horton

Comment: I am opposed to the recreation tax that you are considering behind closed doors. I believe that camp is as much a part of my children's education as the education itself. Also, I think that you would damage the tourist business in north carolina if you continue to tax us. I think a better option might be to cut jobs, salaries, expensive meetings and travels, services, and work from whatever budget you have. Government should be run like other businesses have to run their business - if you can't afford it, you don't buy it.

Subject: Proposed Recreation tax

Comment: I have heard from my children's summer camps that camp tuition may be included in the proposed recreation tax. I would like to say that I am vehemently against this for several reasons.first of all we see camp as an important educational life experience for our children rather than a recreational outing. Secondly, we as a family already make financial sacrafices to send our three children to summer camp because we feel it is that valuable an experience. If this proposed tax goes through, it will further stress our finances and put our children's camp experience in jeopardy. I also believe that this tax would have a huge negative impact on children who attend camps on scholarship throughout the state. Camps provide a forum for valuable life lessons for children as well as a much needed break from overuse of electronic technologies such as television, video games, cell phones,etc... Please reconsider your position on this tax for the sake of so many children of our state. Thank you for your consideration, Mimi Anderson

Dear Governor Perdue:



I am writing to ask you to oppose the inclusion of summer camps in the proposed recreation tax being discussed in committee. As a parent, camp has been an important part of my childrenís education, and as a result, our family has given up other ìluxuriesî like vacations or new cars so that our children can have this opportunity. Camp is not an attraction, and the inclusion of this tax may price us out of the opportunity and jeopardize the existence of many camps in North Carolina. I am certain that this is neither the committeeís nor your intention. Summer camp tuition is more similar to school tuition, not a day pass at the Biltmore House or Carowinds. Please remove summer camps from the proposed recreation tax. Thank you for your consideration.



Sincerely,



Louise Rollins

Subject: Services and Recreation Tax

Comment: It is becoming harder and harder to live in this beautiful state. My wife and I retired here from the Washington D.C. area about 4 years ago and we have seen a steady erosion of our retirement assets. Insurance rates have skyrocketed (40% this year alone), the gas tax, sales tax, the list is long and painful. How do you expect retirees on fixed income to survive in this state? Now, I understand that there is a proposal to tax golf memberships and other recreational activities. Where does it stop? I also understand that N.C. would tax services for the first time. My wife has a small business on Oak Island where she provides massage, facials and other spa-type services. She keeps what she charges to a minimum and we only have a very small profit margin as it is. This tax, would in effect, "kill her business". I never thought I would consider leaving this beautiful area, but I do not see anything North Carolina is doing to try to keep me here. I expect you to drop these recreation and services tax proposals. Stop this madness. Sincerely, Randy Lewis 3820 Ridge Crest Drive Southport, N.C

Subject: Myths About Retailers & Sales Tax Relating to SB202 - 27c.2

Comment: There are many myths and misunderstandings being circulated regarding the ‚Äúaffiliate nexus‚Äù legislation. Please takes my points into consideration and vote AGAINST this new tax collection for out-of-state-retailers who advertise on N.C. web publishers‚Äô sites. MYTH #1: NC ‚ÄúBRICK AND MORTAR‚Äù STORES COLLECT THE TAX, SO ITS ONLY FAIR OUT-OF-STATE RETAILERS SHOULD, TOO ‚Ä¢ In-state stores benefit from tax-based services, such as police and fire protection. ‚Ä¢ Out-of-state retailers do not necessarily receive these same services. ‚Ä¢ Among the constitutional case law tests that must be satisfied in order for states to ‚Äúhave the right to lay a tax on interstate commerce‚Äù is that the tax must be ‚Äúfairly related to the services provided by the state.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Companies with ‚Äúbrick and mortar‚Äù stores in our state factor in the cost of administering that tax when setting up their business. ‚Ä¢ In-state businesses who do not have a ‚Äúphysical presence‚Äù in other states are only required to administer the tax in a single state. MYTH #2: ONLINE RETAILERS DON‚ÄôT LIKE THE TAX BECAUSE IT MAKES THEM LESS COMPETITIVE WITH N.C. STORES ‚Ä¢ If more states adopt this practice before the ‚Äúaffiliate nexus‚Äù issue is finally declared unconstitutional by the courts, administering this tax will place an unreasonable burden on out-of-state retailers to administer sales tax for MULTIPLE STATES and local municipalities. ‚Ä¢ Amazon‚Äôs decision to drop its relationships with web publishers in states close to passing similar laws was more likely based on learning in N.Y. just how burdensome the process is rather than how competitive it would be in a particular state. MYTH #3: LARGE OUT-OF-STATE RETAILERS WILL PAY THE TAX RATHER THAN LOSE N.C. CUSTOMERS ‚Ä¢ Retailers discontinuing their relationship with N.C. web publishers does not to translate to them refusing to sell products to N.C. residents. ‚Ä¢ They will still sell to N.C. residents. ‚Ä¢ They will no longer sponsor advertising on sites managed by N.C. web publishers resulting in fewer out-of-state dollars coming into North Carolina. MYTH #4: ENFORCING THIS TAX ON OUT-OF-STATE RETAILERS WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FOR THE STATE. ‚Ä¢ Large online retailers whose only connection to N.C. is sponsoring ads on N.C. publishers‚Äô web sites are simply discontinuing that advertising rather than being faced with taking on the burden of collecting this tax. ‚Ä¢ Since these retailers will not be collecting the tax, the state will only be able to collect sales tax by requiring N.C. residents to declare tax owed from out-of-state purchases on their state income tax returns - the same way it is being done now.

Subject: HELP! Evidence of Sabotage of Summer Work Program

Comment: This is a follow-up to my URGENT email last night warning Rahm Emanuel, you and others that the summer work program in NC is being SABOTAGED. NC State University is involved in the mix somehow. I am told that they received an ARRA grant for a program named RISE that somehow preempts existing WIA contractors. I am inserting the text of an email received today that may clarify this point. It is a total and complete disgrace and evidences a complete disregard for the economically disadvantaged families in these five North Carolina counties who so desperately need these summer jobs. "Hello Staff, We had asked that you hold off on making referrals to contract agencies until RISE (a Co-Operative extension program via NC. State) sent a list back of those they had decided not to work with for the summer. We still have not received a list, and NC. State has not reported on the background checks. Time continues to pass, and we cannot keep waiting. We want to send referrals so youth can go to work. Please refer cases and send any referral packages of certified clients to the appropriate contract agencies as follows: Edgecombe County/ Nash County residents Send packages to Rocky Mount O.I.C. c/o Mr. Charles Washington 402 E. Virginia Street P. O. Box 2723 Rocky Mount, N.C. 27801 Refer cases on line to Charles Washington Halifax County/ Northampton County residents Send packages to CADA (Choanoke Area Development Association) c/o Ms. Angela Mitchell (P.

I absolutely OPPOSE a recreational tax in NC. Rather than raise taxes ñ CUT SPENDING!!!!!†

If I canít meet my budget at home, I donít have the pleasure of raising taxes, (or better yet, voting to lower my taxes to increase disposable spending)

I have to CUT BACK!



Why is NC above the normal economic law. If thereís not enough, cut back!



I do not support a recreational tax, instead, support a decrease in NC government spending!
