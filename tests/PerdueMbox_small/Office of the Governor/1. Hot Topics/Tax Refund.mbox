Comment: I believe one of the best ways to stimulate our NC economy is for the state to send out the tax refund checks. I should have already had mine - that would surely help me and help the state.

Comment: I am so disappointed in how the NC dept of revenue is holding it's taxpayer's money hostage. It's been 4 weeks since I filed my return electronically and I still don't have my refund. I can't pay my mortgage or my electric bill. I don't care what your cash flow problem is, mine is alot worse! I will now make sure that in 2009 I withhold enough cash back from my state tax so that I don't have to go through this next year. You can bet you will not have interest free money to hold onto from me in the future. You should be ashamed of yourself! Glad I didn't vote for you!

Subject: Where do I bill NC for interest and penalties for not refunding my tax over payment

Comment: Since the state of NC has failed to refund my tax over payments from 2008 within a timely fashion (now over 6 weeks) I wanted to inquire to the chief incompentence running this state as to whom I may direct a bill noting penalties and interest on the $1960 due me by the State of NC. I find it ironic that you democrats who can not manage our government and over spent revenues cant seem to find the money to pay those hard working citizens back the over payments collected by this "fine" state. Maybe your proposed $1 per pack of cigarette tax will be used to help repay the citizens the money that the state has stolen from them so that your rediculous entitlement programs and wasteful spending can continue. I find it disgusting that you are looking for ways to further tax people in this economic time period when the rest of us who actually work are trimming the fat out of our budgets to survive. Here is a novel concept...if you dont have the money for it, dont buy it! Wow! What a day it would be if you and the rest of your democrat friends would actually say "Gee, we dont have enough money to spend so we need to tighten things up." Personally, you and the rest of the politicians in Raleigh disgust me and there is a special place in hell for all of you. In the mean time, please let me know where I can send a bill to the state as I intend on collecting interest on the money you are illegally with holding from me. Fair is fair, if you can charge me a penalty for not paying on time, the state should do the same. Here is a novel idea...why not suspend payments to you rediculous polticians until the rest of us get our money back? Hummm How many more years till an election? What a day when we get the sleaz out of the governors mansion and out of Raleigh!

Dear Governor,

We have always paid our taxes on time.  We have filed our taxes early in the season.  I was told by the Dept. of Revenue that our tax return had been processed and was approved.  She said you are asking people to be patient on refunds.  If we were unable to pay OUR taxes on time, the State of NC would not only charge us penalties, but interest as well, and would not be patient in waiting for us to pay.  We have bills that need to be paid!  I ask that you expedite the payment of our refund.  We thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Daniel Britt and Susan Prangley Kimel

I can appreciate the fact that the state is facing a deficit (has been for years due to poor management) but I am facing my own personal deficit that is the direct result of poor management impacting the economy!

Comment: I am currently due a $701.00 tax refund. I filed my tax return with the State of NC at least a month ago. Frankly, though, I don't really care if I receive that refund or not, as long as it is put to good use (feed a couple of hungry families, pay a months rent for a family, help pay someone's medical bill, or any other similar use) by the State of NC.

I called the NC Revenue service today to inquire about our refund status and was told our tax return was received on Feb. 15 (I sent the taxes by mail in a postal blue box on Jan. 27) and they started processing our return on Feb.27th. 4 whole weeks after it was sent. I find this odd that this is the first year in the 26 years my husband have filed our returns and not received our check in less than 4 weeks. We all know what you are doing with our money and its not fair. We have bills to pay to. I have always paid my taxes on time and feel you owe it to my family to send the money that belongs to us. We are struggling!!!!!!!! I'm not asking for a hand out only what belongs to me.

Comment: I would like to know why it is taking so long to process NC tax refunds. I hve received my federal refund and I know they process more paperwork the NCDOR. I cetainly hope the finds are not being held. This is our money tht has been involuntarily taken from my paycheck every pay period. If I over paid my state taxes you need to return the difference. If I owed taxes I don't think you would settle for receiving it when I "get around to it! It has been over six weeks and we have been offered no explanation for the delay. Only an automated message tht states "in process". In process HOW LONG? People need there money now more than ever. Disgusted with NC government

Comment: Hello Governor Perdue, I'm sure these questions are screened but I still wanted to address this letter to you. I had filed my taxes on Feb 16 2008. Today is March 23 2008. I check Dornc.com to find out where my refund is every day. It still says it has been received and is in process. I have called the Dpt of Revenue as well who can only acknowledge the same thing and that the refunds this year need a little more time. How much time do you need to give me my money back. I was laid off in October, both my kids are on medicade and wic. I really need this money and was wondering when I could expect it. I do apologize for the simple format and the straight forwardness of this email. I realize this may not be the most professional letter you have received but I'm just frustrated and really don't feel like making it as professional has it should. Thank You.

A total of 20,183 traffic and criminal citations were issued statewide. During the Governor‚Äôs Highway Safety Program campaign, officers statewide conducted 2,535 sobriety checkpoints and dedicated patrols.

Officers also issued 1,832 safety belt and 194 child passenger safety violations, 6,224 speeding violations and 489 drug charges.

Subject: Tax Refunds EXTREMELY DELAYED!

Comment: My biggest question is WHY are tax refunds almost TWO MONTHS behind! I paid my taxes on time, and the state held my money for a year, and now it is time to pay me back, and here I sit! It has never taken this long to get a refund. This delay is unacceptable! Look.......the least you can do is put a post on the NC Dept. of Revenues' website alerting citizens that there are delays for whatever reason. It is bad enough having extreme delays due to governmental problems, but even worse when you will not inform your citizens of such delays. Stop keeping taxpayers in the dark, and let us know what is truly going on, and why our refunds are tied up. We deserve to know the truth, and in these tough economic times, we deserve to have our overpaid taxes refunded to us in a reasonable amount of time. Thanks for listening, and feel free to contact me at any time. Captain Steve Hall Piedmont Airlines (252) 259-5294

Subject: State Tax Refunds

Comment: I would like to know where our state stands on state tax refunds? I filed electronic over 4 weeks ago and when I check the site it has continued to say they have been received and are in process. How long exactly does the processing take? Does NC not have the funds to issue state tax refund checks? If not, why have we not been notified? I do not like being lied to or have information kept from me. I work and pay my taxes. NC tax is taken out of every check like clockwork but when it's time to get my refund I am having to wait longer than told and it costs extra to file electronic so what was the point? So yes, I have a suggestion. Notify the people verbally if it is taking longer. We can appreciate it if you are honest with us even though we may not like it. If you are going by the last 2 digits of social security numbers like the stimulus checks last year of whatever, just let us know. I know alot of people like myself who are awaiting these refunds in this suffering economy and just making us wait without justifiable notication is just the same ole politics.

Subject: Tax Refund

Comment: There are people out here waiting on there tax refund to pay bills. Just like North Carolina needs to pay it's bills. But the state seems to be holding on to this money it owes it citizens to pay other bills. I think the bill North Carolina should pay is the money it owes it's citizens so they can continue to survive in this economy. People are going to learn from this and adjust their withholding so you will see less tax income over the course of the year. And when they owe the state at the end of the year I don't think North Carolina will be as patient then as we are expected to be now. You aren't making any friends right now so don't get too comfortable in your new seat. Thanks

However, it is almost April and I really would like to have my tax refund. If I owed the state, you would still expect my check on the 15th of April even if I too had financial problems.

Subject: State Income Tax Refund

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing to you about a very serious concern that I have regarding the length of time it is taking me to receive my 2008 North Carolina Tax Refund. As you know, these are trying economic times for North Carolina and citizens do not understand why the have to wait 9-12 weeks to get a refund which they are due because the state is either inefficient or is broke and can't pay its bills. Citizens are required to pay taxes in a timely manner and with interest if they are late. My return is dragging into its ninth week with no end in sight and I am not being paid interest for the delays because the State of North Carolina is either incompetent or is insolvent. If this is the case, your office should be upfront with North Carolina taxpayers and tell them why they are being held hostage due to politics as usual in Raleigh or the incompetence of the North Carolina Department of Revenue. I intend to contact my local newspaper and have them do a story on this tax debacle and maybe then some information will get down to the electorate. I would appreciate a reply and not some hand to another bureaucrat. Thank you for your consideration.

Comment: I understand that you have decided to with hold sending out the state tax refund checks from the people that it rightfully belongs to for up to six months or more because of the state's enormous debt. The people are just as strapped for cash right now to pay their own bills and in some cases to keep food on their tables for their families. You should turn over the people's money to the people. This state is in the worst shape it's ever been in because of the policies of Easley...and seems like we're headed down the same wrong path with you...

Subject: State Income Tax Refunds

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: Why have you not come out publicly and leveled with the citizens and taxpayers of North Carolina and let them know that the State is insolvent and can't pay its bills? There is no excuse for the State not to be paying its bills unless it is insolvent. Delaying payments without proper payment of interest is against the law and the double talk and lies coming out of the General Assembly and the NC Department of Revenue and Mr. Lay is deplorable. State officials are more interested in triple A bond ratings than taking care of the business of the average North Carolina citizen and taxpayer. The Governor and the General Assembly as a whole are responsible for a lot of the current economic mess this state is in but you insist on budgeting with "voodoo economics" by counting on money that you do not have in the Treasury. Household budgets do not work that way. We can only spend what we have or earn. Governor, you need to address the people of North Carolina and admit that the State Treasury is insolvent and that the state can't pay its bills and not all of the crap about delays within the NC Department of Revenue because it does not have the cash flow to pay its bills on time. The NC Department of Revenue is in a state of default. Governor Perdue, you need to address this issue and I expect a prompt reply. State newspapers need to do an expose on state government and expose all of the lies that the citizens are being told by elected officials. Put politics aside and level with the people about the insolvency of this state. I do not appreciate state government under your watch that is being run like AIG. I expect to receive an answer to my questions. Thank You Larry S. Smith Constituent

Subject: State Tax Return

Comment: Good Morning, I'm expressing my frustration at the fact that my state income tax return has been filed since the last week in January, yet I have yet to receive a refund. When I access the State Revenue site I've been getting the same message for weeks, ie, "return received and being processed". When I attempt to contract the State Revenue Service all I receive is a recorded message. My entire professional career has been affiliated with federal or local government and I am conscious of the financial woes being experienced by government at all levels. However, I am mystified that the State of North Carolina has not escrowed tax money in anticipation of paying refunds, furthermore it is frustrating that no message has shown up on the state Revenue site which alerts NC tax payers to the potential that their returns will be delayed. I suppose it would be OK for the individual taxpayer to simply tell the state that he/she couldn't pay their taxes because they are experiencing "cash flow" issues. Respectfully, Bob Simpson Colonel USAF (RET)

Governor Perdue,

First of all, I think you are dong an awesome job especially with all that is going on across the state and nation right now!

I need my state tax refund!† My wife and I both lost our jobs within a week of each other last July and she is just now returning to work this month.† We have a refund due of $585 and have done everything just as we should have to insure an expedited refund.† I understand the situation the government is in and I have tried to be patient, but I had hoped that with all the stimulus money flying around we would have seen something before now.† When I call or go on the web, I am told the same thing over and over again - return has been accepted and is in processing.† With us being out of work and only me on unemployment, this refund is vitally important to us and is causing us to have to do without - sometimes even with food.† My 3 kids have really known what sacrifice is lately.† Is there anything that can be done to speed things up?† I really, really need this money this week.

Thanks,

Paul Kennedy

RE: NC Dept of Revenue, refund

Dear Governor

††††††††††† I hope you can help me. The Dept. of Revenue has decided to keep approx. $1900 of my money even though the tax preparer, (H&R Block) submitted to them that a complete refund was due me.† The Local H&R office in Boone sent in a second request for the refund that was signed for on 3/04/09. I have heard nothing from the Dept. of Revenue. The original notice from the Dept of Revenue was received by me in mid Feb.that the Department had decided to ADJUST the previous return done by H&R Block. See Dept. Of Revenue Notice Number 3589 251 090 220.

†The second return by H&R block had the preparers written note on the front sheet that states ‚ÄúAttached is a copy of the W-2 from Unum Life Ins. Co. with a NC withholding of $1920.00. The Taxpayer should have this amount refunded since the J-code-(sick pay) is not taxable Also attached is a copy of the NC return. Please process refund as soon as possible‚Äù Thank You Jeanette Lyons, Tax Preparer, H&R Block-Boone,NC..

††††††††††† †By the Dept. of Revenues own rules, I am (by their rules) quickly running out of time to do anything about this. Please look into this problem ands get back to me. I am now on Social Security Disability, so this money is important.

Comment: Governor Perdue, Hello, My name is Mark Rich and I live in Mecklenburg County, Charlotte, NC and I am writing you because I am concerned with my state income tax refund. I filed my 2008 state income tax return on 3/2/2009 and still have not received my state refund. This is the same time that I filed my 2008 federal return and I received my federal refund on 3/13/2009. When I check the status of my return on the state website in only indicates, "Your tax return has been received and is in process". This has been the same message now for weeks with no additional information. This is not a helpful site! This is very frustrating because in this economy we all need all the money we can get. This is even more frustrating to me because this is money that I over paid to the state government and now they are not giving it back in a timely manner. If I owed NC state taxes I would have to pay them, the state would not allow me to use the excuse, "I will pay them in a few weeks or months when I know for sure I will have the money". Do you know why North Carolina is not sending out our state income tax refunds? Can you help with this process? Thanks, Mark Rich 1705 Pecan Ave Charlotte, NC 28205 johndoe_125@hotmail.com

Comment: Dear Governor, I understand we are in a economic crunch but citizen's state income tax is rightfully theres with no restrictions. I have paid all of my taxes on my car, which I think is crazy, taxes on my house which are unGodly! and taxes on my 2 dogs which I think is unconstitutional but I pay them. So my question is why can't I get my state income tax back. I filed on 20 Feb 09 and I still have not received my refund. I am a single mother of a 6 year old autistic son who is STILL on the CAP WAITING LIST after 2 years and I can't even get my state refund. I feel there is something seriously wrong with the state. People around me are getting paid but not me and I am sure I need it. Thanks, Udenia Icenhour

Comment: Dear Mrs. Perdue, On Feb.16, 2009 I filed my joint return income taxes electronically, with direct deposit information to my bank. According to the Dept. of Revenue (DOR) web page our account should be credited around 4 weeks. Monday April 6th I called the DOR. A representitive told me they were running "a little behind." and I could expect my refund in about 3 weeks. Madam, this is totally unacceptable. If we are 6 weeks late with our taxes, we are charged interest and penalties. If you need to use this interest free money then say so on your DOR web page so we are able to plan accordingly. Now we must borrow mony to cover debits our state return was scheduled to cover. Please have the DOR expidite the returns that were sent in a timely manner under the expectation of promt service.

Comment: Ms. Perdue: My nephew has been living in a home for the disabled in Durham, North Carolina for many years. The conditions of residency for a human being with self-respect are deplorable. The operator of this state funded home has, among other things, taken from the mail my nephew's income tax stimulus refund, never told him it was available to him, she signed HER name to the check and cashed it. Only with the help of the IRS and another relative of his has he recovered the money. She said to him - it was all just a mistake. Further information reveals they provided these guests of her home, operated and paid for by the state, are frequently given a diet substandard to the requirements of basic nutrition. This woman and her boyfriend have water vehicles, at least one Hummer, and various other elaborate possessions. The residents of the home are not allowed to check the mail, are allowed to use their computers in the presence of the owner/operator. There are many serious violations being committed in Durham, North Carolina, sort of similar to the situation of the Texans being transported to Iowa. Fear of repurcussion keeps me from identifying my nephew. Please pay attention.

Comment: I submitted my tax return electronically on March 12th. I have not received my money and I called the Dept. of Revenue only to be told that no one knows when I will get my money. This is unacceptable as a NC resident. I filed my taxes on time and followed the law and now I can't get my money from the state. I have a stack of bills to pay and I need my money now. The federal refund was deposited to my account within one week. Why is the state holding my money? Shouldn't the state have to play by the same rules as everyone else? Am I going to be paid interest on my money while it is being withheld from me? I want answers other than I don't know, which is what the lady told me on the phone today in a not so nice tone of voice!

Subject: Tax refund

Comment: I voted for you Ms. Perdue but now I must say I'm beginning to have second thoughts. The citizens of NC depend on their income tax to pay bills (just like the state is trying to do). If I owe you money you haress me until you get it charging me penalties and interests. Yet, I cannot get anything from the state. I filled my taxes the third week of February, 2009 and have not recieved my refund yet. I need this money just as much as the state, if not more! Please stop holding on to something that does not belong to you, it's mine, not yours! I have considered contacting an attorney to see if I can sue the state for penalties and interests, and if this nonsense continues another week, you can rest assured I will. There is someone out there that will gladly take the case and the way the publics feels about the situation, I'm sure I would win!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you for looking into this and getting back to me ASAP.

Subject: NC State Income Tax Refund

Comment: I think it is unacceptable that our NC State Income Tax refunds are being held "hostage". People need that money to pay mortgages, personal expenses, etc. I will certainly remember this when the next election comes around. I want to know when I will be receiving my refund? In process is NOT an answer....NC should pay us interest for using our money as they are.

Subject: NC Tax Refund

Comment: I filed my NC state income tax return on March 3, 2009. To date, I have not received the overpayment of taxed in the form of a tax refund. When I call the NC IRS, they tell me they do not have the funds to repay me. This is an absolute OUTRAGE!!! The state needs to get its fiscal house in order and fire some people and/or reduce salaries across the board by 30-40% like the rest of the private sector. I have bills to pay and NEED my overpayment sent to me within the 4-6 week window as promised. If I delayed payment to the state, I would be hounded with interest and penalties. I EXPECT equal treatment under the law runs both ways!!!!!!!!! I want and need my overpayment check by April 30th and I expect a response from you regarding this matter. May 31th will not due as an answer. Free Tax Savings Tip #1: Fix local schools by firing bad and incompetent teachers. This would eliminate excessive busing saving millions of tax payer dollars per year and at the same time reducing greenhouse gases.

Subject: When can I expect my state tax return?? Been gone over two months

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, We filed our income tax now over two months ago. When we filed we were to get the federal refund in six days which we did. The State was supposed to be soon to follow. We're trying to wait patiently but we have a special needs child with Autism. I do not have the money to get her medicine refilled. She needs it and we don't get paid again until April 24th which is Friday week. We did file electronically . Is there any way you can help us recieve this? I hate to sound as though we're desperate but we really do not have any money to get this medicine. If you know anything about Autism, you know there cannot be a lapse in meds or these children suffer critically when they don't have the meds they need. My husband works for Buncombe County Sheriff's Department and is over the Crime Prevention unit. Officers do not make a lot of money doing this and right now he is hampered from extra duty jobs because I have just had surgery for 5 Kidney Stones and am out of work. Any help that you could offer to help speed this process up would be greatly appreciated. Sincerely yours, Marisa Oxner

Subject: State Income Tax Refunds

Comment: Governor, I think it absolutely insane that the NC Department of Revenue is holding the taxpayers refund money hostage. With unemployment running rampant the state needs to get off its duff and send the people the money that is owed them so that they can pay bills and maintain their lives.

Subject: Complaint against Tax Office for Refunds

Comment: Good Afternoon: We are a family of five living in Cary, NC going on our second year and I must say that I am highly disappointed in the way things are being settled regarding tax refunds. I do understand what has happened regarding the economy but no one deserves to be disrespected. Today I called the tax refund department about my refund status and found myself hung-up on for a simple inquiry. Everyone, including myself have been going through tough times with reduction in income still trying to hold on to our homes and wouldn't expect such treatment. My refund was filed electronically on March 2nd and I know of a gentlement who filed electronically on February 27th who has gotten his refund 2 weeks ago. Are you telling me that no refunds have gone out within 2 weeks. I'm only one business day after the gentlement who filed his. I thought this was based on first come first serve basis. I consider myself to be a hardworking christian mother trying to survive in this economy and doesn't seem as though North Carolina holds those same values. I think I might have picked the wrong state to teach my children kindness and respect. Thank You & God Bless Renee Allen

Subject: STATE INCOME TAXES

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, My husband and I filed our state incomes taxes electronically through our accountant on March 12th. We are due a refund. I was given 2 numbers to call which I have done twice and keep getting the answer, our reund is being processed. I was told during one phone call that they are behind in getting checks cut. In addition, getting through using the 2 phone numbers is really confusing. It's quite unsettling to know this is how our state IRS is run. What can you do to help us, and others, get our refund soon? Thank you.

Subject: 2008 Tax Refund-Long Wait

Comment: I'm aware that we are in an economic crises...However, my tax refund money that is due me, comes from my hard earn income that I worked very hard for in 2008. Being that we are going through an economic hardship...I find it inconsiderate that the state is creating more of a hardship on the working people and adding to the "pain in our pockets". I hear the explanation in the news...It's not a good thing to do to us, since this state did receive bail out money and I feel you are behaving just like the banking executives that took the initial bailout money. Just sign me as a very unhappy tax person.

Subject: Retroactive reduction in Teacher's Pay

Comment: Today I am disgusted with the government of the state that I have lived in my entire life. It's one thing to impose a salary reduction on FUTURE EARNINGS, but to make a RETROACTIVE reduction 10 months into a year and have it deducted in the next two months is both outrageous and grossly unfair. Adding insult to injury is the fact that most of these teachers are still waiting to receive their N.C. State income tax refunds from LAST YEAR. I am ashamed of my state. Gov Perdue is totally out of touch with the citizens of North Carolina. And no, I'm not a teacher.
