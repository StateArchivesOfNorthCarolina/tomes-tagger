Subject: Military - OLF

Comment: NE NC for 8+ years has been telling the Navy no thank you, we do not wish to host an OLF training facility for the operational flexibility and noise mitigation that will benefit Oceana residence in Virginia. The Navy has not provided a need based argument that supports condemning a community in our state. We have been under the threat of this condemnation and have actually had/have a Record of Decision by our Navy to condemn 30,000+ acres of land in Washington and Beaufort Counties. The Navy should have a similar ROD around Oceana if they are making decisions uniformly across the several states. In 2005-2006 time frame you made a comment something along the line of an OLF should not be forced on any community. I believe you where the 1st senior representative to make a statement along those lines. Is that an accurate assessment of your stance regarding this OLF? If it is accurate, will you please explain to the Navy that their practice of changing their requirements or their story has got to stop. The people of NE NC have very little confidence in what the Navy is telling us now. The Navy will not talk with us in an open forum. The Navy will not show how the two sites, Camden and Gates County where chosen as finalists for this current NEPA process. The Navy cannot provide a need based statement backed with any kind of facts or scenarios that support them even looking at NE NC. The rational for coming to the region is for the benefit of Virginia residence. I understand the importance of the training an OLF does for our pilots. I feel I understand it better then the Navy does. The Navy insists that all 4 sites must be utilized to perform these training missions. The Navy is only concerned with a proper training facility at the 2nd OLF site. The Navy is willing to usurp the police authority of the local governments in our state by condemning properties but will not do that around Oceana. If the Navy was serious about preserving Oceana they would be condemning properties and would have been doing it since 2003. They have not. In fact, they are requiring the cities supporting their Oceana runways to support the mission. The Navy has indicated that it is unsafe and living in the higher noise zones is incompatible with the mission of fighter jet training. As evident by the Harrier crash, the F/A-18 crash near Miramar and the practice bomb that dropped around Oceana in Fall 2007, the Navy is correct. They must have a airfields free of incompatible development. The only problem is the Navy will only do this in North Carolina if one of our two sites is the preferred site. The Navy showed us what should happen around an airfield with their Washington County decision. Condemn properties out to the 60 dB DNL contour line. That same decision must be happening around Oceana, Fentress and NS Norfolk. Failure by the Navy indicates they ARE overstepping their authority and are not making decisions across the several states uniformly. The Navy is claiming they do not have the darkness capacity to perform the training mission in the summertime. The Navy has an agreement that they will curtail, or restrict the same missions they say they do not have the capacity to perform at Oceana. It is my contention that if the Navy flew at their home base and removed the word ALONE in their need based statement found in the Notice of Intent, they would have the capacity needed. The last model the Navy provided us, Alternative 6, the showed that from 10pm to 7 am for the entire year the Navy was going to perform five FCLP operations. This is the same mission the Navy is now telling us they do not have the capacity at Fentress alone in the summertime to perform. In a surge environment, the assets on the entire east coast could be pressed into service to support this 30 day surge. Again, no community in NE NC should be asked or required to host this OLF as the Navy does not have a valid need. For our pilots training, please do not allow the Navy to force this OLF on any community in our State. Why I say for our pilots? If the Navy does not have this 2nd OLF, the Navy will be forced to fix Oceana and fly training missions at that airfield. Oceana should be supporting Fentress. The Navy's argument is they cannot fly at Oceana because of the light and people encroachment so they must have another OLF. The Navy insists our pilots will continue to fly at Oceana, but the training fidelity is terrible at those airfields. For our pilots, the Navy must fix Oceana or abandon the mission. If we give our pilots this OLF, they will still have to perform training missions at Fentress, Oceana and NS Norfolk. Those pilots that have to fly at the old sites will be getting degraded training and will continue to receive degraded training forever. I contend that what will happen is the next BRAC or other capacity determining body will say that the Navy has to many OLFs to support Oceana. Remove one of them. Fentress will be removed. All the training flights from Oceana will then be sent to that 2nd OLF site. The impact will be greater then what is being told to us now. At that time, it will be too late. One of our communities will be forever gone to support the greed and mismanagement of Virginia Cities. My contention is fix Oceana and a 2nd OLF is not required. In their last study, the Navy stated 3 different times in their narrative and numerous times to concerned citizens that Oceana did not require an OLF. I believe them. Because of the history by the Navy of changing their story, it is near impossible to believe what they are saying now. This latest tale by the Navy is an example. Please do not let the Navy take from our County Commissioners the power of directing their respective counties future. The Navy has failed to work with the region. Please require the Navy to work with us, to talk with us, to establish a point of contact with us that is knowledgeable on the subject and who has the authority to tell us the proper story. I ask that a Naval Officer vice a civilian be our liason. The civilian will tell us anything, but the Officer would be honor bound to properly represent the Navy.The Navy's official website for this OLF is pathetic with regard to information on WHY they are putting NE NC through this hell the original 5 sites went through. Please stop the madness. Please politely but firmly explain to the Navy that the people of NE NC understand the importance of the mission they do, but that the Navy has not provided a compelling reason that justifies any community to be forced by our Navy to host this OLF. The region has not provided the Navy with a justification to summarily take the police authority from our local governments. Thank you for your time,

Good morning Governor Perdue,
,
I read in a news article that Senator Hagan is meeting with you today.
I am writing to respectfully ask that you will discuss the OLF
situation in Gates County, NC. The people here have been struggling to
oppose the OLF since September, 2007. We had promises from Senator
Dole that she would oppose the OLF and do everything in her power to
help the citizens of Gates County oppose the OLF, and stop it from
destroying our county and so many peoples lives. We know we do not
know all the deals that were made and discussed with the Navy by
Governor Easley or Dole and Burr. We have shown broad opposition since
we found out we were on the list for a possible siting of the OLF. We
have proof that we were on the list way back in 2003, and were taken
off because of environmental reasons and other factors, and nothing
has changed to warrant putting us back on the list in 2007.

The citizens of Gates County have not had an opportunity to meet with
you or Senator Hagan to discuss your positions on this matter. We are
begging that you discuss this situation, and offer the citizens here
some support and publicly address your position. The people of
Washington County fought the OLF for 7-8 long years, and only had the
support of Governor Easley and Senator Dole near the end of their
struggle. We are asking you and Senator Hagan, Senator Burr and
Congressman Butterfield to join forces and support the people of Gates
County in their opposition to an OLF being sited here. We have no idea
what your current position is, and how you will help us stop the OLF
from being sited in NE NC.

I know you have many important issues to discuss, stimulus package,
economy, etc. but this OLF situation is on the top of the list to
hundreds of people in Gates and Camden counties. We need your help and
support, now is the time to show the citizens how sincere you are in
protecting and serving the citizens of North Carolina.

Our citizens group has been requesting a meeting and have not gotten a
response as to when we may be given a meeting time. We know you are
extremely busy in these first few weeks in office, but we feel it is
imperative to us, as the OLF will negatively impact our futures in
every way. It would mean loss of homes, jobs, inheritance, loss of
farm lands, timberlands, adverse effects on wildlife and state parks,
pollution to our rivers, pollution to our lands, pollution to our
health, loss of wetlands and the list goes on and on.

I am respectfully asking that the topic of the OLF be discussed today,
and you assign someone on your staff to convey that discussion to the
citizens of Gates County, and hopefully keep us informed of any
contact or discussions that may take place now or in the future
concerning the OLF in NE NC.

Thank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter concerning
the OLF in this demanding time period of office.

Sincerely,

Elaine B Herring

Subject: OLF & Economy

Comment: When will Governor Perdue address the OLF situation in NE NC? These counties are already struggling with the current economy and are under extreme distress about the OLF and how it got started behind closed doors by Governor Easley and Bill Ross. The Navy are constantly reverse engineering information about the whole EIS process, they are NOT working with the local communities. This OLF proposal will adversely effect many other counties besides the 2 targeted for the OLF. We need Governor Perdue, Lt. Gov Dalton, and Secretary of DENR to address this situation, to be honest with the citizens of NC and show her position and what she is currently doing to help the citizens of NE NC.We need to know what meetings she has had with the Navy concerning the OLF,since she has formally taken office. What is Governor Perdue going to do to help the people of Gates and Camden counties?

Comment: As a resident of NE NC. I strongly oppose the OLF. The state of VA has a OLF in Fentress, & the Navy has yet to prove they need a Second OLF. If Oceana Can not train then Ocean need to go away. Having a East Coast Master Jet Base that can not perform the Duties and Functions then, build a New MJB. Not a second OLF. Again a second OLF is not the answer, the City of VA Beach needs to held accountable for the buildup around Oceana, the residents of NENC do not want the noise that VA Beach and Chesapeake want to export. We need your support in Fighting the Navy and this OLF.

How many in VA? With our current economic crisis, the Navy and DOD needs to look internally, they have so many specialized units, and they want everything separate for everything. The marines are part of the Navy, both fall under Dept Navy, can't they share airfields? Can't an airfield be used for more than one purpose? We need to ask these questions, now.

Dear Governor,

Congratulations on your election! 

I'm writing to respectfully request your help in opposing the U.S. Navy's plan to locate an Outlying Landing Field (OLF) at any of the sites that would create increased military jet traffic over Currituck County, one of the fast growing areas in the country.  I'm sure that you are receiving numerous letters on this subject, so I won't go into great detail about the devastating effects it would have to our economy, ecology and quality of life.  We have only to look North across the Virginia border to Chesapeake and Virginia Beach to see the impact an OLF has on a community.

My family and I support the military mission, but the Hales Lake site is NOT the appropriate solution to the Navy's problem with their Master Jet base and OLF in Virginia.  In Virginia's case, the Navy was there first. 

I moved from Chesapeake, VA to Moyock, NC four years ago to be able to enjoy the quiet, rural surroundings.  I've lived within a few miles of the OLF at Fentress Field some years ago and have endured the nightly touch-and-go's at all hours of the night during the first Gulf War, when the jets were not nearly as noisy as the new Super Hornets.  I was able to move to another location in Chesapeake away from Fentress before eventually coming to Moyock.  

I'm currently a real estate agent licensed, and doing business in both South Hampton Roads, VA and Northeastern NC. This proposed OLF has already had a direct impact on my NC business. I would be closing on a brand new $450K home this Friday in Moyock, if not for the threat that the home will be in one of the noisiest areas of the proposed flight path. Looking at the flight path, finding an alternate site within miles presents the same dilemma. 

I similarly lost a land deal in South Mills, Camden Co. a few months back, while buyers from VA wait to see the outcome of the OLF issue. The final decision is not scheduled until the Summer  of 2010.  It's hard to say what the total impact of the OLF has already presented to our slowed market,  but it certainly hasn't helped and continues to cast a cloud over our market for another year and half. 

Please join our citizens, County Commissioners, State legislators and Congressman in strongly opposing the Navy's consideration of the NC OLF sites that would forever negatively change the future of Northeastern NC.

Sincerely,

Mary F. (Toni) Tabb

X-Folder: OLF

Dear Governor Perdue,
I have posted emails on your town forum, and received no information
or contact. To this point your town forum is useless to private
citizens that need your help. I live in Gates County and have been
emailing for help and support opposing the OLF in NE NC. It has been
an ongoing battle since Easley picked our county without our
knowledge, that we were being considered for an OLF. The whole process
from the beginning was unfair and unjust to the citizens of Gates
County. We all know that Washington County was a poor decision by
Easley and the Navy. Once Easley decided to ask for congressional help
to take Washington County off the Navy's OLF , every state department
came forward to find reasons for the poor choice. I do not understand
why Easley decided to " rob from Peter to pay Paul". Every site in the
past and the present have unique qualities and features that clearly
shows an OLF would do considerable harm to the land and it's people.

Gates County has many attributes that should deter an OLF, many of
which the state has used tax payer money to buy and build for the
future. We have Merchant's Millpond State Park, and is currently
building a new visitor center valued over 3 million dollars to
complete. The state last year used tax payer money to purchase the
Chowan Swamp Game Lands along the Chowan River. The purchase was for
over 9,000 acres for conservation and preservation, and intended for
all North Carolinians to enjoy for future generations. There are many
opportunities for tourism and outdoor activities that could be
developed with this large land purchase that would benefit the county
and the state.

North Carolina government seems to want to be a leader in conservation
and moving forward with green projects and good strong growth, but the
left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. Why would we
waste so much money buying and preserving and then turn around and
risk all the good efforts to be impacted? The OLF will not bring good
economic growth to these poor counties, it will only burden and impact
these poor rural counties. The Navy has so many alternatives that
would not impact rural communities, they own many thousands of acres
of land in NC, many abandoned or little used airfields and military
installations. We are asking for you to use your resources and power
to look for alternatives to helping the Navy without impacting these
poor rural counties. Many counties around Cherry Point have indicated
they would welcome the OLF to enhance the military presence in our
state, why are these alternatives not being considered?

This whole OLF situation is about noise, pollution and encroachment
with Oceana in Virginia. The citizens of NC should not be forced to
correct the problems of Virginia Beach and Chesapeake, and poor
planning and control of the Navy. BRAC 2005 decided that Oceana could
house and properly train 8 squadrons without an additional OLF, and
that Cherry Point would receive 2 squadrons. Politics weighed heavily
on that decision, and if Oceana could not provide that training, then
one of the other alternates should have occurred, which could have
resulted more military economics for NC.

The local government and the citizens group in Gates County need your
help and your support. We have been asking for information and a
meeting with you. We need to know your position on the OLF in NE NC.
When you were lieutenant governor you stated you would not support an
OLF in these counties if there was broad local opposition. We have
clearly demonstrated we are totally opposed, and would like the
opportunity to sit at the table and discuss this situation with you.
It is very frustrating for us, we have been dealing with this
encroachment in our lives since September 2007. We spent countless
hours of emails, meeting, phone calls, trying to express our
opposition, and asking for help and support, and now we have new
officials it's like starting all over again. We really need your
attention and help now. I know you have many issues that demand your
time and attention, but we feel this is a large issue that will impact
all of NE NC. I know you are facing many issues with the economy in
our state, but you must realize that Gates County has all the same
issues as all of North Carolina regarding economy and health, but we
have the added burden of loss of homes, farms, inheritance, loss of
wildlife and natural resources that other areas of North Carolina are
not facing.  We are respectfully asking for your help, and hoping you
will make time to visit Gates County to address the officials and
citizens of Gates County. I hope you will find time in the near future
to address the OLF situation in Gates County, and provide transparency
to this issue. Confirmation by you or your staff would be greatly
appreciated.

Good morning,
I am writing today to see if you can clarify some information. When
Gates County had our public hearing fall 2007, and our scoping meeting
May 2008 the information about how far the Navy was willing to look
for alternatives, we were given data that said 50 miles. During the
course of the OLF project that figure seems to have changed quite a
few times. I believe it went from 50 to 70, and then to 90 miles over
the last year or so.

In the interview Admiral Anderson, Ted Brown and Rich Catoire provided
to the Tidewater News in Franklin, Va. it seems that number has
changed again. I believe the Navy is now saying they would be willing
to expand to 120 miles. If this information is correct, is the Navy
looking at other alternatives at this point in time?

Will the new mileage criteria be included in the EIS process? Will the
new mileage data be included in the Draft EIS that is due out this
summer?

If this new mileage data is correct, would that bring new sites to the
OLF Project that may have been previously considered and dropped?

It is critical that all sites be given  true, transparent information
as we progress in this progress.

Thank you for your time and attention addressing my concerns.

Sincerely



Elaine Herring

Subject: OLF

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, The citizens of Gates County need you support in their fight to preserve their quality of life in rural Gates County. I am a 57 year old retired school teacher who has lived and taught in Gates County most of my life.Presently, I tutor 2 days a week at my old school. Seven households of my family members live in the proposed contour of the Sandbanks Site.I surround myself with my children,grandchildren,nieces, nephews and cousins.There are 3 registered Century Farms at present that we live on. My family has been rooted in the soils of Gates County for over 200 years.Four old homes (200+years)are presently being lived in by descendants of my ancestors.All of these homes lie in the contour. We have always been proud of our state and loyal citizens.Now we feel as if our previous elected and appointed officials have thrust us into an unbearable plight,for we are in danger of losing control over our homes,land,and family oriented way of life.We are all living under a dark cloud that appears to us as we awaken every morning,the threat that at the end of this very lengthy process that the Sandbanks Site will be the Record of Decision. We are a productive family of school teachers,nurses,farmers and technically trained skilled workers.We and our ancestors have worked hard and sacrificed to keep this land in our family.We are a frugal lot and have not lived beyond our means so that ownership and control of our land and our lives would always be possible.Now the Navy with the help of former state officials are trying to take that away from us. The citizens of Gates Couunty and my family need for you to make a strong statement to the Navy that we are not for sale.We deserve to continue to live our lives in peaceful tranquilty among those we love. Please help us! Respectfully' Catherine Jernigan 387 Gatlington Rd Gates,NC27937

Dear FOIA Coordinator:

This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).

I request that a copy of the following documents be provided to me:
1) Maps showing potential flight paths for proposed OLF at the Sandbanks site in Gates County, N. C.
2) Maps which include noise contours,&nbsp;potential accident zones, state roads, state owned land, and the Chowan River for the 25,000-30,000 acres of land required for the proposed OLF at the Sandbanks site in Gates County, N. C.
In order to help you determine my status for the purpose of&nbsp;assessing fees, you should know that I am an individual seeking information for personal use and not for a commercial use. I request a waiver of fees for this request because disclosure of the requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the DoD and is not requested for any commercial interest. The sole purpose of this request is to provide residents of Northeastern N. C. and Southeastern Va. with information regarding their proximity to the proposed OLF Sandbanks site in Gates County, NC. so they may determine possible impacts to their community, families, homes, farms, land, wildlife and natural resources.
I have included a telephone number at which I may be contacted if necessary to discuss any aspect of my request.

Following is email correspondence, in which I am asking the Navy for realistic maps, showing
 land requirements and flight paths for the proposed OLF.  There are many people living
 in these projected sites who have no clue that they may lose or lose control of their homes, farms
 and land or be forced to endure the severe negative impacts from jet noise and pollution.
As you will read below, the Navy has no intention in providing information they surely have.
We have continuously asked for realistic information, with no results.  We have made many
FOIA request, all have been denied.
This is just an example of how the Navy is doing business, just as it did in Washington County.
Please, work to ensure the good people of northeastern NC never again have to endure this
type of abuse by having these sites removed for consideration for an OLF.

Dear Ms. Warren,
Much of this information is what is being developed through the EIS
process.  The sound contours, for example, required ambient sound studies in
order to determine the shape and magnitude of the contours.  I'm sure you
recall the sound level measurements we took in Gates County in November as
part of the noise study.  Since this is part of the study, the information
was not available at the scoping meetings.
The contours shown at the public scoping meetings are a rough
estimate of the contours and are available on the website at
<http://olfeis.com/alternatives.aspx>http://olfeis.com/alternatives.aspx.
The flight paths, which also contribute to the sound contour
studies, were also not available at the scoping meetings.  Because NAS
Oceana and NS Norfolk are in the vicinity of Norfolk International Airport,
we have to ensure that departure and arrival procedures for Navy aircraft
don't conflict with commercial traffic.  In addition, we've attempted to
create flight paths that avoid populated as much as possible.  As the flight
paths have been moved to reduce impact, the sound contours change. We've
spent a good deal of time going back and forth between the contour maps and
flight paths to ensure we reduce the impact as much as practical at all
sites.
Although I hadn't come this job at the time of the scoping meetings,
I believe that the best information available was presented.  I agree with
your sentiments about open and honest communication.  Since this is part of
the NEPA process, please be assured that we are taking the required "hard
look" at all aspects of this project's impact.
As we complete more of the studies, more updates should be available
on the webpage.
Thanks again for writing.  Have a great day.
Sincerely,
CDR Matt Baker

Mr. Baker,
Thank you again for responding.
I was at the scoping in Gates County, and no new information was presented
at that time, none of our questions regarding contours, noise, pollution,
etc. were truly answered.
Since the scoping was 9 months ago and since the Navy took a "hard look" at
the Sandbanks site back in 2003 and this site was not moved forward for further study,
 I feel this information is readily available and should be freely given to anyone with
interest in this area.  I understand that all studies are not complete, but
also feel the Navy has much more information that could and should be
shared.
By withholding this crucial information, many people are excluded from the
process.
I am pleased that you agree with my sentiments, to that end, I am again
submitting my same request.

Dear Ms. Warren,
I'll have to do a little research since that was well before I got
here.  Looking back at the FA-18E/F Draft Supplemental EIS, there's no
discussion of the Sandbanks site.  I'll have to see what I can dig up from
the original FA-18E/F EIS.
As soon as I find anything, I'll send you a better response.

Good Morning Ms. Warren,
I've gone back and taken a look at both the FEIS and the Siting
Study.  Neither of those documents contain any contours for Sandbanks.  I'm
assuming that since Sandbanks was not moved forward at that time for further
study no sound contours were done on the site.  In addition, the Siting
Study used and the operations model from the FEIS for development of the
contours.  
With no baseline contours developed in the Siting Study, and a
different operations model for this study, there really was not anything
that could be displayed at the scoping meetings other than what was
displayed.
I'm talking with the sound engineers today to see if when we can
fulfill your request.  I can't release an incomplete study for obvious
reasons, and I know that the contours are not final yet.
Thanks for your patience in this.  
Have a great day.

In 2003, the Sandbanks site was removed in the early stages when many sites
were being considered.
The Navy reduced the list to 5 in January 2008.  Even with the vague maps
provided to us at the public hearing, Oct. 2007 and the same maps provided
at the scoping, May 2008, I see my home and family land falling within the
area the Navy describes as incompatible for residential us, so flight paths
for me wouldn't mean much.  However, there are many residents who simply
have no idea if they are in/near the contour or under/near flight paths.
They have a right to know.
I kindly ask that you notify me when/if the Navy decides to release this
information.
Thank you,
Linda Warren

Ms. Warren,
I realize I represent the "other side" in this discussion, but I
really do understand your concern over this.
If it would help, I can offer a visit to at least discuss some of
these items with your neighbors who may not have access to e-mail.  If you
or your neighbors would like to talk in small groups, I can make more than
one trip over a few days. I'd rather not get into a major public forum -
they never seem to be very productive. 
Even if I can't discuss specific flight paths and sound contours, it
might help your neighbors to understand what constraints we have to work
with in developing flight paths.
If your neighbors would prefer not to talk, that's understandable,
but I believe I understand both sides of the issue and might be able to
provide a different perspective for consideration.
Give this some consideration, please, and let me know what you
think.
Sincerely,
CDR Matt Baker

Mr. Baker,
  Thank you for the offer, but I respectfully decline.   Without your  
ability to provide the important requested information, size of the
gathering would not matter, it would not be productive.
   My neighbors understand their property lies within the contour map that
was provided Oct. 2007 and agin in May 2008.  We were told this contour only
represents the property area the Navy would consider compensating people
for. This map does not inform people of the impact or who would be impacted.
It is not a map depicting true acreage, noise zones, flight paths, roads,
landmarks - nothing recognizable to the average citizen.
  I am seeking a truer map for those who live near this contour or under
flight paths with noise zones, roads, etc. These maps and flight paths
should have been provided to the citizens of all sites long ago.  
Surely, the Navy would not waste countless millions of taxpayer $ studying
sites without a plan to get there.
  I was hoping the Navy would be true to it's word of "transparency"  
with this second go round. I know the Navy will not provide these maps to
citizens of these site because it would add more impacted people to the
charts and more opposition.
But it would at least be honest.
  While the land in the core area may seem attractive to the Navy,   
the surrounding contour should not.This land has been tenderly care for,
 for hundreds of years by the same families.
  I want you to understand our opposition to OLF is not a statement of
dislike or disrespect for the Navy or any service or, to you personally.  My
husband, Glenn, is a disabled Vietnam veteran.  Both our fathers were proud
of their service to the Navy. Our sons and daughters are also serving today.
  We have one purpose, to protect and preserve what is most precious to us.

Dear Governor Perdue
Please read the attached email that I sent to Senator Hagan, Burr and
Congressman Butterfield, it is an important issue facing farmers in
the counties that you represent. I hope you take the opportunity to
address farming and the negative impacts the OLF  will ultimately
impose on farmers in NE NC. Please make your opinions to oppose the
OLF and to support the farmers in your counties by contacting all the
speakers at this conference, such as Commissioner Troxler and others
involved in NC farming support. Our group, Citizens Against OLF, has
been trying to get a meeting scheduled with you and that has not
happened so far, we desperately need to meet with you and discuss the
OLF impacts threatening Gates County, we need your help, support and
position.
Thank You. Elaine B Herring

Dear Senator Hagan,
I read that you and Senator Burr along with Governor Perdue are to
attend and speak at the Biotech Conference Tuesday. It is important
that the discussion about the proposed OLF in Gates and Camden
counties be a part of that discussion. We are asking that all state
officials support the citizens and farmers in NE NC.
North Carolina is one of the leading states in FARM LOSS the last few
years, that trend needs to stop. It is hard enough for farmers with
increase fuel cost, and fertilizer cost skyrocketing in the current
economy. ALL farmers need to be able to chose what crops they want to
produce, and we all know that if the Navy forces an OLF on the people
and farmers they will not have a choice. That in turn would force many
small and large farmers to abandon farming.
The OLF would also threaten many conservation measures. On my families
farm, we participate in CREP, which is a program to buffer pollutants
from fields entering creeks, streams and rivers. The program also is
designed to offer food and protection for birds and all wildlife.
Please present this OLF situation at this conference, and ask that all
the officials and participants oppose the OLF, it would be detrimental
to farmers and landowners in NE NC. Farming is a very large part of
the economy in NE NC and the OLF would threaten farmers and prevent
them from being involved with the new technologies this conference
will be offering farmers for biofuel possibilities and future economic
growth for our farmers. Thank you for opposing the OLF, and supporting
our farmers.

Good morning Secretary Freeman,

I am writing today to inquire if you have had any meetings, conference
calls or emails with anyone from the Navy concerning the OLF in Gates
and Camden counties? I know you are new to this position, and I am
concerned as to the degree of historic  knowledge you have gathered
concerning the OLF in Washington County, and the current EIS and the
involvement of state employees providing information to the Navy
concerning Gates & Camden Counties.

Have you had meetings with Governor Perdue to discuss the state's
position concerning the OLF issue? If so, I am requesting all
information concerning this OLF project.
Have you had meetings or exchange of information with the Navy and any
of the OLF project managers? If so, I am requesting copies of all
information exchanged with the Navy.

I am requesting copies of any emails, transcripts, recorded
conservations, or meetings between DENR and all departments governed
by DENR, and the Navy addressing the OLF in NE NC.

Transparency in government is of the utmost importance, and the
citizens have every right to know what discussions or exchange of
information between all NC departments and the Navy that has
transpired since you were sworn into office. All information
concerning the OLF should be a matter of public record and accessible
to all the citizens of North Carolina. I am requesting a waiver of any
fees involved to honor my request, as this request is to inform and
educate all citizens of Gates County of the factors surrounding the
OLF issue in our county.I would appreciate a timely response to my
request for information, and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am sending a letter I received from NC Commissioner of Agriculture
addressing his concerns for farm loss. I feel that Mr Troxler must
have discussed his position on the OLF and the implications it will
have on NC farmers and agricultural uses of land in NE NC. We need all
NC DENR departments to step forward and and support the opposition to
the OLF in NE NC. There are so many issues involved in the OLF project
that will deeply impact all the citizens of NE NC, and we need to move
forward and stop the progression of these studies and the implications
that are ruining so many people's lives. If the OLF was a good
development, wouldn't Virginia being fighting to get it, as they are
fighting to keep a carrier from going to Mayport? Please publicly
support the citizens of NE NC and all the state officials that are
willing to protect and serve the citizens of NE NC. We need you and
ALL our NC officials to come to the aid of the people of NE NC.
Stopping the OLF in NE NC would be a hugh relief and great economic
stimulus package for every citizen in Gates and Camden Counties.  I am
asking that you provide copies of all information relating to the OLF
in Gates County that you are involved in. Only then can the citizens
see the transparencies involved in the Navy's OLF project. I want to
thank you for your time and attention helping the citizens of NE NC.

do not believe the Navy has demonstrated an honest need.
Please, as our new governor, join our senators, congressmen and representatives and make a bold, public statement

Dear Governor Perdue,
I have posted emails on your town forum, and received no information
or contact. To this point your town forum is useless to private
citizens that need your help. I live in Gates County and have been
emailing for help and support opposing the OLF in NE NC. It has been
an ongoing battle since Easley picked our county without our
knowledge, that we were being considered for an OLF. The whole process
from the beginning was unfair and unjust to the citizens of Gates
County. We all know that Washington County was a poor decision by
Easley and the Navy. Once Easley decided to ask for congressional help
to take Washington County off the Navy's OLF , every state department
came forward to find reasons for the poor choice. I do not understand
why Easley decided to " rob from Peter to pay Paul". Every site in the
past and the present have unique qualities and features that clearly
shows an OLF would do considerable harm to the land and it's people.

Gates County has many attributes that should deter an OLF, many of
which the state has used tax payer money to buy and build for the
future. We have Merchant's Millpond State Park, and is currently
building a new visitor center valued over 3 million dollars to
complete. The state last year used tax payer money to purchase the
Chowan Swamp Game Lands along the Chowan River. The purchase was for
over 9,000 acres for conservation and preservation, and intended for
all North Carolinians to enjoy for future generations. There are many
opportunities for tourism and outdoor activities that could be
developed with this large land purchase that would benefit the county
and the state.

North Carolina government seems to want to be a leader in conservation
and moving forward with green projects and good strong growth, but the
left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. Why would we
waste so much money buying and preserving and then turn around and
risk all the good efforts to be impacted? The OLF will not bring good
economic growth to these poor counties, it will only burden and impact
these poor rural counties. The Navy has so many alternatives that
would not impact rural communities, they own many thousands of acres
of land in NC, many abandoned or little used airfields and military
installations. We are asking for you to use your resources and power
to look for alternatives to helping the Navy without impacting these
poor rural counties. Many counties around Cherry Point have indicated
they would welcome the OLF to enhance the military presence in our
state, why are these alternatives not being considered?

This whole OLF situation is about noise, pollution and encroachment
with Oceana in Virginia. The citizens of NC should not be forced to
correct the problems of Virginia Beach and Chesapeake, and poor
planning and control of the Navy. BRAC 2005 decided that Oceana could
house and properly train 8 squadrons without an additional OLF, and
that Cherry Point would receive 2 squadrons. Politics weighed heavily
on that decision, and if Oceana could not provide that training, then
one of the other alternates should have occurred, which could have
resulted more military economics for NC.

The local government and the citizens group in Gates County need your
help and your support. We have been asking for information and a
meeting with you. We need to know your position on the OLF in NE NC.
When you were lieutenant governor you stated you would not support an
OLF in these counties if there was broad local opposition. We have
clearly demonstrated we are totally opposed, and would like the
opportunity to sit at the table and discuss this situation with you.
It is very frustrating for us, we have been dealing with this
encroachment in our lives since September 2007. We spent countless
hours of emails, meeting, phone calls, trying to express our
opposition, and asking for help and support, and now we have new
officials it's like starting all over again. We really need your
attention and help now. I know you have many issues that demand your
time and attention, but we feel this is a large issue that will impact
all of NE NC. I know you are facing many issues with the economy in
our state, but you must realize that Gates County has all the same
issues as all of North Carolina regarding economy and health, but we
have the added burden of loss of homes, farms, inheritance, loss of
wildlife and natural resources that other areas of North Carolina are
not facing.  We are respectfully asking for your help, and hoping you
will make time to visit Gates County to address the officials and
citizens of Gates County. I hope you will find time in the near future
to address the OLF situation in Gates County, and provide transparency
to this issue. Confirmation by you or your staff would be greatly
appreciated.

Dear Governor Perdue,
I have been emailing from your web site and directly to your office asking for help and support concerning the OLF proposal for Gates & Camden counties. I realize that Governor Easley put these counties on the list for the Navy without conferring with our US Senators and Congressmen. There are a lot of citizens whose lives will be severely impacted if the Navy is allowed to force an OLF on these communities. I am sending you population information on how many NC citizens lives will be impacted, hopefully to draw your attention to the fact that this is an important issue that needs to be addressed immediately. 
US Census 2000 2006 Estimate
Gates County 10,516 11,527
Hertford County 22,601 23,581
Camden County   6,885   9,271
Currituck County 18,190 23,770
Throughout your campaign you have promised to make our government under your command to be open and transparent, and said you would hit the ground running and not stop until you have made our government work for the people. Where is that commitment? As you can see by the sheer numbers above, you have a responsibility to address our concerns and offer us your help and support. Gates & Camden had a meeting with Senator Burr in Camden Wednesday, he was willing to take time out from his busy schedule to listen to the people he represents, and we are very grateful for his support. He also conveyed that as governor, you hold the key to every project that happens in NC. I know that you control DENR and all departments governed by DENR, and I know that in the Washington County OLF issue that employees under DENR were issued gag orders. That is no way to govern and represent all interest in our state. You also control every department that would give clearance on all state environmental issues, and permits. The Navy is not working with the local governments or the people that live in these impacted communities.
We are not asking you simply tell the Navy NO. We know the military plays a major economic role in parts of NC. The citizens here realize you have a responsibility to encourage military growth. The main issue with the proposed OLF is to relieve noise, pollution and encroachment around Oceana. The navy is not offering to build a Master Jet Base in Gates & Camden counties, they only want to export the negatives to make Oceana and Virginia more viable and retain all the federal dollars that accompany the squadrons. Virginia is looking to preserve their economy and degrade NC's. The encroachment issues of Oceana should not be put upon the backs of rural citizens, there is no economic incentives involved with the OLF in Gates & Camden counties. 
There are too many issues to include in an email surrounding the OLF in Gates County, that is why I am requesting that you schedule a meeting as soon as possible with Gates County officials and our citizens group to address the Navy's Proposed OLF sites.  You say you are dedicated to serving all North Carolinians, and you say you know rural communities and agriculture are an important part of our state and it's history. I would appreciate a confirmation of this email, and a response on when you feel you will be able to address the OLF situation in Gates County. The people are waiting for support and direction from our new governor

Comment: Gov. Perdue - I know you have lots of problems to deal with - however, home prices in our area haven't just dropped - they have stopped. The threat of an OLF hanging over our community has brought us to a standstill. We have lived under the flight path for Oceana (VA) and we couldn't get out soon enough. We are not alone - Currituck is the fastest growing community in NC because people are trying to escape Virginia Beach and the jet noise. They want a peaceful life - to come home after work and relax without jets flying over your home. All aspects of our life will suffer if the Navy relocates the noise from Oceana here in our community. Please come to our community forum on February 28th. We need your support and we are begging for your support. Please help us. Please imagine jets flying over your home and school 24 hours a day. We have support of our Representatives - why can't we get yours?

Madame Governor,
Congratulations on be elected as my Governor. I live in Perquimans County. I am opposed to an OLF in NE NC.

When the Navy was looking at my county, I was a lead fighter in opposing this OLF. At one point in this fight a rumor came out that Lt Gov Perdue made a statement, "the OLF should not be forced on any community", or words to that effect. This comment came out way before Senator Dole made her statement about "broad local support". I felt that rumor was the first which made you the first "big" politician to join the local community and local government in empowering them to believe that they had a say in what happened to their community with regard to this OLF. Shortly after this rumor, other politicians started empowering the communities. Why I say rumor is I cannot find a hard statement by you during that time. I think I remember seeing someing in the News & Observer, but I cannot find it.

As my governor, what is your stance on this OLF in NE NC?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to a timely answer to this important question.

Ms. Perdue,

Thank you very much for you and your staff for providing me with the updates of issues/meeting for our state.  You are the only elected official who seems concerned about their citizens. 

Thank you also for the opportunity to express my opinion regarding the OLF situation in Camden County.  I hope to meet you at the OLF meeting on February 28 at Moyock Middle School and I appreciate you taking the time to meet with us.  I was just wondering why the Navy is not represented at this meeting so this meeting will not be one sided.  If you are willing to take the time out of your busy Saturday and time away from your family, then I think the meeting should have a better purpose than to just hear people complain/reject OLF.  In my opinion, I think a Navy representative should explain exactly what the purpose of OLF is and how it will impact Camden County and the surrounding areas.  If possible, will you please recommend or invite the Navy to the meeting.  Thank you again for this opportunity to express my opinion.

By the way, my husband and I enjoy our freedom and we support OLF.  The men and women of our armed forces need all the support and training facilities to properly prepare for their mission.  If the only price we have to pay for our freedom is to listen to the sound of jet noise, then we do not have a problem.  The men and women of the armed forces and their families sacrifice a lot more than jet noise for the protection and freedom of a lot of strangers. 

Thank you again.  Have a wonderful week.

Very respectfully,
Tess and Jeff Weigold

Dear Governor Perdue:

Coal-fired power plants are the largest man-made source of mercury, and
they also produce huge amounts of dioxins and arsenic as well as other
pollutants that are closely linked to cancer.  Please do not allow Duke
Energy to use the proposed massive 800mw unit to produce coal fire!
North Carolinians want healthy air, healthy lungs and healthy children.
This is NOT in line with President Obama's clean energy proposal!!!
Duke Energy is trying to avoid having to comply with a recent federal
court ruling that ordered them to install MACT (maximum available
control technology) for hazardous emissions. My husband and are are
totally against Duke Energy's coal-fire proposal and expect them to
comply with the Clean Air Act!!  There are enough medical problems with
air pollution,  please don't let this be another iron in the fire!!   We
strongly urge you to reject their proposal.

Dear Governor Perdue,

My husband and I would like to convey our extreme opposition to the US Navy constructing and outlying landing field in Moyock, NC as well as anywhere in Northeast NC. It is not needed (as has the Navy admitted this fact) and is the primary factor in our decision for elections. It would greatly affect our property values as well as our quality of life. In this time of economic uncertainty, wasteful spending on needless construction projects in heavily populated areas would be ludicrous. We strongly oppose and outlying landing field, are active in our community and we vote. Thank you for your consideration on this subject. We would like to know your stance on this issue.

Subject: Governor Perdue's Position Regarding the Hale's Lake OLF



Hello Ms. Lichtner,



I would like to request that you speak with Governor Perdue regarding her further opposition to the placement of the Navy OLF in Camden County.  As a lifelong resident of Currituck County, I have made sacrifices to ensure that the nature of my family's upbringing be similar to mine, in a rural and peaceful setting.   However, that way of life is now being threatened by Virginians that want to only reap the benefits of military bases, while dumping the dregs of the process on North Carolinians. 



I made the choice to live here, as did my grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles, brother, and in-laws.  That choice included the cost and time to travel to services in urban areas.  It is simply unfair that the people that made a conscious decision to reside near an active master air base or an operating OLF (Oceana and Fentress, respectively) can now complain loudly enough to have the negative aspect of that benefit be moved to one of the fastest growing areas in North Carolina.



The proposed action is simply illogical, if for the reason of population growth, only.  The issue of lack of real need further supports opposition to the OLF, as well as the fact that there are better alternatives, in even more rural, slower growing areas of Virginia that are more suitable for this activity.  Frankly, that alternative is simply the only equitable answer one, as Virginia reaps the benefits, so should they deal with the negative aspects of that activity.



Thank you, in advance, for bringing this important issue to the Governor's attention.  We, the citizens of Camden and Currituck, are in dire need of her support.



Humbly,



Gary Davis

Gov. Perdue,

Please care about the people of northeastern North Carolina.  I live in Camden and am part of a farm family that has been farming in Camden over 200 years.  The OLF will destroy not only our farm but the entire county.  Please do not let the navy sacrifice us and dump their problems on us so they will be free of the problems they and Virginia Beach caused.  I lived in Virginia Beach under those jets for 13 years.  Little Camden would not survive.  People think we are just ignorant country folks few in number so they can take advantage of us.  Please stand up for this part of the state.  Please let us know you care about us and fight very hard for us.  We really need your help in a very firm and public way.

Comment: I would like to know your position regarding the potential OLF that is proposed in Camden County. This site will put my house in the noise zone and practically backs up to my back door. I currently work in Va Beach right next door to Oceana for a government contractor and I must listen to the jet noise all day. I moved to Moyock NC in 2002 from VA Beach to escape the jet noise and now they are going to follow me to NC too. I have a beautiful home on a golf course that will lose its value and will be impossible to sell even after the housing market rebounds (hopefully). Chesapeake and Va Beach VA officials have allowed the houses to creep up to the Fentress OLF and I really do not think it is fair. We have all been told in Va Beach, "if you don't lke the jet noise then move." Well I did want I needed to do, now they need to use the facilities they have in place and the residents of Chesapeake and VA Beach can just deal with the noise like I did for 16 years. Please do not allow this to happen. V/r, Jean A. Adams

Good morning Mike,
I was wondering if Governor Perdue has had time to sign any letters yet? I read somewhere that Camden said they had a letter from Perdue, I'm not sure if they were referring to a Perdue letter as governor or Lt. Governor. There has been a lot of support from other  officials, Senator Burr came to visit with Gates & Camden 2 weeks ago, and Senator Hagan is coming Friday to sit and talk with Gates & Camden about the OLF situation. Congressman Butterfield has been working to add new legislative language, and has been very vocal about his support of his constituents. Senator Basnight and Representative Owens are also considering introducing a bill, an appendix to strengthen statute 104.7. We really need some public input on where Governor Perdue stands concerning the OLF in Gates & Camden counties. I know Governor Perdue is very busy trying to balance the state budget, but we feel we need some direction from Governor Perdue and she needs to demonstrate her support publicly.
Hopefully she will consider taking a tour to the Sandbanks site and allow time to meet with county officials and our citizen's group. Sometimes a change of pace will clear your mind and allow you to come back to the table refreshed . Do you think she will be able to work a meeting into her schedule anytime soon? The Navy's draft EIS is due out early summer so we don't have much time to prepare. I appreciate all you do to make sure Governor Perdue stays on top of what is happening outside of Raleigh. Please do all you can to get us a meeting with Governor Perdue, and let me know if any letters are forthcoming. Thanks and have a great day.

Mr Arnold,
I know Governor Perdue has been extremely busy trying to balance the budget and figure how best to use the stimulus money. Everybody in NC and across the United States are feeling the crunch of the struggling economy, and each day it seems to deepen, more lay offs, more businesses closes and request for more state assistance. I am sure Governor Perdue has caught a lot of flack for her vacation taken so early in her new position, and she must realize it's hard for average citizens to understand, most can't afford to put food on the table, much less take a vacation. I must admit I was shocked that she left the country in this melt down of our economy. I love college basketball also, and I know she attended the State-Tarheel game,and that's OK, but when Gates County citizens have not heard one word from her about the OLF since she took the office of Governor, it's hard to see as handling all the pressing issues our state faces. I know I would forgo all college basketball games for an opportunity to sit and talk to her and know what her intentions are concerning the OLF. In the citizens minds she is pleasing herself before addressing the concerns from her constituents, and that's not a good image, even if the image is not a true one.

As much as I feel Governor Easley did the people of Gates County wrong by offering us up to the Navy without our knowledge, at least his staff did respond to emails and tried to answer some questions, and so far Governor Perdue has not. In our meeting Wednesday with Senator Burr, Camden residents and officials also discussed with Senator Burr, the Governor's lack of communication. I am not trying to lay blame, I know that Governor Perdue has probably had so many request for meetings since she took, and we have tried to be patient and wait for some communication from her or her staff. With that spill out of the way, I want to say I really appreciate you offering to talk and bring me up to speed on where Governor Perdue is on the OLF situation. 

You may call me anytime, I will be home most of the weekend, so I will give you my home number and my cell number

I would probably be less busy Sunday afternoon, but I will make time whenever it's convenient for you. If you want to set a particular time just email date and time.
Once again, Thank you for responding.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I have been emailing from your web site and directly to your office asking for help and support concerning the OLF proposal for Gates & Camden counties. I realize that Governor Easley put these counties on the list for the Navy without conferring with our US Senators and Congressmen. There are a lot of citizens whose lives will be severely impacted if the Navy is allowed to force an OLF on these communities. I am sending you population information on how many NC citizens lives will be impacted, hopefully to draw your attention to the fact that this is an important issue that needs to be addressed immediately. 

US Census                              2000                2006 Estimate

Gates County              10,516             11,527
Hertford County                     22,601             23,581
Camden County                        6,885               9,271
Currituck County                    18,190             23,770

Throughout your campaign you have promised to make our government under your command to be open and transparent, and said you would hit the ground running and not stop until you have made our government work for the people. Where is that commitment? As you can see by the sheer numbers above, you have a responsibility to address our concerns and offer us your help and support. Gates & Camden had a meeting with Senator Burr in Camden Wednesday, he was willing to take time out from his busy schedule to listen to the people he represents, and we are very grateful for his support. He also conveyed that as governor, you hold the key to every project that happens in NC. I know that you control DENR and all departments governed by DENR, and I know that in the Washington County OLF issue that employees under DENR were issued gag orders. That is no way to govern and represent all interest in our state. You also control every department that would give clearance on all state environmental issues, and permits. The Navy is not working with the local governments or the people that live in these impacted communities.

We are not asking you simply tell the Navy NO. We know the military plays a major economic role in parts of NC. The citizens here realize you have a responsibility to encourage military growth. The main issue with the proposed OLF is to relieve noise, pollution and encroachment around Oceana. The navy is not offering to build a Master Jet Base in Gates & Camden counties, they only want to export the negatives to make Oceana and Virginia more viable and retain all the federal dollars that accompany the squadrons. Virginia is looking to preserve their economy and degrade NC's. The encroachment issues of Oceana should not be put upon the backs of rural citizens, there is no economic incentives involved with the OLF in Gates & Camden counties. 

There are too many issues to include in an email surrounding the OLF in Gates County, that is why I am requesting that you schedule a meeting as soon as possible with Gates County officials and our citizens group to address the Navy's Proposed OLF sites.  You say you are dedicated to serving all North Carolinians, and you say you know rural communities and agriculture are an important part of our state and it's history. I would appreciate a confirmation of this email, and a response on when you feel you will be able to address the OLF situation in Gates County. The people are waiting for support and direction from our new governor

Sincerely

Comment: We would appreciate your help in discouraging the Navy fom choosing Camden Co. as the site for a OLF. We don't want our way of life ruined just so that homeowners & developers in VA who chose to buy land & homes in the existing flight paths can improve theirs & more specifically their property values. Thank you for your time & attention in this matter.

This link is a short news article on the resolution opposing the OLF
in Gates & Camden counties. Hopefully other newspapers will get this
important news out to the public and maybe it will stimulate other
environmental organizations to come forward and support the protection
of NE NC. Please take a moment to read the article and the resolution
from North Carolina Wildlife Federation. Thank you for time and
attention on this important issue facing NE NC.

Dear Governor,
Thank you for your response and support on this issue!  With all of our legislators from County Commissioners to our Senators in Washington carrying the message that the citizens in Northeast NC oppose any OLF in this area, I would hope we could stop the Navy's consideration for any sites in this area without further delay and impact to our struggling economy.
Another year and a half of delay will cost more jobs in construction, real estate and retail services, while impacting growth for years to come by investors who'll seek other areas where the threat of an OLF doesn't exist. 
Will look forward to your continued support as we come up on the next critical phase when the Navy releases their impact study 'draft' and we have another opportunity to voice opposition.

> Dear Governor,
Congratulations on your election! 
I'm writing to respectfully request your help in opposing the U.S. Navy's plan to locate an Outlying Landing Field (OLF) at any of the sites that would create increased military jet traffic over Currituck County, one of the fast growing areas in the country.  I'm sure that you are receiving numerous letters on this subject, so I won't go into great detail about the devastating effects it would have to our economy, ecology and quality of life.  We have only to look North across the Virginia border to Chesapeake and Virginia Beach to see the impact an OLF has on a community.
My family and I support the military mission, but the Hales Lake site is NOT the appropriate solution to the Navy's problem with their Master Jet base and OLF in Virginia.  In Virginia's case, the Navy was there first. 
I moved from Chesapeake, VA to Moyock, NC four years ago to be able to enjoy the quiet, rural surroundings.  I've lived within a few miles of the OLF at Fentress Field some years ago and have endured the nightly touch-and-go's at all hours of the night during the first Gulf War, when the jets were not nearly as noisy as the new Super Hornets.  I was able to move to another location in Chesapeake away from Fentress before eventually coming to Moyock.  
I'm currently a real estate agent licensed, and doing business in both South Hampton Roads, VA and Northeastern NC. This proposed OLF has already had a direct impact on my NC business. I would be closing on a brand new $450K home this Friday in Moyock, if not for the threat that the home will be in one of the noisiest areas of the proposed flight path. Looking at the flight path, finding an alternate site within miles presents the same dilemma. 
I similarly lost a land deal in South Mills, Camden Co. a few months back, while buyers from VA wait to see the outcome of the OLF issue. The final decision is not scheduled until the Summer  of 2010.  It's hard to say what the total impact of the OLF has already presented to our slowed market,  but it certainly hasn't helped and continues to cast a cloud over our market for another year and half. 
Please join our citizens, County Commissioners, State legislators and Congressman in strongly opposing the Navy's consideration of the NC OLF sites that would forever negatively change the future of Northeastern NC.
Sincerely,

Subject: OLF in Camden County

Comment: I write to express my support for the OLF in Camden County if the USN chooses Camden as the best location. We greatly benefit from Virginia jobs in Camden County and the argument that the practice field is a Virginia problem is irresponsible. If you look into it, you will find a large number of Camden residents are employed at military bases in Virginia and many are USN families stationed in Virginia but live in Camden.
