 Marine Tech Program

Dear Governor Perdue,

†I am writing today to ask you to please help in the matter of funding cuts for shipboard operations in the Marine Tech program at Cape Fear Community College† (CFCC). I discovered recently that It has been decided that funding for the operation of the research vessel RV Dan Moore be eliminated effective fiscal year 2009-2010. This action would serve to cripple one of the premier Marine Technology programs in the country at a time when many, including myself, are re-training themselves to meet anticipated workplace needs.

My own personal story is not all that uncommon these days. I feared that my computer related job would eventually be outsourced or eliminated† - my company was bought out 7 times over 11 years and the only people who profited were Wall Street. At 52 years of age, I decided to take the risk of retraining myself for a new career. The excellent Marine Tech program at CFCC offered me a viable alternative. Part of what makes this program so unique and valuable is the hands on shipboard experience we gain on our voyages - something that can't be obtained at any other institution on the East coast. I have found the shipboard experience to be immeasurably valuable, as do potential employers. With the current state of the economy I strongly feel that now is not the time to cut funding for programs dedicated to retooling the workforce.† I am hoping that this† decision can be forestalled. I would greatly appreciate your consideration in this matter.

Sincerely,

Tom Pawlicki

Dear Governor Purdue,

I have written our State representative about this issue before and received no response.

The State maintains ABC stores all over the state.† These stores, or at least the two in Henderson County, probably have four to six employees each.† Almost every time I go into an ABC store, there are as many employees as customers.† Prices are high so many people who are within 50 miles of South Carolina, Tennessee or Virginia make a periodic trip to those states to stock up on liquor.† Certainly, I know this is true of residents near South Carolina.

I assume the ABC store employees are State employees who receive all of the State benefits, healthcare, pensions, etc.† Assuming this is true, I am wondering if the profit from ABC stores pays for all of these benefits, particularly health care and pensions.† If they don't, the laws should be changed and State ABC stores should be eliminated.† Iowa had a State ABC store system some years ago.† They changed the system such that retail liquor stores are privately run.† I believe the State still supplies the retail stores from State warehouses, but I am not sure of that.† At least Iowa does not have the burden of future pensions and health care for the retail store employees.

The bottom line is, I do not believe North Carolina should be in the liquor business, a business that is more efficiently and probably more economically, handled by private business.

Best regards,

Ron Davis

   Good Afternoon Governor Perdue,
      I know it's budget time. We're all feeling the pressure. My name
is Tammy Thompson and I work for Davidson County Schools. I'm feeling
the pressure as well, being a teacher assistant. I'm aware of the
possible budget cutbacks, but please be aware of how vital our role
is within the schools before deciding to cutback the teacher
assistant positions. I would like to mention a few of our
responsibilities that you may not be aware of. The clerical portion
of our positions have all but been eliminated. We are now instructing
the children in the classroom, one-on-one instructional time with
students, small group settings, remediation, we cover classrooms to
provide the necessary planning time and duty free lunches for the
teachers, drive the buses, and monitor students at arrival and
dismissal as part of our duties. It may seem to be the quick solution
for the budget, but I feel it will only hurt the success of our NC
children. Please take a minute and visit our NCATA website to view
our thoughts and concerns. I recently sent you a letter as well, I'm
hoping that you will receive at least one of my letters.
           Thank You,  Tammy Thompson

FYI ñ A Suggestion

I would like to suggest the interesting California model to reduce personnel cost till the budget can be balanced.



California state government according to its Governor, will place workers on a paid 4 day work week. The 5th day is unpaid and no work.†



This is being done for a period of six months till the budget can be balanced.



This idea saves the jobs of State workers.

I think this idea should be considered, till the budget can be balanced.

State Health Plan Update!

RIF and Health Coverage

†Employees who lose their job as a result of a reduction in force (RIF) will continue to have coverage under the State Health Plan for up to twelve months, as long as the employee has twelve or more months of service and the employee was covered by the State Health Plan at the time of separation from service.†
†Employees may continue coverage for their eligible dependents during this 12-month period.† The employee and any dependents will remain on the employing unit's billing statement while receiving RIF benefits.† The employing unit is responsible for collecting and remitting any applicable premiums.††The State Health Plan will allow employees who have been RIFíd to change their health plan coverage (move from 80/20 to 70/30) and coverage type (employee-family to employee only), as long as the request is made within 30 days from the date of separation from service.† <http://www.shpnc.org/hbr-updates/february-2009/change-form-example.pdf>Click here for an example of the Change Form correctly completed. ††Employees who elect not to continue coverage under RIF immediately following separation may not obtain coverage at a later date.† After one year, the former employees and their eligible dependents may continue health coverage on a fully contributory basis. Former employees who choose to continue their coverage after their initial 12 months will be directly billed by Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina. ††Employees who do not have 12 months of consecutive service may continue health care coverage at full cost under COBRA (for themselves and any eligible dependents).

New Prescription Refill Guidelines

The State Health Plan for Teachers and State Employees will be following new guidelines for prescription refills beginning on March 2, 2009. The new prescription refill guidelines are being implemented to comply with pharmacy "best practice" standards and regulatory requirements. Most members will not notice a change when they order a prescription refill.† †The updated prescription refill guidelines will be used to review member prescription history to calculate when a medication is eligible for refill. <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1102467397801&e=001_-QgL7pf_rKdm6sn4YdXiXawXCHtq-Dx_7lXeCKX6XDUx3jKc9tD-HfWWrFvQwGn8etglPLg7RwXPkph90kUeP1GpgIYfE24KBydrK0H_ZIf7UOt3TdnFN0KlxcIIN6oWByJMSs33f8=>Click here to read more.







Reminder to Verify Pay Statements after Health Plan Changes

Employees should review monthly pay statements after a coverage type change (changing from employee-family coverage to employee-only coverage), which results in a change in the payroll deduction.† This is a way for you to verify that the requested coverage change was made.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Since the start of the North Carolina EDUCATION Lottery we have always purchased a few tickets a week mainly to help the schools (and of course hoping we would get lucky).† As you have decided to take education money to balance the state budget we have decided to no longer purchase North Carolina EDUCATION Lottery tickets, we will now purchase our lottery tickets in Virginia.

We feel exactly the same way about the Highway Trust Fund money being used for the general budget.† It is time someone in Raleigh learns how to reduce spending and to quit taking money from funds set aside for new highways and education.† There is no way a business could operate the way State government does.† Please rethink your position and leave the Highway Trust Fund and the Education Lottery money along.

Thank you for your kind consideration to this matter.

Sincerely,

Jack W. Hutson and Sandra W. Hutson

Subject: state budget option

Comment: State Budget option I have lived in Iowa for 36 of my 41 years. Grew up in Cedar Falls with my father being employed by John Deere and my mother was a nurse. I am a veteran of the US Navy, received the GI bill and went to college at Iowa State. I had to balance 3 parttime jobs while going to school fulltime but did not graduate. In 1998 I moved back to the cedar valley. I cannot remember all the jobs I had from 1998 to present. My employer now is the University of Northern Iowa as a boiler operator at the powerplant and have been there for 2 years now. Now that you know a little bit about me, let me tell you a little about Iowa. The state of Iowa employs 48,000 people. As in the case of most of the states , we are suffering from severe budget restrictions. When a state reduces its budget it looks for cuts in personnel, goods, and services. All of this can be translated into reduction in orders in factories which in turn causes the factories producing these goods and services to cut their budgets and layoff personel. These cuts feed themselves and cause more cuts and more cuts‚Ä¶etc. This is what is going on right now. The idea I have come up with will put $270 million into the average states budget to be used for the purchase of goods and services as well as taking people off of layoffs. All of this will be done without raising any taxes. All that would need to be done is taking a tax that is paid for by everyone and giving it to the states. If you remember last year when the price of gas was so high, Senator Mccain called for the suspension of the 18.4 cents/gallon gas and 24.4 cents/gallon diesel federal taxes from memorial day to labor day ( approx 4 months). He called this an ‚Äú immediate economic stimulus‚Äù. Shortly after that the ARTBA ( Ameriican Road and Transportation Builders Association) did a study on the drastic effects that this would cause. You can view this study by going to the ARTBA website or doing a websearch using the words ‚Äú top ten‚Äù and ‚Äúfederal gas tax‚Äù . The very first reason it states is about the $9 billion lost during that 4 month period. This means, using my vast algebraic skills, that in 6 months $13.5 billion would be generated from the tax. Doing some more math you would find that the average state contributes $270 million during that 6 month period. So, if we could make it so that the money generated went back to the state to be used for their budget to buy goods and services and bring back personel that were layed off, then maybe we could start to turn around the economy. Now, I know you are wondering about the general highway fund where the $13.5 billion originally went. This study was done back in April/May of 2008. One thing that has happened since this study has been out was the $700 billion stimulus package which gave the DOT $13.5 billion as well as the highway fund received $53.7 billion. Also, in the Omnibus 2009 bill just passed the DOT received $50 billion. Also,the 2010 budget is asking for a 2.5% budget increase from the 2009 budget. I know they need the money for increased transportation projects and personel increases but they should at least give this a look at. If you agree with this proposal please forward it to your congress representative. I am very interested in your views over this matter and would encourage any feedback you may have.

Subject: Budget cut proposals

Comment: Ms. Perdue, I am employed as a teacher assistant with Pamlico County Schools. The recent budget cut proposals are an outrage and a slap in the face to the educators of the state of North Carolina. These are the very educators who voted for you and helped to put you in office. I always thought of you as "Bev" and our friend but that opinion is changing in light of a lot of your recent "ideas". Freezing our longevity, ABC money, creating a $265,000 job for your friend Mr. Harrison are just a few important ones. If our budget is in so much trouble then why do you think we have the money to create a new position that has such an outrageous salary? It seems like that money could have been used instead of touching money that affects thousands of state employees! Our economy is already suffering. At an all time high are foreclosures, bankruptcies, unemployment, and decreased spending. People cannot pay their bills as it is and yet you want to take money OUT of our salaries that we already count on to pay the bills we have. What an adverse affect this would have on the economy. The cost of living is rising at a rapid rate and you want to give teachers an increase of only 2% and the rest of the state's employees get NOTHING!!! You think things are bad now. Just wait until so many of us are making even less under your proposals. I am sure you are familiar with the trickle-down affect. I am a single mother and a dedicated educator. I have 25 years as a teacher assistant with Fred A. Anderson Elementary. I don't think you realize how small my yearly salary is and how tight my budget is. Could you live on $23,000 a year? That is what I make after 25 years of dedicated service. I can't manage on that and I know you would not be able to do so either. My longevity and ABC money along with my tax refund and child support are all that keep me afloat at this time of the year. Take that away from me and I will not be able to pay either my rent, light bill, car payment, car insurance, water bill, etc. I do not have cable tv or trash pick up just to try to save money where ever I can. I work very hard and I am very dedicated to the children that I work with everyday. I have always tried to go above and beyond and my colleagues certainly do the same. We are some of the lowest paid professionals and paraprofessionals in the state. So, please tell me why you are trying to take money away from us that we earn, need and deserve?????????? I'm sure Mr. Harrison would NEVER agree to do our jobs for the salaries that we are paid. So, once again I ask you how you can do this to educators with a clear conscience???? Please be willing to use other avenues to balance the budget instead of taking away part of our salaries that we are entitled to and have worked very hard to earn. This should not even be legal. To TAKE someone's salary away who makes less than $50,000 a year and create a job for someone and pay them $265,000 a year. You should be willing to treat us like the professionals that we are and always will be. Sincerely, Rosemary Fulford Study Island Administrator Fred A. Anderson Elementary

Until then we don't have a paycheck coming in and the huge bills are coming daily. When our trucks are rolling we are helping the economy, now where is our help? I await your response. Thank you.

Dear Governor,

I have spent the last 34 years working in the public sector and now I find myself unable to work, and had to take a medical retirement from my job as a Police Detective with the Mount Airy Police Department that I spent 22 years devoting myself to the citizens of Mount Airy. I applied for Social Security Disability and have been turned down two times. I am waiting for a hearing before a judge, but during the mean time I am without any insurance. I draw a check for 1500.00 a month, and they want 1100.00 month for insurance. Now I don't know how to pay for the insurance, pay the power bill and buy food, along with putting gas in my vehicle to go to the doctor, oh, did I mention that I have to have my doctor write my prescriptions using the Wal Mart 4.00 List.† I see other people talking about they received disability and I can't get it.†I guess my skin color is not the right color.

Now for the reason for my writing, I have read that you plan to increase the education budget, I have a serious problem with that. First, it galls me to see all the illegal's getting use of the money. They are taking away from our American children, they are costing the school system more money because they have to employ more teachers to teach them to speak English. Then they qualify for free lunches. Secondly, can't you see that raising the taxes on cigarettes will only put more people out of work. This is not helping the economy. This "sin tax" should be attached to the "ho's" that are having babies for money. Tax them to have these children out of wedlock, that the taxpayers have to raise. I raised my two children on my own, they should have to raise theirs on their own also. I am getting tired of my tax dollars keeping of these low life's. I get mad when I see these illegal's driving new cars, bragging about getting free money for housing, health care. When I have to pay for my health care. With all my heath problems, I really get upset at them. That they are using my money, when I could use my money to pay for my heath care, but my taxes are going up to pay for illegal's.

How about trimming the fat with these programs first, then trim the fat in your own office. We the taxpayers of this state are sick and tired of hearing about more money being poured into programs for the illegal's.

Help us legal citizens get the help we need, after all we are the ones that have to pay for it!!!!!

Oh, by the way, find out why it takes someone up to two years to get a hearing for disability. I have already been waiting a year, I don't know if I can wait another year without loosing my house and everything else that I worked hard for.

It seems that early retirement packages for people who have 26-27 years 
service should be seriously considered when looking at options.  Some of 
the reasons for considering this are as follows:

1- Layoff and furloughs for employees who are within this service range 
is likely to have a long-term impact on such employees since most people 
have their highest salaries in the last 4 years prior to retirement.
2 - The retirement funds are separate so this would move a number of 
people off State Appropriated dollars.  Universities and agencies could 
be required reorganize to meet operational needs and not fill positions 
vacated by early retirements which would result in a savings in State 
Appropriations.
3- Some employees who fall within this service range would not be 
eligible for early retirement due to age if they were faced with layoff 
and this would be a very ungrateful act toward many who have given years 
of dedicated service to the University and State.  This doesn't seem be 
just, especially when many may have had excellent evaluations during 
those years of service. 
4- If folks move from a State Appropriated source of salary to the 
retirement fund as a source of salary it would have less of a negative 
impact on the future economy in North Carolina since they would still 
have a source of income comparable to their current income.
5- This option would have much less of a negative impact on families.
6 - This would only add 3-4 years to the number of years these employees 
would be in the retirement system.

Sincerely,
Wendy Mann

I am a proud 27 year state employee with the DOC. I work here att  Alexander Correctional Institution as a Food Service Manager III. I drive 102 miles a day round trip to work from Yadkin Co., where I began my employment with the department as a correctional officer. I have witnessed the evolution of DOC from 96 small field units with 9 000 inmates staffed with a bunch of farm boys with little or no training to the large Institutions we have now with over 40 000 inmates staffed with the best trained employees in the nation. Today even with the massive unemployment in the state we still are not able to hire the employees we need to staff our Institutions an maintain a safe work place, due to the freeze in hiring, and now our state lawmakers want to Furlough state employees who make over $ 30.000.00 a year, as if they don't have bills to pay like all other the other hard working employees do. Everything is going up and our pay in the department of corrections has not kept up with the cost of living npw for several years. I have reported to work on many days when I should have stayed home sick, I have well over 2 thousand hours sick time on the books and 300 hours vacation time. I have work long and hard to assure I was able to provide for my family and now we face the real possibility of as much as an 8 % cut in pay when we need it the most.    I received a notice from Yadkin Co. that my property was reappraised and increased by 30 thousand dollars or about one third. Please Please do not allow the furlough bill to pass we like every other workers in the state need every dollar we can earn just to keep up with the taxes and cost of living increases we face.

Comment: It is time to stop subsidizing the tuitions of out-of-state athletes who win full scholarships to UNC schools. This is costing taxpayers more than $8 million annually. This should be paid, if they want, by the bosters club. Our taxes should be focused on NC students. Two years ago, the state Senate balked at legislation to end the tuition break. The House had passed it by an overwhelming margin.

Comment: Please do not cut these necessary service for handicapped children. My nephew has autism and occupational therapy has helped him to not be so overwhelmed with sounds and touch and speech therapy has helped him to start talking. He was a huge self-stimulator in his own world prior to these services. He is now seeking "high fives" from us. Please keep these necessary services. The brain keeps the neuronal connections that are used the most often and the others die off as we age. The optimal time for kids to get these services is when they are young. The state will spend more money to take care of them when they are older and need institutional care. I am also an occupational therapist so in addition to seeing this first hand in my own family I have also worked with numerous families with Autism and other developmental delays. These families will be lost without services, in addition to all of the jobs that will be lost as well. Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

Comment: Thank you very much for your support of increased revenue. Part of any increased revenue needs to go to preserve the fabric of services that protect North Carolina's at-risk children. North Carolina needs safe, healthy children who can learn and grow into productive citizens. The current cuts to intervention services for children will destabilize the system and result in the loss of thousands of jobs and over a billion in lost federal Medicaid match money for our state.

"It would not be a good idea in this economic climate" you stated. So now why is it such a good idea? This is not right! How can you streamline policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. Is this not adding another government position? Is this position another 6 figure salary? Bigger government, is that what we need?

Times like this are THE reason that long-term plans should be in place to build a budget surplus during periods of economic growth (ie - like we just had for the last 7 years). Save nothing - CUT TO THE BONE or said another way...NO FREE LUNCHES.

Honestly, I am sick and tired of tax and spend politics. NO NEW TAXES GOVERNOR! PERIOD! Also, you brag about the federal dollars you took. What are the strings that are attached to that money? Care to share how you sold our sovereignty as a state to the federal government for a short term gain? See you next election governor.

Subject: problems and budgets

Comment: All across the country private corporations are slashing jobs, salaries, enforcing furloughs. yet the politicians continue to make full salary and benefits. Government just enforces more taxes to vote themselves raises. The shear hypocrisy of professional politicians is sickening. You want to put more money in people pockets, reduce some of the taxes that are gouging residents of NC to the tune of about .40/gallon. Charlotte raises its water rates using utitilies as a slush fund. Money for roads is used for private equestrian parks. People need more money in their pocket to get back to the spending levels that NC is used to having for revenue available. The more taxes that the government continues to add to its constituents the less money is available to spend thus further reducing jobs, further reducing money to spend...etc.... If you care, you will seek other options than raising taxes. NC is one of the most heavily taxed states in the US now. layer upon layer of taxing goes on. hey lets tax fuel 4 times like in NC to ensure money is being made. It gets ridiculous the greed and drive that NC has in chasing and enforcing taxes. People are struggling to get by. No one ishelping us with utilities as they continue to climb, my rates go up every year. I havent had a salary increse in 8 years or more. My taxes go up every year. Who is helping me the average guy getting boned by politicians who can vote themselves a raise every year and not be taxed on their income. Professional politicians are becoming the death of this country. You as the govenor have a chance to lead us away from this kind of behavior. Reduce salaries and force the utility companies to reduce charges as well. insurance of course goes up every year as well. Its utterly ridiculous. The people need help. If the leadership of the past is an example then we would be better without the government. So far everyone in office seems to se utterly self serving and worrying about the survival of government over the people. But without the people, there is no government. Fight for people, not the government.

Subject: budget

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue. Yes, you all have your work cut out for you. Since I have to live within a budget, the state must do the same. I favor major cuts across the board. I think we all will see just what we can do without. I am not in favor of trying to insure everyone; when the state has no money, that kind of pork is foolish. What about increasing the sales tax and gas tax. These EVERY person uses; since many individuals fail to pay their fair share of taxes, the best way to make sure we all do, is increase taxes where no one can skirt the system.. I also do not support huge tax incentives for corporations at this time. There should be other ways to lure business here rather than make us tax payers pay their obligations as well as our own. Thanks for all you do. Best of luck and you'll never make everyone happy. Just do what you know is in the best financial interest of the state. mleggett

Subject: The Police academy in Salemburg

Comment: Hello, I would like you to consider all the monies that have been put into the academy in salemburg. There rebuilding a gym and other bulidings that I feel is a waste of the tax payers money. NOT TO MENTION all the wrong doings going on down there. Ive seem people passed out on the lawn from parties the night before. If you check into things and do an investigation you will find that Chet Jernigan 2nd in command checked out a video camera 6+ years ago from the library and still hasn't returned it. If someone would walk down the halls in the support building you will see 9 out of 10 people playing games on there computer or surfing on the internet. IF you would check everyone's favorites on there computer you will find this out. I have question to believe that several people have a large amount of vacation and sick time. I know that in the past 5 years I worked there that my boss left everyday from 2:45 to 3:30 to pick up her son in clinton. I have NEVER seen her fill out a leave form. There I believe there are more people doing this. I know if you investigate you will find certain people have been using the company cars to go to raleigh to pick up supplies. HOWEVER you will find that these people spend most of there time at the NC STATE SURPLUS bidding on cars. Everytime they go to raleigh the never return back till 4:55 that day. It takes a whole day to go to raleigh to pick up a few supplies. The same people I have personally witnesses take the box truck to the NC STATE SURPLUS and purchase furniture and deliver it to there house in salemburg. IS This where our tax payers monies are going? I was told that there was no monies for raises or increases. I found out while working there from a friend in raleigh that certain people were getting raises every year. I told one of my bosses that someone was selling POT and that he needed to urine test this person. To this day the person still works there and was never tested. There is a note in the police academy welcome book in each room that say " No pot is allowed on campass. If caught you will be expelled" something like that. But that should tell you that they know that there recruiting and training pot heads to be police officers. If they had not had a problem in the past with this then why is this in there room handbook.? I know longer work there and wish not to work there. But you can see from all the trouble we have had with our state highway patrol officers in the past that this place in Salemburg needs some reconstruction of personel or perhaps closed! There is a close knit group of people down there that look after themselves and will cover for each other. I think if there are anymore cut backs they need to start there at the academy. If you decide you want names of these peoples please feel free to have your office contact me. Thank You David 910 514 8432

Subject: Budget Crisis

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue Thank you for your email concerning the budget crisis in North Carolina asking for our support for your plans to raise taxes to help education FRANKLY GOVERNOR, THIS IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE SOLLUTION I am not convinced that you and the legislature in Raleigh are doing enough to trim the fat out of the spending. Too much money has gone and continues to go to cronies, systems that do not work and on items of wasteful spending on a pet project to get another vote in the legislature. In my business career in tough times we cut out all the nice to do things and did only the minimum necessary to proceed. Every unnecessary report was eliminated, Projects were put on hold, Purchase orders canceled, Travel eliminated, Annual salary increases deferred or eliminated, Vacancies not filled, and finally people laid off. Yet you say ‚Äúwe must not cut to the bone‚Äù We at the local level see ongoing state construction, road construction, salaries of educators well over $100,000 with pay increases, electricity wasted with lights on all night, outrageous retirement packages, continued welfare programs for those here illegally, continued promotion of wasteful programs and bloated bureaucracies. I SAY IN RETURN, CUT TO THE BONE AND CUT NOW !! You see revenues falling at a high rate due to high unemployment, reduced spending by consumers and a sluggish economy. Yet your solution is to raise more taxes putting an increasing burden on TAXPAYERS who fund the state government. This is ludicrous and not sustainable. Your threat to the public for not going along with tax increases is to shut schools and lay off police and fire departments. We the People are tired of the resurrection of this failed logic. We have seen it in the past, done what was asked and a few years later we are back in the same situation. We Demand strong action now on cutting spending. We have no more money for you. . Sincerely Eric Edgerton

You need to get off the education push, trying to drive more money for education down our throats. If you really need more cuts in education, I can suggest several that would not be popular but would go a long way to trying to gap the deficence.† First, use the school buildings two shifts, before we raised our taxes and made our core manufacting business go off shore many of our factories worked two and even three shifts. Second, teach only the core subjects, English, reading, math, science, and American history. We can live without foreign lanugage classes, band, art, and other classes that kids could do after they got a basic education. Third, cut out all wasted expenditures, teaching in another lanugage other than English, athletics, there is no reason why our public schools should be used for kids to think they can run or shot their way to wealth and fame. Finally, raise the class size by 10 percent, its really not going to hurt anything, particularly if we have a s! trict disipline policy. When I and most people our age went to school we had 30-35 students per class, no cafeteria, and in a lot of cases no air-conditioning, and we made it to where we are today. Why because our parents made us do our shcool work rather than hang out at the mall our side in ur rooms listening to antiAmerican music or sending test messages, and we survived and strived. So lets take care of our parents by improving payments for elderly care, and go back to basic education. thanks, ken andrews†

I'm asking you, as one of our state's leaders, to come together with your colleagues, and to agree on a budget that helps North Carolinians through this difficult time and sets us up for future prosperity. To do that, we must raise a significant amount of new revenue. Thanks to your leadership and the leadership of your colleagues and predecessors, North Carolina has made wise investments in education, children's healthcare, and family stability. Now is not the time for you to retreat from these investments and others you have championed in the past. We thank you for supporting a balanced approach in your first budget by including new revenue that helped to prevent the most devastating of cuts- you are on the right track. However, the outlook for our state's children, families and communities is still grim. That's why I am asking you to work with your colleagues to put in place a budget that raises revenue in a fair and smart way. Doing so will help to preserve the vital investments in education, healthcare, and public safety that make North Carolina such a wonderful place. Thank you. Sincerely, Hope Marasco (919) 619-0796

YOU, HOWEVER, TAKE WHAT YOU WANT. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT PRODUCE ANYTHING. IT TAKES FROM THE PRODUCTIVE AND GIVES TO THE VOTERS OF THE PARTY IN POWER. HOW ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT THING? DOES THAT EVER ENTER INTO THE CONVERSATIONS IN RALEIGH? STOP RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION AND START REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE AND YOUR RE-ELECTION WILL BE A FOREGONE CONCLUSION. THERE IS PLENTY OF GOVERNMENT WASTE THAT CAN BE CUT IF YOU HAVE THE GUTS TO DO IT. RAISING TAXES WILL DO NOTHING BUT STIFFLE THE ECONOMY FURTHER. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND READING ANY ECONOMICS 101 BOOK FOR REFERENCE. PERHAPS SOMEONE FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE CAN READ EXCERPTS TO THE LEGLISATURE.

Subject: Budget cuts

Comment: Thank you very much for your support of increased revenue. Part of any increased revenue needs to go to preserve the fabric of services that protect North Carolina's at-risk children. North Carolina needs safe, healthy children who can learn and grow into productive citizens. The current cuts to intervention services for children will destabilize the system and result in the loss of thousands of jobs and over a billion dollars in lost federal Medicaid match money for our state. I am a supervisor/therapist for a team of in home family therapist's who love serving our clients in the rural areas of Lincoln and Cleveland County. My team will not be able to serve as many clients if there is not matched Medicaid funding and there is a high risk that juvenile crime, gang involvement, aggression, and substance abuse will increase if there is no home based services to assist our struggling families. PLease keep in mind that these are the young people that will someday lead our nation and they deserve the right to receive the care they need now to acheive their goals in the future and become healthy and productive citizens in our society. Thank you for your time!

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am really tired of hearing the tired worn out democrat playbook of having to "balance the budget on the backs of (insert liberal constituent group here) whatever". Look, it's simple, start with zero, add emergency services, education and go from there. You can balance the budget by eliminating all of the stupid social welfare spending. Don't expect the taxpayer to continue to fund your liberal guilt via the extortion of tax dollars. The gig is up. Balance the budget with what you have, or quit your job!

Comment: The young children we serve at Alexander and other agenices will not always be young. Cutting funding to Mental Health will not only be an immediate effect, but a long term effect. Some of the long term effects will be crime, domestic violence and gang involvement. I myself was a victim of domestic violence that nearly claimed my life. My thoughts right now are, this did not start as an adult man, these behaviors begin as children and no mental health intervention. My fears if they make the cuts to mental health is for the safety of future children and families, neighbors and co-workers, because it effects us all. Thank You. Sharon Mitchell

Subject: Cut YOUR budget, not mine

Comment: Patricia Davies 3300 Black Horse Run Raleigh, NC 27613-7044 July 5, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: Dear North Carolina legislator, I understand it is hard to write a budget this year because the state is not collecting the taxes it expected. Please do not make it easier on yourself by passing a spend-and-tax budget that makes it harder for my family to make ends meet. Higher taxes would slow our economic recovery and cause more hardships for the 11 percent of people without a job. At a time when the American people are reeling from a bad economy and high unemployment, taxes should NOT be raised. I will never understand this philosophy. In 1991 and 2001, your colleagues and predecessors raised taxes to pay for spending programs taxpayers could no longer afford. As a result, North Carolina now has the twentieth highest tax burden in the country, and one of the highest in the South. We have one of the highest income tax rates in the country, and it starts at a lower level of income than most states. We also have the highest corporate income tax rate in the Southeast. The spending and tax plans presented by Gov. Perdue and Senate Democrats would repeat the pattern with up to $1 per pack more for cigarettes, a 280 percent increase in taxes on other kinds of tobacco, higher taxes on beer and alcohol, higher and more complicated income taxes, higher taxes for businesses, and a new six-percent sales tax on everything I do online, plus home repairs, car repairs, extended warranties, or even a haircut. If I manage to make my mortgage payments to keep my house, even though my federal taxes also pay the mortgage for less responsible borrowers, my reward will be a new six percent tax to keep it in good shape. If I manage to make my car payments, even though my federal taxes also pay for cars I will never see, my reward will be a new six percent tax to keep it running. If I lose my job or health insurance or if my 401(k) has become a 201(k), my taxes still go to pay for the salaries, pensions, and health insurance of state employees who earn more in salary and benefits than people in the private sector. The problem with the budget this year is not that tax revenues are down. The problem is that state spending has grown beyond the means of taxpayers. The General Fund budget grew 34 percent during Gov. Easley's second term while former Speaker Jim Black was taking money in IHOP bathrooms, and the former governor was flying and driving everywhere in free vehicles. Adjusted for inflation, state spending has grown twice as fast as population over the last 25 years. Even after the fall in revenue, the state will collect more in the next fiscal year, again adjusted for population and inflation, than in any year before the dot-com bubble of 1999. I am not alone in my desire that you look for ways to save money and cut spending instead of raising taxes. Recent polls from the Civitas Institute show that 68 percent of people think cuts to existing programs are the best way to balance the budget. And 73 percent think lower taxes are a better way to stimulate the economy than higher government spending. The Federal stimulus money is a band-aid. Please use it to heal the broken state budget, eliminate programs, and not place more burdens on taxpayers. Sincerely, Patricia Davies

Subject: Monies for at risk children

Comment: I appreciate the newness and freshness that you bring to the office of Governor. Thank you for your desire to benefit the state of North Carolina. Also, thank you very much for your support of increased revenue. I would request that part of any increased revenue needs to go to preserve the fabric of services that protect North Carolina's at-risk children. Having had several jobs, both in the private and public sector, that work with at risk sector, their need is high. North Carolina needs safe, healthy children who can learn and grow into productive citizens. The current cuts to intervention services for children will destabilize the system and result in the loss of thousands of jobs and over a billion in lost federal Medicaid match money for our state. I would appreciate your support to funding in this area. Thank you.

Comment: Samantha Lajoie 200 E. Strider St. Apt. 3C Asheboro, NC 27203-3575 July 5, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: It's time to come together. I'm asking you, as one of our state's leaders, to come together with your colleagues, and to agree on a budget that helps North Carolinians through this difficult time and sets us up for future prosperity. To do that, we must raise revenue. Thanks to your leadership and the leadership of your colleagues and predecessors, North Carolina has made wise investments in education, children's healthcare, and family stability. Now is not the time for you to retreat from these investments and others you have championed in the past. I am asking you to take a balanced approach to the budget crisis. The balanced way to address North Carolina's budget shortfall is to make wise spending choices and raise revenue. Sincerely, Samantha Lajoie 3369641099

Subject: Support a Balanced Approach to North Carolina's Budget

Comment: shereen helou 820 Grathwol Drive wilmington, NC 28405-1243 July 6, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: It's time to come together. I'm asking you, as one of our state's leaders, to come together with your colleagues, and to agree on a budget that helps North Carolinians through this difficult time and sets us up for future prosperity. To do that, we must raise a significant amount of new revenue. Thanks to your leadership and the leadership of your colleagues and predecessors, North Carolina has made wise investments in education, children's healthcare, and family stability. Now is not the time for you to retreat from these investments and others you have championed in the past. We thank you for supporting a balanced approach in your first budget by including new revenue that helped to prevent the most devastating of cuts- you are on the right track. However, the outlook for our state's children, families and communities is still grim. That's why I am asking you to work with your colleagues to put in place a budget that raises revenue in a fair and smart way. Doing so will help to preserve the vital investments in education, healthcare, and public safety that make North Carolina such a wonderful place. Thank you. Sincerely, shereen helou
