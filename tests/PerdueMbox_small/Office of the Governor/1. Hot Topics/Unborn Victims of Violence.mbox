Please support the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. I support the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. What is wrong with a state that doesn't recognizes crimes againest the Unborn Child? Every damn thing!!! If your state offers prenatal care to women who other wise couldn't afford it that state is recognizing the right of that child to have health care before birth, so why not justise? Jackie Rodgers

Please support the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. This is by far the dumbest law i have ever heard of!!!!!!! Something needs to  be done! A baby is a human no matter what month week or day he/she is. Weather or not its born should not matter people say having abortions are wrong because its a human no matter what so why should it not count if the child is unborn and murdered?? Unbelievable!!!!! I would be very ahamed if i were u Leaders! God Bless everyone this has happen to!

Please support the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. I am not a resident of North Carolina, but I fully support any law that is for women. I especially support any law for unborn children. These unborn children are victims as well as their mother's & it is unnecissary acts of violence that our country need's to put a stop to & the only way we can is by asking for our lawmaker's to put these law's in effect, so these people who think it is okay to harm us women & unborn children will see there is no playing around. I feel ifa woman who is pregnant get's murdered then that should be 2 counts of murder, not just 1 as it has been. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME EVELYN CHRISTIANSEN

Please support the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. Unborn Victims of Violence will state the following:
AN ACT TO PROVIDE THAT A PERSON WHO commits the crime of murder or manslaughter OF A PREGNANT WOMAN is GUILTY OF A SEPARATE OFFENSE for THE RESULTING DEATH OF THE unborn child and to provide that a person who commits a felony or a misdemeanor that is an act of domestic violence and injures a pregnant woman that results in a miscarriage or stillbirth by the woman is guilty of a separate offense that is punishable at the same class and level as the underlying offense.
