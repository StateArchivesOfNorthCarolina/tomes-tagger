Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing to urge you to oppose Senate Bill 567.

We need energy efficiency, but we need renewable energy too.
Please do not allow this energy efficiency technology to count
as a renewable energy source. We not only need to cut down on
the amount of energy we use, and use the energy we have more
effectively, but we also need our energy to come from cleaner,
renewable sources.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Please oppose Senate Bill 567.

Each month we pay a special surcharge to the electric company
for Green Energy for renewable energy. I do NOT support or want
YOU to support any bill including S567 that allows the utility
corporations to continue to foul up our air, pollute our waters,
or continue to mine and use coal or nuclear energy for producing
power. 

I want our legislature and our state government to become known
for its GREEN ENERGY SOLUTIONS, GREEN ENERGY JOBS, SOLAR POWER
AND WIND PRODUCING POWER AND FOR GREEN MANUFACTURING JOBS! THAT
IS WHAT NC NEEDS!

Two years ago the state legislature passed comprehensive new
goals for renewable energy in North Carolina. But if the
legislature passes Senate Bill 567, our state targets for new
renewable energy generation will be ruined just when clean
energy and green jobs are essential to economic recovery.

Take the POWER away from Progress Energy and Duke Power and give
the POWER to the people with GREEN ENERGY PRODUCTION JOBS, WHERE
IT BELONGS. 

The state can stress energy conservation and stress this to the
people. Show us how and lead the way by example!


Sincerely,

Dear Governor Perdue,

As your constituent, I hope that you will oppose SB 567.

While smart grid energy efficiency technology is a good idea, it
is not a source of renewable energy. If passed as written,
Senate Bill 567 would totally undermine the state's renewable
energy standard.

I cannot believe in this year of major distress that the legislature and governor are considering raising taxes (again).  Where does it stop?  In tough times, we regular folks have to make hard choices  and cut back.  We don’t have some magic “tax” that will help us.  You even tax my unemployment benefits.  Now you are thinking of raising the sales tax by 1% along with an income tax surcharge because (luckily) my husband still has a decent job.  I am not satisfied that all was done to cut back and streamline as much as possible.  It seems to me we elect you people to do what is necessary and make the tough choices, especially now.  Come election time, my vote will be for the “other guy”.  Step up!!
