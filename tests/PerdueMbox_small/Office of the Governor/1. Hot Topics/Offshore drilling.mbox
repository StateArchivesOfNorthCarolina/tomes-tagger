Please reply to mbowenone@bellsouth.net

I am writing to ask you to keep energy prices low and create jobs in the United States by supporting oil and natural gas development in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Americans need a comprehensive domestic energy security plan that includes oil and natural gas exploration at the level needed to ensure affordable energy for American families and businesses.

The Department of Energy estimates that enough oil and natural gas could be recovered safely from deep ocean production in America`s OCS to fuel 65 million cars and heat 63.2 million households for 60 years.

Even as the country focuses on utilizing less carbon-intensive sources of energy, the Department of Energy projects that in 2030 oil and natural gas will be required to meet 55.3 percent of our energy needs.

In an economic environment where jobs are being lost all across the country, domestic energy development will create reliable jobs that provide robust compensation and benefits packages while encouraging manufacturing growth and consumer spending by keeping energy affordable.

I support exploration of oil and natural gas resources from the large, publicly owned reserves off America`s coasts and ask you to ensure a robust offshore leasing program in the OCS 5 Year Plan currently under development.

Sincerely,

Americans need a comprehensive domestic energy security plan that includes oil and natural gas exploration at the level needed to ensure affordable energy for American families and businesses.

The Department of Energy estimates that enough oil and natural gas could be recovered safely from deep ocean production in America`s OCS to fuel 65 million cars and heat 63.2 million households for 60 years.

Even as the country focuses on utilizing less carbon-intensive sources of energy, the Department of Energy projects that in 2030 oil and natural gas will be required to meet 55.3 percent of our energy needs.

In an economic environment where jobs are being lost all across the country, domestic energy development will create reliable jobs that provide robust compensation and benefits packages while encouraging manufacturing growth and consumer spending by keeping energy affordable.

I support exploration of oil and natural gas resources from the large, publicly owned reserves off America`s coasts and ask you to ensure a robust offshore leasing program in the OCS 5 Year Plan currently under development.

Sincerely,

I am writing to ask you to keep energy prices low and create jobs in the United States by supporting oil and natural gas development in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Americans need a comprehensive domestic energy security plan that includes oil and natural gas exploration at the level needed to ensure affordable energy for American families and businesses.

The Department of Energy estimates that enough oil and natural gas could be recovered safely from deep ocean production in America`s OCS to fuel 65 million cars and heat 63.2 million households for 60 years.

Even as the country focuses on utilizing less carbon-intensive sources of energy, the Department of Energy projects that in 2030 oil and natural gas will be required to meet 55.3 percent of our energy needs.

Subject: Off Shore Drilling

Comment: I am reading on line that you have set up a panel to explore off shore drilling. I hope it is so that you can acquire ammunition to fight this horrific proposal. I have only recently moved to North Carolina, but have vacationed on the outer banks for many years. I love the beauty and pristine look of the outer banks and enjoy the fact that it is much less commercial than Virginia Beach or Myrtle Beach. I can go to the outer banks and for a week, I can relax and enjoy the feeling of a simpler time. I would hate to loose that to all that comes with the commercial drilling, not to mention the danger of spoiling everything with one spill. We need to dedicate our energies to developing wind, solar and other renewable energy sources, and leave the oil alone. I fear that starting the off shore drilling process would be opening a Pandoras Box that we will never be able to close. For the sake of the beauty and laid back atmosphere we have on our beaches. Please do not allow off shore drilling.

Subject: Perdue looking for advice on offshore drilling, wind energy

Comment: Honorable Gov. Beverly Perdue, Last year ago I would have been on the side that North Carolina should (PUSH) permits for exploration for oil, natural gas, but we are in a changing time for our world! Other Nations are pushing ahead of the US to find renewable energy to help protect our planet! But with gas prices rising, her Republican opponent, Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory strongly supported allowing drilling off the coast. Gas prices rising, may very be reverse with renewable energy being put into place! As Dick Tracy used his wristwatch as a cell phone back in the 40s, I can see gas station changing to battery exchange stations! Times are changing and we need to change with them! Change will bring both money and jobs to North Carolina! North Carolina can help save the plant as well as save our people money! WE have a great location in North Carolina to install 100s Water Wheels in one place to produce clean energy! We can use the wind (Windmills) to produce clean energy both inland and off its coast. We can use the sun (Solar Panels) to produce clean energy! We can give tax breaks to locate corporation in North Carolina to build the windmills, water wheels, and solar panels! North Carolina can and should support the research in newer renewable energy forms! A new corporation could be formed by business leaders to promote, develop, install renewable energy Plants! I do not have the time or money to start such a corporation. As time passes one day it will cost more to dispose of the nasty oil than it is worth! Time is now for the change!

I looked up Salazar's comments on the midnight attempt of the outgoing Bush administration to hand over even more area to the oil companies without a fair hearing. I'm relieved to know that these attempts are being dealt with. I think the board on off shore resources in NC is a great idea. Now if we could control the coal companies that have been raping our mountains for years, we'd be well on our way to a cleaner, healthier, more beautiful state. Thanks for looking out for us.

I voted for Perdue but I did NOT vote for someone that would put our state at risk of destruction- this includes the coastline and international waters as well. To persue drilling off the coast is a deplorable act and it is not if a spill will happen but when it will happen. The pacific coastline is a migration path for whales, mantas and other pelagics. I am sure you are aware that there are whale watching excursions in Virginia and also here as well. Don't put our state and coast at risk or these non-earth destroying animals as well. I will make it a goal to get the word out and to help stop this madness.

Subject: Yes to Green, No to Hydrocarbons

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue, More drilling off the Outer Banks is the wrong way to solve our energy security, energy supply and economic problems. Even when there aren't catastrophic spills, oil and gas drilling regularly leaks pollutants into our air and water-- harming our beaches and the state's vibrant coastal tourist economy. As you know, the wind resources off the coast of our Outer Banks are among the nation's best. Wind turbines sited responsibly off the coast could create jobs, reduce our oil dependence, and supply pollution-free, homegrown renewable energy to North Carolina. As your new panel deliberates energy resources offshore, I hope it will examine the potentially devastating economic and environmental impacts of drilling along with the potentially ground-breaking impacts of clean, renewable wind power. For more than 20 years, North Carolina leaders have stood up against Big Oil to protect our shores from the threats of oil and gas drilling. More recently, in the Southeast, the state has become a leader in renewable energy. Please do all you can to continue these proud Tar Heel traditions. Sincerely, Cynthea Lee Rose Maiden, NC

Dear Governor Purdue,
NC has estuaries and wetland nurseries unique in the world. Our coasts enjoy visitors from beyond the Americas and are our pride and joy.
How will oil and gas exploration help our fair state? If oil and gas were found, where would the accompanying refineries go?  And all the rest of the mess?
Growing up in TX, I know well the trek along I-10 past Shreveport, down to Houston and beyond. I know of the accompanying devastation and dangers to environment as well as the much quieted facts of accompanying chronic illnesses and deaths to those working in the petroleum industry.
We do not need this one more blight on our fair state.
Thank you very much for rethinking all this.

Comment: Hello Governor Perdue, I hope your trip to China was successful. I was wondering what your stance on offshore oil drilling was. I am currently opposed to any offshore drilling as I don't believe the limited reserves justify the possible environmental threat to the coastline and fishing waters. I know you have set up a panel to investigate alternative energy sources like wind energy and perhaps NC could lead the way in Green Energy? Cheers, Janelle Fleming
