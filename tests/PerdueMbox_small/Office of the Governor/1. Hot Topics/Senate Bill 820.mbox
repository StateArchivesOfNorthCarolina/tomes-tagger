Please support Street Rod and Replica Vehicle Bill (S.B. 820)

S.B. 820 provides specific registration and titling classes for street rods and replicas.

S.B. 820 allows for the use of non-original materials and creates a titling and registration criterion that assigns replica vehicles the same model year designation as the production vehicle intended to be replicated.

S.B. 820 requires that the title of a replica vehicle must clearly indicate that the vehicle is a replica and not an original.

S.B. 820 provides an avenue by which the state can accurately and fairly title and register these specialty vehicles.

S.B. 820 recognizes the immeasurable amount of time, money and attention automotive enthusiasts invest in their hobby cars. Street rods and replicas are the same crowd pleasers that participate in exhibitions and as parade vehicles, and whose owners regularly contribute to charities and civic events. This legislation represents an opportunity to acknowledge this family hobby and to protect it for future generations.

Thank you!

Office of the Governor

Dear Governor,
I was inspired to write after a meeting with associates and friends where the North Carolina S.B. 820
was being discussed. Last nights Senate approval of the House model legislation to create vehicle
registration classification for street rods, replicas and custom vehicles was very well received. The
gentlemen present are all automotive enthusiasts who invest in classic cars out of love for the hobby
and passing down a legacy to their kids and grandkids.

We wish to express our appreciation to elected representatives of  the North Carolina and  to request
your support for S.B. 820 when it arrives at your desk. This bill is an excellent result of negotiations by
lawmakers, hobbyist networks in the state and SEMA and provides specific rules for registration and
titling of street rods & replica vehicles while relieving vehicle owners of inspection concerns and unfair
title branding.


This legislation represents an opportunity to acknowledge and protect  a wonderful family hobby  for
future generations to enjoy. Thank you in advance for adding your signature to enact this bill into law.  


Sincerely,

Bill

Gov Perdue,
   I'm writing to ask you to please consider voting "yes" on S.B. 820. I think this bill will help our car hobby in North Carolina a great deal. Old car enthusiasts normally tend to do a lot for the community, regarding parades, charities etc. This will  help us toward our goal of helping others, and at the same time, maybe help gain the interest of younger kids (and adults), hopefully directing their energy toward something positive, rather than getting in trouble with drugs and other less desirable tendencies. As you are probably aware, the car hobby has always been popular in N.C, and we would like to keep it alive and well for future generations to enjoy. I think S.B. 820 will do a lot of good, both for us (the enthusiasts), and for the state of N.C. Thanks for your time and consideration of this bill.

Honorable Governor;

Soon to come before you is S.B.820 that will be a much needed 'shot in the arm' for all whom participate in the art of custom vehicles and historical preservation. Given the constant negative news about the economy and results that it brings, a piece of  'good news' for tar heals would go a long way towards lifting the moral of us all and help maintain and provide employment to those who have dedicated some much of their life's work on creating crowd pleasing vehicular works of art for so many public events in this State.

I respectfully request that you sign S.B.820 into law for the benefit of all who build, restore or just simply enjoy viewing a piece of American history and North Carolina craftsmanship.


Thank you for taking the time to read this e-mail.

Sincerely,

A. Bryson

Dear Governor Purdue,

I respectfully urge you to support SB 820 relative to a vehicle 
registration classification for streets rods, replicas and custom 
vehicles.  This hobby industry provides tax dollars to the state from 
multiple avenues.  As an individual consumer, the time and money auto 
enthusiasts spend can't be ignored.  It is a family hobby, and car 
enthusiasts beget car enthusiasts; you are protecting the future.  They 
participate in community organizations, parades, exhibits, rarely a 
weekend passes that any region doesn't have some type of fundraiser 
benefiting a charitable organization.  As an employer, the majority of 
car hobby-related businesses are privately-owned and operated, often 
initiating new businesses when the labor market is looking bleak.  When 
families are pinched and can't afford an out-of-town vacation, the hobby 
provides a less expensive alternative and diversion. Supporting this 
bill is the right thing to do.

Again, I respectfully ask that you sign this bill and enact SB 820 into law.

Governor:



I am a small business owner in the State of North Carolina and I am requesting you sign and support SB 820. 



As you are aware North Carolina is the second largest state for antique/classic cars (1973 & older registrations) in the US.  While not perfect, the proposed SB-820 will make great strides bringing closure to areas of confusion between hobbyists, collectors, businesses such as mine and DMV Theft and Enforcement.  I urge you to sign this very important piece of legislation as soon as possible.  In fact, I would invite you to visit my place of business as a way of commemorating the passage of this legislation.



The State of North Carolina has tremendous opportunity to grow the restoration segment of the automobile aftermarket through many other programs and incentives.  If I can be of further assistance or offer additional information please have a staff member contact me.



Sincerely,

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am a member of Street-Tiques of Asheville hot rod club and an owner of two street-legal, fully operable vintage trucks ('42 Chevy & '47 GMC). I am writing to ask you to sign into law SB 820 for the following reasons:

* S.B. 820 provides specific registration and titling classes for street rods and replicas.

* S.B. 820 allows for the use of non-original materials and creates a titling and registration criterion that assigns replica vehicles the same model year designation as the production vehicle intended to be replicated.

Greetings Gov. Perdue,
   I will keep this short, as you appear to be a VERY busy lady. Thank you for working so hard for our great state. I wrote to ask that when it gets to your desk, that you please sign S.B. 820 into law. This bill will greatly streamline the process of getting a legal title for street rods and custom cars through our NCDMV. It should save the folks at NCDMV a lot of time in processing a title for said vehicles, and we all know that time equals money. There are a great many businesses in NC that support the street rodding and old car hobby. Signing this bill into law should help those businesses grow, and in turn help our states economy. Thank you for all that you do for the great state on North Carolina.
                                                                        Sincerely,

Dear Governor Perdue,

S.B. 820 will soon come to you for your signature. This bill creates a specific registration and title class for custom vehicles, replicas and street rods. Along with many other car enthusiasts, I value the car hobby as it has provided the opportunity to meet new people, spend time with friends and given my family a common interest.



Given all that is happening at the federal and state levels, I believe S.B. 820 protects the car hobby for the people of North Carolina. I urge your support of S.B. 820.  Thank you.



Sincerely,



Gary McClune

Dear Governor Bev Perdue,

We have been street rod owner enthusiasts for over 20 years.  We built our first street rod in our garage over a 4 year period as time and money allowed.  We are very proud of that accomplishment and the great leisure time it affords us still today.  We are so very pleased with the possibility of S.B. 820 being enacted into law to protect and preserve the history and integrity of the hobby we so enjoy along with thousands of other North Carolinians.  We hope you have been able to see the excitement on the face of a child who watches an "old car" pass by in a parade.  We respectfully request your support of S. B. 820.

Sincerely,
Dale & Ann Buckner

As an automotive enthusiast, I urge you to sign into law S.B. 820 which creates a vehicle registration classification for street rods, replicas and custom vehicles.  S.B. 820 recognizes the immeasurable amount of time, money and attention automotive enthusiasts invest in their hobby cars.  Street rods and replicas are the same crowd pleasers that participate in exhibitions and as parade vehicles, and whose owners regularly contribute to charities and civic events.  This legislation represents an opportunity to acknowledge this family hobby and to protect it for future generations.

Dear Governor Perdue,

     I respectfully request that you put your support behind S.B. 820.    I realize in today's circumstances you have many pressing

matters but I hope you will give this item consideration.     The collection, restoration and building of special interest cars probably

has more of an effect on North Carolina's economy than most people would suspect.     It is also one of the few hobbies that still

enjoy's "Family" participation.     Thank you for your service to the State of North Carolina !!


Best Wishes,

Dear Gov. Perdue,

 please SUPPORT and sign S.B. 820 which provides specific registration and titling classes for street rods and replicas.
- S.B. 820 allows for the use of non-original materials and creates a titling and registration criterion that assigns replica vehicles the same model year designation as the production vehicle intended to be replicated.
- S.B. 820 requires that the title of a replica vehicle must clearly indicate that the vehicle is a replica and not an original.
- S.B. 820 provides an avenue by which the state can accurately and fairly title and register these specialty vehicles.
- S.B. 820 recognizes the immeasurable amount of time, money and attention automotive enthusiasts invest in their hobby cars.  Street rods and replicas are the same crowd pleasers that participate in exhibitions and as parade vehicles, and whose owners regularly contribute to charities and civic events.  This legislation represents an opportunity to acknowledge this family hobby and to protect it for future generations. 
- S.B. 820 will also reduce the overly burdensome, needlessly complex and time consuming DOT processes now in place.

I respectfully urge you to sign S.B. 820.  

Sincerely,
Rex Bartles
