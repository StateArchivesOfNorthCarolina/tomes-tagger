> Comment: Governor Purdue, The following letter was sent as a copy to Gov. Mike Easley concerning the Monroe Bypass and Gaston East/West Connector. To date, Stallings Elementary School is constructed and within a few hundred feet of a proposed intersection (One of two options)of the Monroe Bypass. I really did not receive an adequate response from the NCTA concerning this matter. I have other scientific research articles I can share with you, if you are interested. I am concerned for the health of the children attending this school if they construct the Highway within close proximity to the school. Thank You Ed Eason Ms. Jennifer Harris, P.E. November 12, 2007 North Carolina Turnpike Authority Re: Monroe Connector/Bypass & the Gaston East-West Connector I have some questions and comments concerning the air quality impacts with the proposed Monroe Bypass/Connector and the Gaston East-West Connector. Please answer these questions and add these comments to the public record. 1. I understand that Union and Mecklenburg Counties are currently in attainment for PM2.5, but to my knowledge, Union has no monitor for PM2.5 while Mecklenburg’s annual standard is currently 14.9µg/m3. I believe you mentioned the annual standard for non-attainment is 15.0µg/m3 and above. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) projects that the trucking industry will be responsible for a 75 % increase in freight tonnage by 2020, and the proposed intermodal facility at the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport and expansions at the ports will substantially increase truck traffic on the proposed freeways. As a result, the diesel particulate matter and exhaust organic gases will be closer to existing and already planned homes and schools, etc. (sensitive receptors). Why are the FHWA and NCTA not conducting a computer model assessment for PM2.5 and diesel organic gases? Citizens have a right to know if the additional traffic will increase these pollutants at the project level and for probable non-attainment for PM2.5 in the future. The Gauderman et al study in the journal Lancet found that elevated PM2.5 levels were found up to 1500 feet from major roadways. 2. The Federal Highway Administration’s interim guidance on Mobile Source Air Toxics is highly suppositious, based primarily on surmise rather than adequate scientific evidence. If known human health hazard prevention were a priority, the same unknowns the FHWA points out quite nicely in their prepared Environmental Impact Statements as to why they cannot do a comprehensive MSATs (Mobile Source Air Toxins) analysis at the project level in order to quantify the cancer and non-cancer risks should be enough reason to avoid schools and residential areas altogether. The EPA found that a substantial number of modeling assessment and air quality monitoring studies show elevated concentrations of multiple (MSATs) in close proximity to major roads. The 6 priority MSATs out of a total of 177 are: Acetaldehyde, Acrolein, Benzene,1,3-Butadiene, Diesel Particulate Matter & Diesel Exhaust Organic Gases, and Formaldehyde. I understand that there will be a proposed 30% reduction in MSATs from 40 CFR parts 59, 80, 85, and 86 due to cleaner fuels and vehicles by 2030. While this action by the EPA is applauded, the results will not be immediately realized in 2015 due to the expected delay for a complete fuel program phase-in and the immediate purchase of all new clean vehicles is unlikely, which means most of the projected reductions will probably occur closer to 2030. Let’s assume the reductions of gasoline (on-road mobile sources) will be met (a total of 371 million pounds in 2020 and 606 million pounds of MSATs in 2030 reduced); there will still be 558,666 tons in 2015, and 507,782 tons in 2020 and 505,074 tons of MSATs in 2030 emitted to the atmosphere in the US on a yearly basis according to the EPA. This equates to over one billion pounds of on-road MSATs per year still emitted to the atmosphere. The EPA should set a minimum standard for at least the 6 priority MSATs, and they should be included in the transportation conformity process under Title 40 CFR part 51 and 93. Other than pointing out the accomplishments and deficiencies of the EPA, what actions if any are the FHWA and the NCTA going to take to reduce the exposure to citizens who live within close proximity to the proposed freeways? Will the NCTA purchase a 2300 foot total right of way? Will the FHWA, and by extension the NCTA, just continue to use 40 CFR 1502.22 a&b to opt out of doing a proper comprehensive risk assessment that will inform citizens of the risk and allow for sound decisions whether to move forward with a proposed highway in a specific area or not? 3. Comparing the impact of MSATs against different options (Existing Highway 74) within the study area is analogous to not seeing the forest for the trees, and this approach does not give an accurate representation to the impact on sensitive receptors at the project level. After you construct the new freeway, then you will have two major roadways with cumulative pollutants, and the new highway will be close to where large numbers of people reside. The comparison needs to be with the background ambient concentrations from actual monitors along the entire length of the proposed freeway(s). If monitors are not in place, they could easily be installed in the planning stage of the proposed freeway. When will the FHWA & NCTA contract to install monitors for PM2.5 and MSATs to accurately measure the background ambient concentrations for Options 18A, 21, 22A, 30, 34 etc.? Isn’t there 2 years until construction starts and 4 years thereafter until completion? Just in the area that includes Options 18A, 21, and 22A, there are approximately 23 residential subdivisions, and Lake Park has 781 housing units while Fairhaven will have approximately 400. NCTA indicated that Segment 5 was eliminated due to substantial potential impacts to the human environment and has a total of only 697 housing units. Segments 18A, 21, 22A, 30, and 34, etc. also are densely populated, but they do not have substantial impacts to business. Was minimizing the negative impact to businesses a priority for the NCTA in the screening process? The Alternatives Development and Analysis report failed to mention the number of housing units for the other subdivisions for segments 18A, 21, 22A, 30, & 34 etc. A thorough comprehensive analysis of the air quality impacts involving MSATs, PM2.5 and ozone formation to these residential areas must be conducted in order to determine the environmental constraints to comply with Federal and State statues including the NC Intrastate system. The State statute that prevents an existing roadway (Highway 74) to be tolled especially in an urban area should be reconsidered. Please address the probable congestion at the proposed interchanges at Sections 18A, 21, 22A & 30 that will occur due to existing inadequate roads, especially near Stallings Elementary School where parents will be dropping and picking up their children. According to the Gauderman et al study in the journal Lancet: “We have shown that residential distance from a freeway is associated with significant deficits in 8-year respiratory growth, which result in important deficits in lung function at age 18 years. This study adds to evidence that the present regulatory emphasis on regional air quality might need to be modified to include consideration of local variation in air pollution. In many urban areas, population growth is forcing the construction of housing tracts and schools near busy roadways (and vice versa), with the result that many children live and attend school in close proximity to major sources of air pollution. In view of the magnitude of the reported effects and the importance of lung function as a determinant of adult morbidity and mortality, reduction of exposure to traffic-related air pollutants could lead to substantial public-health benefits.” Please also explain in the DEIS how the MSATs, PM2.5 and other pollutants will not affect children at school. Obviously, the subdivisions between the existing 485 and option 18A are going to be impacted by both major freeways, and any DEIS will need to conduct an air quality modeling assessment to determine MSATs exposure levels as well. The FHWA can receive guidance from the EPA on monitoring, computer modeling, and pollutant exposure levels while the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry can provide Public Health consultations and assessments. 4. The latest assessment by the EPA estimates the excess risk of developing leukemia from inhalation exposure to benzene is as low as 2.2 to 7.8 x 10-6µg/m3. According to the National Cancer Institute, US National Institutes of Health, the estimated cases for 2007 are 44,240 new cases of leukemia resulting in 21,790 deaths. 78% of children get Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL). According to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, approximately 218,659 people in the US currently are living with leukemia, and it causes more deaths than any other cancer among children under age 20. About 515 children under the age of 14 are expected to die from leukemia in 2007. Can anyone tell me how many of these unfortunate deaths are attributable to being exposed to benzene within close proximity to a major roadway? The EPA states: “Several studies have measured elevated concentrations of pollutants emitted directly by motor vehicles near roadways as compared to overall urban background levels. Pollutants measured with elevated concentrations include benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, black carbon, and coarse, fine, and ultra fine particulate matter. As described above, benzene and 1,3-butadiene are both known human leukemogens in adults. Evidence of adverse responses to traffic-related pollution is strongest for non-allergic respiratory symptoms, cardiovascular effects, premature adult mortality, and adverse birth outcomes, including low birth weight and size. Some evidence for new onset asthma is available, but not all studies have significant correlations. As previously mentioned, there is evidence of increased risk of leukemia among children whose parents have been occupationally exposed to benzene. Though the near-roadway studies are equivocal, taken together with the laboratory studies and other exposure environments, the data suggest a potentially serious children’s health concern could exist. Additional research is needed to determine the significance.” Most research for the effects of benzene has only been conducted on adults, and little is known of the effects on children.

Montgomery County currently has an unemployment rate of over 10%.

The town of Troy does not need to buy a golf course to expand a walking trail or to protect Densons Creek.( Another thing Troy lets its run off from their Sewer go into this very Creek, so as you can see they really care about Densons Creek ) In addition to the purchase of the course, an additional one(1) million dollars will be used to irrigate the course and run water and sewer where the town sees fit. Note the Densons Creek surrounds the golf course. Look for editorials in the Montgomery Herald and The Post, starting Wednesday, January 28, 2009 for information regarding the town's purchase of the golf course.

Dear Ms. Caddell,
Thank you for your email of January 27 regarding use of grant funding in Montgomery County.

The Clean Water Management Trust Fund was created by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1996 to help restore degraded waters, protect unpolluted waters, and/or contribute toward a network of riparian buffers and greenways for environmental, educational, and recreational benefits. Since it’s creation, it has helped small towns and communities such as Troy and economically distressed counties like Montgomery keep their water supplies clean and safe.

CWMTF awarded two grants totaling $1.5 million to the Town of Troy to help reduce the amount of treated wastewater discharged into Badin Lake and Denson’s Creek in order to improve the water quality in both waterways.  The grants assisted the town in its effort to purchase the golf course at a bargain price as a way to protect the creek directly by establishing 30 to 50 feet of buffer zone around it.  The project added a mile to the town’s existing greenway system, providing residents with increased recreational opportunities while protecting water quality at the same time.  This initiative also received approximately $500,000 from the North Carolina Parks and Recreation Trust Fund.

In addition, the CWMTF funds assisted Troy in designing a plan to use the golf course itself to help reduce the amount of treated wastewater discharged into the lake and creek by using it for irrigation.  The town is has submitted a grant request in the 2009 CWMTF funding cycle for $1.4 million to actually construct the lines needed to carry the treated wastewater to the golf course, thereby reducing the amount of discharge into Denson’s Creek by 87 percent.  CWMTF’s Board of Trustees will review  that request later this year.

In total, CWMTF has awarded nine grants to the Town of Troy totaling $3.5 million dollars to protect water quality for its citizens.  Without clean water, the health and welfare of all of Montgomery County would be threatened.  Without clean water, there would be little economic incentive for business and industry in Montgomery County.  CWMTF has a legislative mandate to focus its grant resources in Tier One Economically Distressed Counties such as Montgomery and therefore the eight year working relationship CWMTF has with the Town of Troy represents a considerable effort to provide much needed assistance to one of the many areas of our state feeling the effects of our changing economy.

Again, thank you for expressing your concern.

Dear Mr. David:

Thank you for your recent correspondence. The governor's office has asked that I respond to your e-mail.

I have learned that the bid process you are describing was being overseen by the state’s Ecosystem Enhancement Program as an effort to control invasive species on an important urban stream-restoration project in Durham’s Forest Hills Park.  The control of invasive species in the project is crucial to protecting North Carolina’s investment in water-quality improvement for the city of Durham’s Third Fork Creek and the Cape  Fear River basin.

The bid process for the contract in question, one of hundreds of EEP projects that DENR has outsourced to the private sector in the past six years, was conducted under procedures outlined in the State Construction Manual (<http://www.nc-sco.com/Manual/Chapter400%20-%20Bidding%20and%20Contracts.pdf>http://www.nc-sco.com/Manual/Chapter400%20-%20Bidding%20and%20Contracts.pdf).  The three representatives you identified from EEP were the site’s project manager, EEP’s design/construction supervisor and a water-resources engineer who focuses on the long-term monitoring of the project.  It is important to point out that the Forest Hills Park work is a pilot project for EEP's approach to dealing with invasive-plant removal statewide in its stream- and wetland-restoration projects, and all of the EEP staff on hand for this bid opening will be involved in similar efforts across the state.

While I regret that you were not pleased with the results of the bidding process, please be assured that normal procedures were followed and that the contract was awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, Invasive Plant Control Inc.  The company is based in Tennessee, but the work was performed by an employee who lives in the Triangle area.  The work was completed on time, for the bid price and to the satisfaction of EEP.

I hope this information clarifies this situation.

Sincerely,

Diana Kees, Communications Director

Subject: a super wasteful agency

Comment: Last year, I was solicited by DENR to bid on a project for killing off undesirable plants in a wetland restoration project. On a cold March Day, we (three bidders) met with three DENR engineers and a city engineer who collectively explained the entire project. On bid opening day, I was the only one of the three bidders at bid opening. Mine was opened first, then the other two. Mine was the highest bid and of course, I did not get the job. To end the opening, I was asked by the project manager "Do you have any questions? I said "I do--How many overseers does it take to accomplish this simple mission? There was silence followed by "What exactly do you mean?" I continued "According to what I've heard and interpreted, DENR has assigned three well paid engineers to oversee a simple project. Next, you will award the job to the lowest bidder who will do the absolute minimum to get 90% of the contracted for monies. Since he is from out-of-state, I doubt that he and his company will return to finish the job and collect the other 10%. In other words, this is a game. I've found out what the rate is per acre, so if I want to win a state bid, then I have to acquiesce to that rate, do a half-ass job, get 90% of my contracted for pay then don't return to finish the job to get the last 10%." After a long silence, I continued, "I understand the game but what really makes me angry is that the state of N. C. is being robbed blind with way over the top, supervision or whatever you want to call it with high salaried people like yourselves when someone with an associates degree and some certifications can do as good or better a job! So here I am, in a room with people who not only don't have pesticide/herbicide certifications but they don't even have a clue about the plant life on the list of plants to be killed off! There's something seriously wrong with that picture and I would like to hear a response from the governor. I would guarantee Gov. Perdue that if she went up there to Capital Blvd. and fired half the people in that gargantuan building then told the other half to get off their butts and get to work, she would save N. C. a ton of money and get a whole lot more out of that agency than they're currently producing. Lastly, I have a good friend who works there that when I ask him what he does, he really can't come up with much. He has a Masters and is going back to N. C. State again to get yet another degree so he can siphon more money out of the state coffers. I give him a hard time at every opportunity about the agencies lack of effectiveness and he just laughs about it, even when I tell him that I'm serious. Sincerely, Chris David

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith,

Gov. Perdue asked me to respond to your recent email regarding sandbags
on your property in Ocean Isle Beach. I was not able to find a permit
for sandbags in your name, but possibly you are a homeowner in the Sand
Dwellers condominiums, which do have sandbags. If that’s the case, then
the sandbags in front of your home are in place legally, and are allowed
to be in place for five years from the time of permit issuance. If they
were placed last year, then you have considerable time left on the permit.

The sandbags that the CRC is requiring to be removed are those that have
been in place for a number of years, following a CRC rule that allowed
property owners in communities making headway toward beach nourishment
to keep their sandbags for five years from the date of installation or
until May 2008. This allowed many sandbag structures to remain in place
for 10 years or more, much longer than is normally allowed. The
Commission has not chosen to extend the time sandbags may remain any
longer.
However, it does not appear that your sandbags fall under this category,
so I do not understand why you feel the Division is requiring their
removal at this time.

The CRC understands that coastal property owners want to protect their
homes from erosion. The sandbag rules were written to allow property
owners to temporarily protect imminently threatened oceanfront
structures. However, the CRC also must protect access to public beaches.
Its rules attempt to strike a balance between a homeowner’s desire to
protect private property and the public’s right to use our state’s
beaches. Sandbags are intended to provide */temporary/*/ /protection to
imminently threatened structures while their owners seek more permanent
solutions, such as beach nourishment or relocation of the structure. The
CRC never intended for sandbags to be used as a permanent protective
measure.

If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Govenor Perdue we who live at the coast desperately need your help to
perserve our homes. We live at Ocean Isle Beach and our sand bags are
the only thing that keeps the ocean from taking our street and home.
These sand bags were just put in place last summer and the CRC is trying
to have them removed. The town of Ocean Isle Beach supports us in this
effort and they are doing all they can to help us save our homes. Our
state, and Orgeon are the only states now that will not allow permantent
structures to contain the ocean.



Please, please help us.

Dear Ms. Shoemaker,

Gov. Perdue asked me to respond to your recent email regarding sandbags
on your neighbor’s property in Nags Head. I gather from your letter that
your neighbor has received a notice that the sandbags in front of their
property must be removed.

The sandbags that the Coastal Resources Commission and DCM are requiring
to be removed are those that have been in place for a number of years,
following a CRC rule that allowed property owners in communities making
headway toward beach nourishment to keep their sandbags for five years
from the date of installation or until May 2008, whichever was later.
This allowed many sandbag structures to remain in place for 10 years or
more, much longer than is normally allowed. The Commission has not
chosen to extend the time sandbags may remain any longer.

I would like to stress that the Commission has not outlawed sandbags on
the coast; we are still writing permits for new sandbag structures.
However, those structures that have been in place for an extended time
must now be removed as they no longer have valid CAMA permits.

The CRC understands that coastal property owners want to protect their
homes from erosion. The sandbag rules were written to allow property
owners to temporarily protect imminently threatened oceanfront
structures. However, the CRC also must protect access to public beaches.
Its rules attempt to strike a balance between a homeowner’s desire to
protect private property and the public’s right to use our state’s
beaches. Sandbags are intended to provide */temporary/*/ /protection to
imminently threatened structures while their owners seek more permanent
solutions, such as beach nourishment or relocation of the structure. The
CRC never intended for sandbags to be used as a permanent protective
measure.

If your neighbor has received a notice to remove the sandbag structure,
he does have the option to file for a variance from the CRC, requesting
additional time for the sandbags. Instructions for doing so are
available on DCM’s web site:
http://www.nccoastalmanagement.net/Permits/forms.htm.

If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
Jim Gregson

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am a semi-oceanfront land owner in south Nags Head, NC. I assisted my
oceanfront neighbor, paying for $25,000 worth of his sandbagging, which
ultimately would help preserve my home as well.

I do not understand the philosophy of the State whereby one year it
allows and approves of sandbags, willingly accepting fees associated
with such actions, then a few years later, does a 180 degree “about
face” and now prohibits them.

I ask, respectfully, if you can answer this question. I also would ask
you if you’d like to purchase my home for $800,000 after the sandbags
are removed?

Respectfully submitted,

permit.

The sandbags that the CRC is requiring to be removed are those that 
have 
been in place for a number of years, following a CRC rule that 
allowed 
property owners in communities making headway toward beach 
nourishment 
to keep their sandbags for five years from the date of installation 
or 
until May 2008. This allowed many sandbag structures to remain in 
place 
for 10 years or more, much longer than is normally allowed. The 
Commission has not chosen to extend the time sandbags may remain any 
longer.
However, it does not appear that your sandbags fall under this 
category, 
so I do not understand why you feel the Division is requiring their 
removal at this time.

The CRC understands that coastal property owners want to protect 
their 
homes from erosion. The sandbag rules were written to allow property 
owners to temporarily protect imminently threatened oceanfront 
structures. However, the CRC also must protect access to public 
beaches. 
Its rules attempt to strike a balance between a homeownerâ€™s desire to 
protect private property and the publicâ€™s right to use our stateâ€™s 
beaches. Sandbags are intended to provide */temporary/*/ /protection 
to 
imminently threatened structures while their owners seek more 
permanent 
solutions, such as beach nourishment or relocation of the structure. 
The 
CRC never intended for sandbags to be used as a permanent protective 
measure.

If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Subject: Removal of Sand Bags on Ocean Front Properties



Govenor Perdue we who live at the coast desperately need your help to 
perserve our homes. We live at Ocean Isle Beach and our sand bags are 
the only thing that keeps the ocean from taking our street and home. 
These sand bags were just put in place last summer and the CRC is 
trying 
to have them removed. The town of Ocean Isle Beach supports us in 
this 
effort and they are doing all they can to help us save our homes. Our 
state, and Orgeon are the only states now that will not allow 
permantent 
structures to contain the ocean.



Please, please help us.



James D. and Wilma Smith

Dear Mr. Sansotta,

Your recent emails to Governor Perdue's office regarding the sandbags on your properties in Nags Head were referred to the Dept. of Environment and Natural Resources. The Division of Coastal Management anticipates addressing these issues through the legal proceedings you have pending before the Coastal Resources Commission.

Sincerely,
Michele Walker

Dear Governor,



My name is Roc Sansotta. I have houses on Seagull Drive since 1988.  I have never asked the town or state or county for a penny to protect these houses.  My interest is to protect my investment.  When I bought these houses I was told the sandbags were for my protection.  As I signed to buy a Nor’easter hit and I lost 15 feet of driveway and didn’t know what I had gotten myself into. Now the CRC and CAMA has ordered me to take the sandbags out !!!!



It has been a constant struggle keeping these houses rentable. These houses all bring in money to the state, county and town.  I wonder why I can’t be left alone.  There are around 150 other homeowners in the same position.  Two people in the middle of my street have a $275,000 and a $300,000 mortgages and most others have large mortgages as well.  The only answer the town has given us is to give the town the houses and then pay $27,000 for them to be torn down.  I am sure neither the commissioners nor the Mayor would do this why would you ask the public to do this?



Flood insurance pays only if the house falls into the ocean.  My houses are fully booked for the entire season.  I reiterate that this is a lot of property tax and sales tax money that would go to the state, county and town.  Why would you not want to receive this money with the economy as it is now? 



Kaiser Chaffon was in this situation a few years ago with a $175,000 mortgage. He wasn’t allowed to repair his sandbags and it wiped out his septic tank.  The town then condemned his house and it was not allowed to become operational.  The town tore it down and put a judgment against him for $27,000+.  Then the bank put a judgment against him for his $175,000 mortgage and put a hold on all of his checking accounts in North Carolina , New Jersey , Arizona , etc.  A lien was put against all his properties instate and out of state.  This effectively ruined him because he wasn’t allowed to protect his property with sandbags



Bob Whetstine had his bags removed because of fear of a similar letter and it wiped out his septic tank. The town ordered his house to be torn down.  He succumbed to the request and then had to pay many thousands of dollars for it to be torn down.  He lost the house and the income from it.   His actions started a devastating chain of events on Nansemond Street .  After the first storm the house behind his became condemned as well as the house north of his house and the house behind that one.  The house north of that one was condemned as well.  Also the house south of his house and the house behind that house became condemned.  To this date all those houses are still condemned.



If  I pull my sandbags protecting my houses on Seagull Drive , the road will be washed out, the town’s water lines broken and the houses behind will become condemned after the first storm hits.  This will cause an out of control wildfire that will cost much needed revenue to the owners of these houses also to the state the county and the town. Let us keep and repair sandbags until we get beach nourishment.

Diana, can you respond to this person?  An e-mail from <mailto:02vikings@charter.net>02vikings@charter.net somehow went to DHHS.  (We do not have an information other than that.)  Obviously, they cannot answer questions about the hiring freeze relative to DENR.  Also, I don't think there's any way to know how long the hiring freeze will be in effect.  Surely, it depends on the recession and how long it lasts.

Thanks.
A.

I have contacted them and they have no information. Bev Perdue put the freeze on so she should know. This is not the way business should be conducted. I was never informed these positions were on hold I found out through people who work with the NC Forest Service. I need to know what is going on. Thanks.

A user with email address of 02vikings@charter.net submitted the following question.



                       I would like to know when the NC Forest Service hiring freeze on Assistant County Ranger positions are coming off. I recently graduated with my Associates degree and have been to 3 interviews and it has been nearly 4 months. I am currently layed off and would like to know if I have even been chosen for any of these positions. After 90 days these positions have to be re posted and that is more time I do not have. I would greatly apprecitate an answer. Thanks for your time.
