Members of the General Assembly and the Honorable Governor Bev Perdue
State Capitol Building
Raleigh, NC 27699-0301

Subject:† I Oppose the Sales/Use Tax Nexus bill

Dear Members and Governor Perdue:

My business has already been devastated by the sales/use tax nexus bill. I am being discriminated against because I partially make my living by selling advertising on my website.

My income and my life has, like many others, been heavily impacted by the economic issues facing both the nation and North Carolina. As a result, I am now working 3 jobs, and had started using internet advertising as an affiliate to help supplement my income so that I can survive. Because of this bill, this is now gone and I must find another way to survive.

I am an internet marketing specialist and have studied and worked with the internet for 16 years. I provide website design, internet marketing consulting and services to my clients. I run a several websites that used to gather income by serving advertising for a select group of companies who provide affiliate programs. Since the passage of this law, nearly all of them have severed their relationship with me. I expect the rest to follow shortly now that the bill has been passed. So, North Carolina will lose the potential sales tax revenue from those companies, and will also lose the income tax I would have paid from the revenues I expected to make.

I am having a great deal of difficulty in seeing how this will help North Carolina. Indeed, I cannot but see that this will have a negative impact on both sales and income tax collections, as well as promoting North Carolina as a poor place to do business. Large companies such as Amazon.com, Overstock.com, Clickbank and Commission Junction are planning to or have already severed their relationships with their North Carolina affiliates, thereby both eliminating any chance that North Carolina can collect sales taxes, and also reducing the income of *every* person who earned money via affiliate advertising, and thereby reducing income taxes collected from said individuals. Any company that does online sales will now take measures to avoid doing business with *anyone* located in North Carolina as a ëremote advertising locationí, and the internet entrepreneurs who are part of the strong base of the nationís economy are being penalized for attempting to succeed.

I expect this measure will cost North Carolina hundreds of millions in lost income from both potential sales taxes and lost income taxes because of reduced income from the former affiliate marketers.

In the end, the net result is lost revenues for North Carolina. Certainly that wasnít the intent of this bill?

This law will be futile: my partners have severed their advertising relationships with me; my income is devastated and North Carolina will not collect the sales tax it sought to force from the retailers. They just refused to continue doing business here. Please tell me how North Carolina (or anyone) will benefit?

I respectfully ask you to remove the sales/use tax nexus clause from the budget bill.

Sincerely,

Vicky Rowe

Subject: You must read

Comment: Politicians are the only people in the world who create problems and then campaign against them. Have you ever wondered, if both the Democrats and the Republicans are against deficits, WHY do we have deficits? Have you ever wondered, if all the politicians are against inflation and high taxes, WHY do we have inflation and high taxes? You and I don't propose a federal budget. The president does. You and I don't have the Constitutional authority to vote on appropriations. The House of Representatives does. You and I don't write the tax code, Congress does. You and I don't set fiscal policy, Congress does. You and I don't control monetary policy, the Federal Reserve Bank does. One hundred senators, 435 congressmen, one president, and nine Supreme Court justices equates to 545 human beings out of the 300 million are directly, legally, morally, and individually responsible for the domestic problems that plague this country. I excluded the members of the Federal Reserve Board because that problem was created by the Congress. In 1913, Congress delegated its Constitutional duty to provide a sound currency to a federally chartered, but private, central bank. I excluded all the special interests and lobbyists for a sound reason.. They have no legal authority. They have no ability to coerce a senator, a congressman, or a president to do one cotton-picking thing. I don't care if they offer a politician $1 million dollars in cash. The politician has the power to accept or reject it. No matter what the lobbyist promises, it is the legislator's responsibility to determine how he votes. Those 545 human beings spend much of their energy convincing you that what they did is not their fault. They cooperate in this common con regardless of party. What separates a politician from a normal human being is an excessive amount of gall. No normal human being would have the gall of a Speaker, who stood up and criticized the President for creating deficits... The president can only propose a budget. He cannot force the Congress to accept it. The Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land, gives sole responsibility to the House of Representatives for originating and approving appropriations and taxes. Who is the speaker of the House? Nancy Pelosi. She is the leader of the majority party. She and fellow House members, not the president, can approve any budget they want. If the president vetoes it, they can pass it over his veto if they agree to. It seems inconceivable to me that a nation of 300 million can not replace 545 people who stand convicted -- by present facts -- of incompetence and irresponsibility. I can't think of a single domestic problem that is not traceable directly to those 545 people. When you fully grasp the plain truth that 545 people exercise the power of the federal government, then it must follow that what exists is what they want to exist. If the tax code is unfair, it's because they want it unfair. If the budget is in the red, it's because they want it in the red .. If the Army & Marines are in IRAQ , it's because they want them in IRAQ If they do not receive social security but are on an elite retirement plan not available to the people, it's because they want it that way. There are no insoluble government problems. Do not let these 545 people shift the blame to bureaucrats, whom they hire and whose jobs they can abolish; to lobbyists, whose gifts and advice they can reject; to regulators, to whom they give the power to regulate and from whom they can take this power. Above all, do not let them con you into the belief that there exists disembodied mystical forces like "the economy," "inflation," or "politics" that prevent them from doing what they take an oath to do. Those 545 people, and they alone, are responsible. They, and they alone, have the power. They, and they alone, should be held accountable by the people who are their bosses. Provided the voters have the gumption to manage their own employees. We should vote all of them out of office and clean up their mess!

Comment: Dear Ms. Governor, What on earth are you thinking? It is beyond me that you would consider raising the sales tax a WHOLE percent in these economic times. I am a small retailer and, even tough you seem to think the economy is turning for the better, I am losing customers every day. Why would you want to put one more nail in our coffin? EVERYONE needs to tighten their belts to get through this, but punishing my customers is not acceptable. We are the employers, we are the tax base. Do the right thing and make a MODEST raise in the sales tax, not a whole percentage point! I wish you were as tough on crime as you seem to be on independent retailers.

Dear Madam.
I encourage you in the strongest possible terms to VETO any optional 
sales tax bill that the legislature sends to your desk.  The timing is 
terrible, and with the additional sales tax that has already been 
levied on the citizens of the state, another tax is going way to far.  
I know we can count on you to do the right thing and VETO any such 
bill.

Dear office of the Governor Beverly Perdue,
†† Thank you so much for your lovely response but lets just cut to the chase here,† you and I and everyone else in NC know you can cut spending on the rediculous crap you choose to waste our tax dollars on and in the end have plenty of money for education.† Lets start with that land in the mountains of NC,† now sorry but we dont need it,† then lets continue on with the Pier our on the coast, sorry but we dont need that either, what we need are teachers in the classrooms not land and piers.† We are in a recession and we definately do not need tax increases when so many are struggling to pay their bills.† Why don't you tighten your belt a bit, do away with the limos, plane rides and other unncecessary spending right there in your office.† I am sure you can do without several aids that you have running around in the capital building, maybe turn out a few lights when your not in the room, eat lunch out of a sack like the rest of ! us.† Lead by example and stop giving us excuses saying oh no we must have more money to pay our expenses, get rid of the waste and crap not needed and I am sure you can come up with enough to keep the teachers on the payroll, perhaps do away with a few workers there that are not needed, print out a few less memo's, maybe plant a few less bushes and flowers in the mediums around the state.† We dont need flowers and bushs we need teachers, schools and roads to get back and forth to our jobs so we can pay all these taxes, like the 30cents per gallon gas tax on top of the sales tax , property taxes, tags and personal property taxes,† your taxing us to death, its time for you to look at that budget again and get rid of the crap we do not need.†
thank you very much, now do your job and figure it out, we have to figure out how to pay our bills on less, so you figure it out too.

Comment: Governor, This email is to communicate to you my displeasure in your decision to raise our taxes. With current economic conditions, the last thing working class people need is a tax increase. It is hard enough to make ends meet with two incomes in a family to raise children and attempt to put two children through college along with everyday living expenses. I hope you can live and sleep at night knowing you are taking food off of the table and putting a real hardship on the average working class family. Sincerely, Cindy Heinbach Honest Working Mom

Comment: Carol Smith congmcintyre@mail.house.gov Elizabethtown, NC 28337-9203 August 16, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: Dear North Carolina legislator, This is not the time to raise taxes in anyway I understand it is hard to write a budget this year because the state is not collecting the taxes it expected. Please do not make it easier on yourself by passing a spend-and-tax budget that makes it harder for my family to make ends meet. Higher taxes would slow our economic recovery and cause more hardships for the 11 percent of people without a job. In 1991 and 2001, your colleagues and predecessors raised taxes to pay for spending programs taxpayers could no longer afford. As a result, North Carolina now has the twentieth highest tax burden in the country, and one of the highest in the South. We have one of the highest income tax rates in the country, and it starts at a lower level of income than most states. We also have the highest corporate income tax rate in the Southeast. The spending and tax plans presented by Gov. Perdue and Senate Democrats would repeat the pattern with up to $1 per pack more for cigarettes, a 280 percent increase in taxes on other kinds of tobacco, higher taxes on beer and alcohol, higher and more complicated income taxes, higher taxes for businesses, and a new six-percent sales tax on everything I do online, plus home repairs, car repairs, extended warranties, or even a haircut. For those of us who do not itemize deductions for our federal tax returns, we will now have to go through that effort for our state taxes so we can claim tax credits or end up paying more. Those of us who do itemize will have to do another round of calculations to determine our state tax credits in addition to our federal deductions. IsnÔøΩt the purpose of tax reform to make the process easier? If I manage to make my mortgage payments to keep my house, even though my federal taxes also pay the mortgage for less responsible borrowers, my reward will be a new six percent tax to keep it in good shape. If I manage to make my car payments, even though my federal taxes also pay for cars I will never see, my reward will be a new six percent tax to keep it running. If I manage to find a new job in another part of the state, I will have to pay a new six percent tax on my moving expenses. If I lose my job or health insurance or if my 401(k) has become a 201(k), my taxes still go to pay for the salaries, pensions, and health insurance of state employees who earn more in salary and benefits than people in the private sector. The problem with the budget this year is not that tax revenues are down. The problem is that state spending has grown beyond the means of taxpayers. The General Fund budget grew 34 percent during Gov. Easley's second term while former Speaker Jim Black was taking money in IHOP bathrooms, and the former governor was flying and driving everywhere in free vehicles. It must be difficult to consider cutting jobs, and not just reassigning state employees as the governor would have done. But too many programs in state government are ineffective or unproven. The more funding they receive, the less will be available for essential programs. Companies have had to shrink and lay off significant numbers of employees- even those that received bailouts. The Federal stimulus money is a band-aid. Please use it to heal the broken state budget, eliminate programs, and not place more burdens on taxpayers. Sincerely, Carol Smith 9108624429

Subject: No Midnight Tax Hike

Comment: Carol Smith congmcintyre@mail.house.gov Elizabethtown, NC 28337-9203 August 17, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am against the 1.8 billion dollars in new taxes proposed by North Carolina House Leaders and set for a stealth midnight vote. It is wrong for North Carolina to raise taxes in a recession and to plan vote in the middle of the night, The Billion dollar House tax increases package is going to hurt the poor and the rich in a bid to get quick cash now for government programs. North Carolina would join fiscal stars New York, New Jersey, California, Illinois, and 11 other states with sales tax rates of seven percent or higher. Higher sales tax in NC makes it much more attractive to purchase goods out of state, esp. Virginia and SC. New Income taxes will penalize individuals and small businesses. NC top marginal tax rates are already the highest in the SE and the ninth highest in the country. Income taxes penalize savings and restrain economic growth. North Carolina already has the 12th worst business tax climate in the country. With these provisions, we may break into the top ten worst. Sincerely, Carol Smith 9108624429

The new budget "deal" is no deal for me. It is wrong for North Carolina to raise taxes in a recession. The governament keeps raising taxes and keep taking away from the people that need help. when some one applys for help the governament counts the gross income and that is not fair. when the taxes and what ever are taken out, you don't recieve the gross. They also ell you to bring in bills, but they don't count the full amount of the bill either. I think they need to redo the system and think of the poor people that really need the help and would not be asking for help unless they really needed it. I realize there are people that cheat the system, but the ones that are loosing are the ones that really need the help. the ones that cheat the system are getting away with it. HELP THE ONES THAT REALLY NEED IT. Sincerely, Sarah Rogers 8286547930

Comment: An excessive $19B State Budget should not have been signed. Much better to prioritize. There is much that should not be on the budget. Taxing exorbitantly and quickly spening so we can tax again just is not productinve for North Carolina.

Subject: A Concerned Citizen's Voice

Comment: I realize that that Governor Perdue will not see this email and that it will likely be deleted or read by a staff person but I wanted to give my opinion and what I believe to be countless other North Carolinian's opinion. The recent 2% surplus tax that the Governor signed will, without doubt, be detrimental to the economy of NC. State spending cuts would go much further to balance the state budget verses putting a greater tax burden upon the hard working families of the state, especially in an economic environment like we are in today. This will just further surpress an already lackluster economy in this state. It would be nice, for once, to have a political leader, of either party, that had the stomach to make the difficult, but necessary, cuts in the budget instead of caving in to politcal party pressure and building a bigger government. It is so easy to spend other people's money.

Starting September my shopping and any thing else I purchase will be in Virigina,Tenn.and South Carolina. Its not a burden for me to rebel against people who take advantage of the poor. And while we are at it lets cut some of your trips and dinners, lets see you brown bag like the rest of us have to, even better lets cut or freeze you salary also. Shame on you I'll be praying that God will take care of this problem.

Subject: New Tax Law

Comment: As a tax professional practicing in this state I was appalled to find in the new law a ‚Äútax surcharge‚Äù ranging from 2% to 3% for taxpayers meeting certain taxable income thresholds. It was my understanding from reading in the public media that Ms. Purdue claimed she would veto any such type of legislation, it seems she didn‚Äôt live up to her word or cannot read. The new legislation is much more harsh on the taxpayers than the first tax ‚Äúsurcharge‚Äù that was proposed. I, as a citizen of North Carolina cannot believe the legislature has imposed an additional tax, and the Governor signed, on the citizens of this state in light of the current economic situation. It truly shows the lack of sagacity of our elected officials. As a business owner I do not have the luxury of raising my prices or I will loose customers. I must resort to cost cutting, including salary and employee benefit cuts. Governments should have to follow the same concept. I do realize there have been cuts in the state budget, but I did not read about any salary or benefit cuts across the board. I think state officials should think like small business people and every state employee making more than $125K should take a 5% pay cut including the Governor. Not only would this reduce wage costs but would also reduce payroll taxes and matching pension costs. Consider reducing the over all government and not placing an additional burden on the already economically suffering people of this great state. All of you should be a shamed of yourselves! Based on what I am hearing from the public arena sounds as if there will be newly elected officials in ‚Äô10 and ‚Äô12 in this state.

Subject: Taxes

Comment: Governor Purdue: You have inherited a fiscal mess from your tax and spend predecessors. Unfortunately, while cutting some costs, your answer to everything is to tax the "rich". First of all, your definition of "rich" is laughable, secondly, there is only 100% of income you and Mr. Obama can take and you are quickly getting there via various creative and some not so creative taxes. That is not what this great country and this great State were based on. Before your recent tax increases North Carolina was already taxed more than most of the other states (per capita tax $ as a percent of income). We need smaller and more responsible government. If you follow in your predecessor's footsteps and/or follow Mr. Obama's lead, you won't be getting my vote in the next election and the current ground swell of frustrated North Carolinians will grow beyond your worst nightmare. I hope and pray that you step up lead us through these difficult times in a responsible way. Thank you, Dave Miller

The last thing that North Carolinians can afford is higher taxes. Sincerely, Elaine McKinney 828-441-2134

Gov. Perdue visits Surry and Alleghany counties

Surry County

On Tuesday, Gov. Perdue attended a class and met with students at the Surry Early College High School of Design on Surry Community Collegeís campus in Dobson.† North Carolina is†a national leader when it comes to Early Colleges, with 70 locations.† Students enrolled in this program attend high school on a college campus for five years and finish with a high school diploma and two years of transferable college credit or an associate degree ñ at no cost to the student.

Gov. Perdue met with Principal Celia Hodges, Community College President Dr. Deborah Friedman, members of the collegeís board, and other local education officials.† Most importantly, Gov. Perdue had the opportunity to sit in on a†biology class taught by Jeff Edwards.†

Students told the Governor about being excited to ìget a really good head start on lifeî and about how North Carolinaís Early College program makes higher education affordable to them.† Innovative programs like this are important to Gov. Perdueís goal of putting higher education within reach for all North Carolinians.

Alleghany County

On Wednesday, Gov. Perdue†visited Sparta Elementary School.† As part of President Obamaís ìUnited We Serveî campaign for†community service and volunteerism, the governor spoke with students about their responsibility of giving back to their communities.† She read the†children's book ìIím Gonna Like Me: Letting Off A Little Self-Esteemî by actress Jamie Lee Curtis to†a first grade class.†

The governor†also had the chance to talk to Superintendent Cox, Principal Barnes,†and teachers†about how technology is making a difference in their classrooms and about diagnostic testing.

DuPont Brings $55 Million Expansion to Bladen County

DuPont will add a new facility on a portion of its Fayetteville Works campus in Bladen County, creating 10 jobs and investing $55 million during the next three years.† The announcement of the new plant, which will make a key component in solar energy panels, was made possible in part by a $50,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

ìDuPont's expansion confirms that we are reaping the benefits from our investments in a knowledge-based work force and community infrastructure,î Perdue said.† ìSupport of our existing industries, education and an exceptional quality of life are among the many reasons North Carolina's business climate is consistently ranked among the top in the nation.î

DuPont employs 60,000 workers in 70 countries worldwide, including more than 900 at N.C. facilities in Fayetteville, Kinston and the Research Triangle Park.† The new plant, in Bladen County near the Cumberland-Bladen County line, will produce polymer for DuPont ô TedlarÆ polyvinyl fluoride film used in the protective backsheets of photovoltaic solar panels.† These panels convert light into electric power.† The photovoltaic industry is experiencing worldwide growth as consumers turn to alternatives such as fossil fuels.†

Salaries for the 10 new skilled manufacturer positions will vary by job type, but the average annual wage will be $36,278, not including benefits, more than the Bladen County average annual wage of $25,792.

Gov. Perdue Announces Launch of 15th Anniversary "Booze It & Lose It" Campaign

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced the launch of the 15th anniversary ìBooze It & Lose Itî mobilization to crack down on impaired drivers. The Labor Day ìBooze It & Lose Itî campaign will begin Aug. 21 and run until Sept. 7.

ìUnder no circumstance is drinking and driving acceptable in North Carolina,î said Perdue. ìFor 15 years, the ëBooze It & Lose Ití initiative has played a critical role in protecting our citizens by educating the public and cracking down on impaired driving. Weíll keep using this life-saving campaign as a tool to enforce our stateís anti-drinking and driving laws.î

In North Carolina in 2008, there were 11,968 alcohol-related crashes resulting in 433 fatalities and 9,263 injuries.

ìBooze It & Lose Itî is administered by the N.C. Governorís Highway Safety Program. The initiative began in 1994 and was created to zero in on impaired drivers with innovative and extensive anti-driving while impaired enforcement and education. Since 1994, law enforcement agencies have conducted more than 194,000 checkpoints and patrols during ìBooze It & Lose Itî campaigns resulting in more than 103,000 driving while impaired citations.

Additional checkpoints and patrols will be conducted across the state throughout the campaign.

Fight the Flu - Back to School

As thousands of students in North Carolina prepare to return to school, many will be armed with notebooks and pencils, but†they†also should be armed with tips to fight the spread of seasonal and H1N1 flu.

Everyone is advised to get a seasonal Flu Vaccine. H1N1 vaccines are expected by late†fall. High risk groups, including school-aged children, are advised to get a double dose H1N1 vaccination.

Prevention is critical.† Here are some simple steps:

1) Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.† If†you donít have tissue, cough or sneeze into your sleeve.

2) Wash your hands often with soap and water. Alcohol-based hand cleaners†also are effective.

3) Avoid close contact with sick people.

4) If you are sick, stay home to limit†the chances of infecting others.

Subject: No New Taxes

Comment: David Cotter 5906 Tropic Ct Wilmington, NC 28409-3451 August 23, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am against the billions in new taxes proposed by North Carolina House and Senate leaders. The new budget "deal" is no deal for me. It is wrong for North Carolina to raise taxes in a recession. North Carolina already has the 12th worst business tax climate in the country. With these provisions, we may break into the top ten worst. Income taxes penalize savings and restrain economic growth. Small business owners fuel the economy, higher taxes on income mean less income generated in the state. New Income taxes will penalize individuals and small businesses The new income tax surcharge amounts to a new tax on taxes already owed. Sincerely, David Cotter

Subject: tax increase and budget

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue: I applaud your asking for a 5% cut in budgets, but they should be considered permanent. Since government has no competition, there is no incentive for employees to be careful with funds. I highly doubt much of this 5% was ever necessary. In your decision to raise taxes, did you consider at all the State of Michigan? Gov. Granholm has raised taxes, primarily on business, and it has only served to deter both small and large businesses from locating there, and pushed many out of the state. Also, individuals have less money to spend on goods and services. Regards, Kim Keiser

I am very frustrated at†state government†for†raising taxes during a severe recession.† Individuals and business are forced to cut back, but the government simply raises taxes and soldiers on.† Now I will have the priviledge of paying an additional one cent NC sales tax, more taxes on alcohol (which I will now purchase in South Carolina), and a surcharge on my state income tax.† I reject the argument that "vital" services would go unfunded if these tax increase were not passed.† California balanced their state budget without raising taxes........it can be done.† The increase in the sales tax is particularly irritating to me......it proves that the state is unwilling or unable to grow†at the same pace as†the NC economy.†State government†continues to take a larger and larger slice of the economic pie.† Taxes like the NC income tax surcharge, aimed at the most productive and highly compensated citizens of the state†are unfair and make the onerous tax burden of the affluent even more difficult.† The lack of a competent†tax policy†is apparent.††Every time there is a revenue shortfall the same whipping boys are trotted out......tax the rich, tax alcohol, tax cigarettes.†

The Charlotte Observer recently ran a story exposing the tremendous growth in administrative jobs in the NC University System.†I think this observation is symptomatic of state government†in general.† There are plenty of savings to be had, and plenty of cuts that could take place without most citizens of the state ever knowing that it†happened.†

Lastly, NC needs to change the way in which road money is allocated around the state.† Western NC, and the Charlotte†area in particular are being short changed.† The current funding through DOT districts is totally political and doesn't prioritize road projects properly.† A "miles driven" system makes much more sense and would direct scarce funds where they are needed the most.† The fact that a Fayetteville bypass is even being considered while I-485 sits unfinished is proof that our system is broken.

Subject: [Office of Governor Bev Perdue] Governor visits Surry and AlleghanyCounties





Gov. Perdue visits Surry and Alleghany counties

Surry County

On Tuesday, Gov. Perdue attended a class and met with students at the Surry Early College High School of Design on Surry Community Collegeís campus in Dobson.† North Carolina is†a national leader when it comes to Early Colleges, with 70 locations.† Students enrolled in this program attend high school on a college campus for five years and finish with a high school diploma and two years of transferable college credit or an associate degree ñ at no cost to the student.

Gov. Perdue met with Principal Celia Hodges, Community College President Dr. Deborah Friedman, members of the collegeís board, and other local education officials.† Most importantly, Gov. Perdue had the opportunity to sit in on a†biology class taught by Jeff Edwards.†

Students told the Governor about being excited to ìget a really good head start on lifeî and about how North Carolinaís Early College program makes higher education affordable to them.† Innovative programs like this are important to Gov. Perdueís goal of putting higher education within reach for all North Carolinians.

Alleghany County

On Wednesday, Gov. Perdue†visited Sparta Elementary School.† As part of President Obamaís ìUnited We Serveî campaign for†community service and volunteerism, the governor spoke with students about their responsibility of giving back to their communities.† She read the†children's book ìIím Gonna Like Me: Letting Off A Little Self-Esteemî by actress Jamie Lee Curtis to†a first grade class.†

The governor†also had the chance to talk to Superintendent Cox, Principal Barnes,†and teachers†about how technology is making a difference in their classrooms and about diagnostic testing.

DuPont Brings $55 Million Expansion to Bladen County

DuPont will add a new facility on a portion of its Fayetteville Works campus in Bladen County, creating 10 jobs and investing $55 million during the next three years.† The announcement of the new plant, which will make a key component in solar energy panels, was made possible in part by a $50,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

ìDuPont's expansion confirms that we are reaping the benefits from our investments in a knowledge-based work force and community infrastructure,î Perdue said.† ìSupport of our existing industries, education and an exceptional quality of life are among the many reasons North Carolina's business climate is consistently ranked among the top in the nation.î

DuPont employs 60,000 workers in 70 countries worldwide, including more than 900 at N.C. facilities in Fayetteville, Kinston and the Research Triangle Park.† The new plant, in Bladen County near the Cumberland-Bladen County line, will produce polymer for DuPont ô TedlarÆ polyvinyl fluoride film used in the protective backsheets of photovoltaic solar panels.† These panels convert light into electric power.† The photovoltaic industry is experiencing worldwide growth as consumers turn to alternatives such as fossil fuels.†

Salaries for the 10 new skilled manufacturer positions will vary by job type, but the average annual wage will be $36,278, not including benefits, more than the Bladen County average annual wage of $25,792.

For more information about DuPontô TedlarÆ films or potential job opportunities, please visit: <http://www.dupont.com>www.dupont.com.

Swedish Firm Relocates U.S. Headquarters to Charlotte

Biotage LLC, a Swedish company that develops and manufactures instruments and consumables for pharmaceutical research, will relocate its United States headquarters to Charlotte.† The company plans to invest in facility upgrades and create 21 new jobs in Mecklenburg County.

ìNorth Carolina is known globally as a strategic location for tapping into the North American market,î Perdue said.† ìOur top-rated business climate and highly skilled workforce continue to attract global companies looking to invest and expand.î

Biotage is a leading supplier of tools and technology for medicinal and analytical chemistry and process development.† The company, headquartered in Sweden, has offices in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Japan and employs nearly 270 workers worldwide.

The company is planning to move its U.S. headquarters from Virginia to North Carolina.† Operations in Charlotte will include general administration, marketing and sales, and lab work for applications development, light manufacturing and distribution.

Gov. Perdue Announces Launch of 15th Anniversary "Booze It & Lose It" Campaign

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced the launch of the 15th anniversary ìBooze It & Lose Itî mobilization to crack down on impaired drivers. The Labor Day ìBooze It & Lose Itî campaign will begin Aug. 21 and run until Sept. 7.

ìUnder no circumstance is drinking and driving acceptable in North Carolina,î said Perdue. ìFor 15 years, the ëBooze It & Lose Ití initiative has played a critical role in protecting our citizens by educating the public and cracking down on impaired driving. Weíll keep using this life-saving campaign as a tool to enforce our stateís anti-drinking and driving laws.î

In North Carolina in 2008, there were 11,968 alcohol-related crashes resulting in 433 fatalities and 9,263 injuries.

ìBooze It & Lose Itî is administered by the N.C. Governorís Highway Safety Program. The initiative began in 1994 and was created to zero in on impaired drivers with innovative and extensive anti-driving while impaired enforcement and education. Since 1994, law enforcement agencies have conducted more than 194,000 checkpoints and patrols during ìBooze It & Lose Itî campaigns resulting in more than 103,000 driving while impaired citations.

Additional checkpoints and patrols will be conducted across the state throughout the campaign.

Fight the Flu - Back to School

As thousands of students in North Carolina prepare to return to school, many will be armed with notebooks and pencils, but†they†also should be armed with tips to fight the spread of seasonal and H1N1 flu.

Everyone is advised to get a seasonal Flu Vaccine. H1N1 vaccines are expected by late†fall. High risk groups, including school-aged children, are advised to get a double dose H1N1 vaccination.

Prevention is critical.† Here are some simple steps:

1) Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.† If†you donít have tissue, cough or sneeze into your sleeve.

2) Wash your hands often with soap and water. Alcohol-based hand cleaners†also are effective.

3) Avoid close contact with sick people.

4) If you are sick, stay home to limit†the chances of infecting others.

The House and Senate are considering different plans, but here are a few of the suggestions on the table that will hurt North Carolina families and businesses. * A so-called ÔøΩGoogleÔøΩ sales tax on internet purchases like digital books and music that will stifle commerce and presents obvious constitutionality questions. * A $1-per-pack tax hike on cigarettes that comes on top of a recent federal hike and will push smokers to purchase cigarettes on the black market and hurt small businesses like convenience stores. * An alcohol tax that will slam an already suffering hospitality industry. * Taxes on lawn care and car repairs. * A sales tax hike. * An income tax hike for certain tax brackets. These taxes present a severe burden for families who are already suffering in this economic downturn and who face higher taxes and fees not only at the state level, but at the federal and county levels, too.

Comment: With the present economic situation, and the fact that my husbands' small business is so struggling to survive that he is paying his employees but not himself, I am at a loss of words at the upcoming 1% sales tax increase! We work hard to provide for our family, but yet you strive to make if even more difficult for us! Since we live in Mecklenburg County, will be paying the outrageous amount of 8.25%. Why would anyone want to come to live here and afford it???? And this is supposed to be a "temporary" tax, I will believe that when I see it. I am sure that our state can stop unnecessary and frivolous spending in lieu of increases.

You have increased sales tax again. You people do not think things through. How do you expect the economy to get better.  When you make it more expensive to purchase.  You have already run a major employer out of NC by raising cigarette taxes.  You people are idiots.  Why don't you consider taking a pay cut and putting the money back into the state?  Now you are going to try and give gangs members jobs. You have got to be kidding me.  How about locking them up. These are very hardcore peoplee do you honestly think you can reform them by giving them a min wage job. Why do you think they choose to turn to gang life to begin with. All you will do is bring crime into the workplace. How about getting the good people jobs. You do not have a clue.
