Subject: SEB Benefits

Comment: Diane Parker 2303 Lakeshore Dr. Fort Oglethorpe, GA 30742-4164 June 22, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Governor Perdue: Dear Sir/Madam: My situation with the extension of benefits and how the states of NC and Ga are keeping my money that is due to me. I can't find a job and now they won't give me any money at all. I was given your names and told I should write to you to let you know my situation so here it goes. I will explain up to this point and why I have to file an Interstate claim aside from the fact that the GA government is really doing me wrong. My husband is a electrical and mechanical service technician who works on overhead cranes, which which is a specialty business. This business is not like being an typical trade such as a plumber or electrician where you can get a job just anywhere. He's been working on overhead cranes for about 20 years now. Back in 2007 we lived in NC and I worked at a company which I was going on 2 years at the time. His company decided they wanted him to pick up and move to GA to start an office in the Atlanta area. He's a remote tech by the way. Anyway, I had to resign from my company and we headed to GA, at our expense. He started his job, I got a job as an Office Administrator/OSHA coordinator among various other duties such as employee insurance and handling the salemen's needs. We made this move in January and they had him stay there for around 7 months then one day he gets a call from his boss and says he needs him to come back up there and work for awhile so we decided I would stay down here and he would stay and rent a room from someone which went on for about 3 months. This too was a strain on our marriage as aeb0309's was but I had a good job and he had a good job and we couldn't afford to lose either one. I figured we have been married 7 years and had a wonderful, strong relationship, never even a big fight all those years. In November of 2007 they send him back to GA which was wonderful!! I had my husband home for good. We were rocking along and then in January of 2008 they tell him he needs to go back to NC or he will just need to find another job so we move back to NC at this point, again at our expense. In the meantime I was laid off the last week of December from my job in the middle of my 90 days so it didn't effect my employment. We get back to NC, he is working for about 6 months then they decide to let layoff my husband. He had been working for them for 5 years too. So he gets a job at another crane company which in the area of NC there are only about 4 of them total so his choices are very thin. He is there 3 months and the economy starts getting real slow, he doesn't even get a increase in his 90 days, I am working at a real good company that I started in October and very happy with my job. In November we decided something had to be done because he was not getting any hours and by the end of December he had submitted a resume to a company in the NE part of GA and they hired him. This is where he would be getting work in GA and the TN area. He comes out here and I have to give up my job in NC while I am still in my 90 period and still in training no less. I gave my letter of resignation and we all agreed that since I was in training it was better for me to go ahead and leave and not waste the trainers time. I get to GA at the end of December with him after he's lived here about 3 weeks in a 300 square ft. apartment, we move to a 600 square ft. apt. because I am living in NC in a 1020 sq ft. apartment where we have lived all those months when we moved back to NC. In the meantime I had collected unemployment until I had finally got that job there. When I moved back to Ga and in January I filed for unemployment and I got the 1st and 2nd tier and in April I had exhausted my 2nd tier and my unemployment ran completely out which my last payment was April 11th 2009. They automatically gave me the 2nd tier and so I recieved the letter for the 3rd tier which was for the SEB signed April 21st 2009. This was for the people who had exhausted all their benefits on or after Feb. 21st 2009. I have been recieving the unemployment for the 1st and 2nd tier in GA as an Interstate claim since these were combined wages with NC and it was the NC DOL that told me to make sure I tell GA that I had these combined wages to received unemployment which I did and which I received benefits up until I exhausted my benefits on April 11th, being my last unemployment check. I was told by Mrs. Curtis in Policies and Procedures of GA on Thursday June 19th (which was my 28th day) that I could not receive my extended benefits for the SEB because I had monetary funds in NC which is now showing up in the base period now for the 4th quarter in December. This is not fair at all because I was only trying to get another extension of benefits and I did what I was told I had to do. Now because I left NC because my husband had to find work or we were going to lose our car, our apartment and not be able to eat so it was a matter of survival that we move, to eat. And again, this was at our expense which you can't even imagine how much this has cost us to move at this point. Carol Lewis with the NC DOL said that I was not eligible for those funds in NC because I left my company to move back to GA with my husband. I asked her was I suppose to leave my husband to stay there in NC? I am completely entitled to these funds because this is an extension of my exhausted benefits in GA from my 2nd tier. In April I was told I received a letter from the GA Dept of Labor saying that NC is saying I have to report and file on line with NC for the money sitting in my account for NC so I did, now Mrs. Curtis says they can't give me the SEB funds unless NC releases my claim there and I will probably not get it now even if they do release it. All of this is going on during the period that the 3rd tier, SEB was signed and passed so they should have just rolled my SEB right over to me since I am still unemployed, can't even get a callback for a job and it is becoming a strain on my marriage as well. I have become very depressed but trying to do online schooling to get a better education and change my career in the meantime. I deserve the SEB because it again is an EXTENSION OF THE BENEFITS THAT I HAVE BEEN RECEIVING UP UNTIL APRIL 11TH WHEN I EXHAUSTED MY BENEFITS. Now I have no income whatsoever and can't get a call back for work. Can you tell me what I need to do? cc: President Obama, Governor Perdue-NC and GA, Senators NC and GA, Representatives NC and Ga Sincerely, Diane Parker 404-273-9415 Employer Name: None Are you a registered voter?: Yes Did you vote in the last election?: Yes Age: 53 Gender: Female Would you like a reply?: Yes Have you visited our website?: Yes Diane Parker sent this message via Congress.org, which uses the Capwizï¿½XC system.

Subject: expungement of felony

Comment: I was convicted of possession of marijuana in 1997 when I was 17 years old. I was charged as an adult and at the time had no idea of the consequences involved. I have searched and searched for the proper statutes for felony expungement and have found none that fit. I only have 2 traffic violations since that day in 1997 and have worked hard to be a good person. I would like to know if there is anything else for me to try. I have heard of governors pardons and know that they are rare. I have nothing else to try at this point. I thank you in advance for everything. Brian Pendry (336)692-3398

Subject: biographical material

Comment: I'm writing a book for Congressional Quarterly and am currently working on female governors. I need standard biographical information that I can't find (at least easily) on the website. Will you please provide me with a birthdate for Governor Perdue, as well as the names and dates of college degrees? I assume that the governor's first marriage must have ended in divorce, but should confirm that she was not widowed. I was very pleased with her election -- as well as that of your new US senator, but I need these standard facts. Please include also the dates of her campaigns for the legislature and for lieutenant governor, as well as anything else you think relevant. You may check out my veracity by googling my name; my Authors Guild website should come up. Thanks!

Comment: I am writing today on behalf of nephew who is currently serving on his 2nd tour in Iraq. He is due to come home in 2 weeks. He is also set for his final discharge from the Army in Sept, 2009. He hs been in since Feb of 2003. He is from High Point, NC. I live in Virginia and am contacting you also on behalf of our family. My sister is beside herself, and she currently has custody of my great-neice. She is afrid to be too vocal as she is a federl employee and fears she could lose her job. My entire family is distressed and concerned about the amount of severe, intense, and serious pressure he is being subjected to under the guise of re-enlistment. He is currently being THREATENED if he continues to refuse to re-enlist. He has been told the Army will rescend ALL of his earned benefits if he continues to refuse to re-enlist. That they will see to it he loses ALL his education benefits, he will lose ALL his entitled medical benefits. EVERYTHING he hs earned will be taken from him if he continues to refuse to re-enlist. As of today, he is being threatened with NO Discharge at all, AND they say they will not let him leave Iraq as he is scheduled to do in just 2 weeks, and they will move his name back up to the top of the deployment list, and he will have to serve another full tour without even coming home. All of this to FORCE him to re-enlist against his will. They are threatening to refuse to discharge him at all, and keep him in the Army indefinitely, And in Iraq. He is already stressed, and has suffered with the diagnosis of "anxiety" disorder that is really undiagnosed PTSD, and he took medication for it. We fear that he will become more stressed and depressed from these serious threats. He is already extremely upset over this. We fear he may even become suicidal if they make him feel this trapped and hopeless. He has a 2 year old daughter, and is the sole parent of this child. He just wants to come home to his family and raise his daughter. It is SHAMEFUL that our soldiers cannot even be discharged without threats to their benefits, threats to their earned discharges, and this is causing threats to their mental health as well. It should be criminal too. What can we as his family do to stop this harssment??? We feel you should know this is going on, and we ask for your help so they cannot make good on their threats to keep him in Iraq indefinitely. Please help us ! Thank You, Joyce Brinegar

Subject: Child Support Enforcement--Division of NC HHS

Comment: Hi. I am a proud North Carolinean; however over the past year I have become disappointed in the efforts of the NC Child Support Enforcement Division to act on my behalf as constituent of this great state. I have had an open case for nearly 1.5 years now due to lack of communication between my caseworker, me, and the state of Maryland (non-custodial parent lives in MD). My NC caseworker has been changed several times; whomever my caseworker was last fall lost my original copy of Affidavit of Parentage; I have called several times just to speak with a caseworker about the documents from November 2008 to February 2009 without a response; I was told that my case would be closed from lack of response from me also. When I finally was able to speak with my new caseworker I was told that Maryland workers were the problem. Thus, I contacted the Governor of Maryland April 19. Since then I have spoken with Mr. Walker in the MD Governor's office; Mrs. Shay in the MD Child Support; and Mrs. Frierson in MD Child Support. I am now told that my NC caseworker is non responsive. As a public administrator I understand the heavy case loads a caseworker must have. However, non response is not acceptable. As public administrators we are called to service the people, and this is what I strive for on a daily basis. Thus, I am disheartened to learn from another state that my own state of NC is at fault simply from not doing what we are charged to do as public administrators. I have personally apologized to Mr. Walker of the MD Governor's Office for North Carolina's lack of public service and non-responsive public administrators. As a public administrator and an urban policy doctoral student, I am not only embarassed, but appalled. I am embarassed due to the above events (lack of communication; unplaced blame on others; lack of service, etc.) and appalled that in these times of economic hardship there seems to be a lack of empathy on behalf of the NC Child Support Enforcement Division to make sure that cases are sufficiently finalized. And, the biggest problem is that this situation is not about me; it is about my 4 yr. old daughter. She is the one suffering from this situation. I simply ask that I may be provided some assistance in finalizing my case, in the form of feedback to not only me, but to MD as well. Additionally, I believe our child support enforcement division needs to be re-evaluated, making sure that the processes are considered. Also, the people that the child support enforcement division fights for need to be considered.

Subject: PLEASE Need help to expedite VISA

Comment: I am pleading for Mercy and that you will allow Walter Rene Sauceda Ribi (Visa case number TGG2008557002 ) my husband to return to the US with our daughter, myself and soon to be born son due Sept. 21, 2009. As a family, we have suffered greatly since Walter was taken into custody by ICE agents in March of 2007. We were under the impression that Walter was living and working in the US legally due to an EAD care they understood to be part of TPS that he continually applied for and received. On the day that Walter was taken from their home at 6:30am we had a scheduled appointment with immigration concerning the denial of WalterÂ´s EAD/TPS renewal. From the USCIS website Walter met all the qualifications to receive TPS (Temporary Protected Status). A warrant for WalterÂ´s arrest was filled both to the surprise of him and myself. The warrant had been issued in 1997 when he failed to leave the US voluntarily, but we understood Walter to be under TPS and the warrant to be invalid. Our family was separated and Walter was placed into prison when our daughter was ten months. As a family we have suffered greatly emotionally. The entire family has been traumatized by the separations we face. Our daughter cries with a pulse that makes your heart wrench. She doesnÂ´t understand why she has to be apart from her father. My daughter and I are only allowed to be in Honduras 90 days at a time because we are US citizens and Walter upon deportation was told he could not return to the US for ten years. We plead for mercy that WalterÂ´s visa will be issued in time for him to be present for the birth of our unborn son due September 21, 2009. As July 31st approaches the day we must fly back to the US the entire family is suffering stress and depression as we are dreading the separation from each other. Our desire is to be united permanently and that Walter will be able to be at my side to welcome our son into the world. Please grant our request and have mercy on our family who has suffered greatly due to laws and communications from immigration which are unclear and not concise. Pleading for mercy. Gloria Concha de Sauceda

Subject: Mooresville ESC Never heard of JobsNow

Comment: Dear Gov. Bev Perdue: My wife and I are distraught over the blatant resistance by employers to hire us. we are at great risk of losing our home and major contents. I am 55, African American, hold B.S in Biology, have 15+ years chemical lab experience, Vet, well traveled, learned German, and inventive. I moved to Mooresville in June 2006 to work at BestSweet, however race prejudice and excessive company pressure forced me to resign after one week. We spent over $5,000 to relocate here. I applied for department store jobs, temporary, low paying, and on many websites. To my surprise ESC in Mooresville says that they never heard of JobsNOW. My wife is an experienced RN and she trained in South Afica in a para military corp. Magdaline was a member of Dr. Christiaan Barnard's heart transplant patient support. She has always been a highly regarded nurse according to the doctors. Despite that she has had to fight envy, racism, and irritible patients. She is extremely depressed because the company she worked for suddenly gave her an ultimatum to take a very tough job at terrible hours. She had trained very hard and traveled 1,200 miles+ (I helped her, too) training for a dialysis position near home and someone or persons within her comany made a decision to cancel her position last May. Magdaline is over 60 and they knew this. We have never experienced such utter cruelty and inhumane attitudes during our lives. It will be an absolute shame to North Carolina if we have to take our experience and talent to another state. As an inventor I could develop products that would produce millions of dollars and provide hundreds of jobs. If I never get an opportunity to earn a living then it won't happen. Who will assist me to obtain the biotechnology training that will avail me the opportunities offered?

Subject: UI Benefits

Comment: I was informed on April 24, 2009 that I needed to file a claim with NC DOL since I had monetary wages there. I filed a claim, got register with GA DOL and then received a call on June 25, 2009 telling me that since I left the company I was with in NC from Oct-Dec 16, 2008 to follow my spouse to new employment I was not eligible for my benefits. On January 8th, 2007 I had to resign the company I was working at in NC and move to GA with my husband as well due to him changing jobs. Once I got to GA I was able to file a claim and I received my benefits. What is the difference between now and then? Why is it that I wasn't denied then and I am being denied now and it was the same circumstances? I worked too hard to be treated like this and for NC to keep my benefits. I need to pay rent, pay for my car so that I can find a job which has been extremely difficult and also it's nice to be able to have money to eat.
