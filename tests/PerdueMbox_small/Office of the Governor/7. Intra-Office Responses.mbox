Dear Ms. Mariani,

The Office of Citizen Services is in receipt of your e-mail correspondence to Governor Bev Perdue.

For your information, the Office of Citizen Services is responsible for responding to inquiries and complaints that are within the jurisdiction of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. This office also administers the CARE-LINE (1-800-662-7030) which is a statewide, toll-free information and referral telephone service. Our office serves as a clearinghouse for information on the many human service programs offered in this state. The CARE-LINE Information and Referral Service as well as our e-mail service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including holidays. I also want to make you aware of the NCcareLINK. Please visit <https://www.NCcareLINK.gov> for your connection to up-to-date information about programs and services offered across North Carolina.

In your email you have questions in regards to your son's unemployment benefits. He may apply for unemployment benefits through the Wake County Employment Security Commission at (919) 212-3849 or online at <https://www.ncesc.com/home.asp>. If he has already applied and is awaiting a decision, any eligibility questions should be directed to that local Employment Security Commission.

You also mentioned that the family does not current have health insurance. Questions about COBRA coverage should be directed to the U.S. Department of Labor at www.dol.gov/ebsa or at 1-866-444-3272 <http://www.dol.gov/ebsa%20or%20at%201-866-444-3272>.

Also, Medicaid is the only state supported health insurance in North Carolina. While there are a number of programs and services funded by the Department of Health and Human Services, all in-take, including eligibility, is administered by a local Department of Social Services (DSS). I encourage you or your son to contact his local DSS in the county in which he is currently residing to determine eligibility and make an application.  To locate contact information for his local Social Services office, please visit the following website: <http://www.dhhs.state.nc.us/dss/local/>.

If their family income and/or resources are over the limit and they have high medical bills, they may still qualify for Medicaid and have a Medicaid deductible. A Medicaid deductible is much like a private insurance deductible. You must pay a certain amount of medical bills before insurance pays. Unlike private insurance, the Medicaid deductible is based on your income. If your countable income is more than the Medicaid income limit, you will have a deductible. A Medicaid deductible is met by adding up medical costs. Payments for medical care, supplies and prescriptions may apply to your deductible. You will be authorized for Medicaid on the date that the bills add up to the amount of the deductible. You will be authorized to receive Medicaid through the end of the 6 month certification period.

Information regarding Medicaid eligibility can also be found at <http://www.dhhs.state.nc.us/dma/medicaid/who.htm>. He may download applications from the website and mail or take in the completed packet to your local Department of Social Services.

Upon receiving your e-mail I searched our database for additional agencies and organizations that offer programs which may be of assistance to your son's family. I have included program and contact information for these agencies below. I encourage you or your family to reach out to staff in these offices as they may know of other avenues of assistance for which our office is not aware.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing to you today as a very concerned mother. I live in NY state and my son Steven Kishpaugh, his wife Margie and their four young children live in Wake Forest, NC.

Unfortunately, Steve was layed off from his job on 4/30/09. To date he has not received any unemployment benefits and has not received anything from COBRA.

The whole procedure has been very stressful to the family and they are currently draining their savings to live.

My son has always been a hard worker and a good provider.

It was quite by accident that I learned of his circumstances being his pride wouldn't allow him to tell me.

When I learned my 8 yr old grandson couldn't play baseball this year because there was no money for it, my heart was broken.

They continue to call and inquire but to no avail. I think someone has dropped the ball.

At this point they have no health insurance and no unemployment coming in.     Please help them.

Comment: Gov. Perdue, thank you so much for your work to protect kids in schools from harassment. I admire your commitment to good education and safe schools. Will there be a signing ceremony for the School Violence Prevention Act that just passed the legislature yesterday? I'd like to bring my 7-year-old kid to the capitol, and I thought this would be a great thing for him to witness. Again, thank you for your service to our state and our children.

But, since this movement has come to light recently, plus the fact that she was born in 1928, and neither she nor her sister ever became pregnant despite efforts (resorting to adoption), and the fact that they were illiterate and extremely dirt poor farming people in Eden, NC has led me to suspect perhaps she was onto something. Is there a list of names? Is there any way to know for sure? Thanks for any help you can provide, sincerely, Lori King

Dear Ms. Battle:



Thank you for your e-mail regarding early childhood education in North Carolina.  Governor Perdue appreciates you taking time express your concerns. Please know that despite these tough economic times, she is focused on protecting education.



You will be happy to learn that the Governor did not include any consolidation of the early education programs in my recent budget proposal, and did not reduce the services that would be provided under these programs.  For further details, please read the budget proposal at:  <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/>www.governor.state.nc.us.



Budget discussions are currently underway in the General Assembly.  We encourage you to continue working with your local legislators to explain your concerns about the consolidation of the programs.  A complete listing of the General Assembly members can be accessed at:  <http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/>http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/ .



Thank you all for contacting our office.  We appreciate your advocacy for education.

The Governor is considering each choice very carefully as we work together to get North Carolina back on track.  In these difficult times, we are making some very tough decisions to deal with a nearly $5 billion shortfall.  She will keep your ideas in mind as we work to improve the quality of life in North Carolina.

Subject: Early Childhood

Comment: I am an Early Childhood Educator. I am also a MAF (More at Four) teacher. I also recieve WAGE$ supplements twice per year. North Carolina wants the people that are involved in Early Childhood to attend school and receive more education and work for low wages, long hours, and minimal working conditions, limited health benefits. I personally voted for you because I believed you would help the people. I personally benefit from the wages project. I use this money to catch up bills and buy gifts for my family at Christmas. I have been a single parent and raised two children, one of whom is handicapped. I also used to be a former FCCH. I now work for a four star center. The children in my classrom did well at Kindergarten screening. I love teaching but rules and regulations make it hard to want to stay in education. As educators, we often see more of the children in our care than their parents. We help shape these children's lives before they even enter school. Please do more to help us. Thank you for your time.

Subject: State Teacher's Budget

Comment: My daughter has just completed her first year as a lateral entry 4th grade teacher. Her EOG scores for Math were the highest in her school. She is in the Licensure Plus Program at Greensboro College where she has been working to obtain her teaching license as well as obtain a Masters Degree in Education. She made a career change for one reason...children. She is passionate about education for all children and making a difference for them in the classroom setting. She loves and respects these children and shows them how powerful education is. Unfortunately, her life is on hold. Will she get to pursue her dream with students who love and are counting on her or will she get to enroll for unemployment and collect food stamps while trying to secure another position?Her insurance through the school system will expire June 30th. Her tuition at Greensboro College has been paid and regardless of the payment status for her education, she has made a committment to the students at her school to provide them with something powerful...a great education. Raleigh is superb at talking a big talk. I speak for myself and my community when I say that this is not what we elected you and others in Raleigh to do for our schools. I am sure the "fat" can be cut elsewhere in Raliegh. I have followed your campaign trail urging for the increase in state taxes to lessen the bleeding on our education system. This is a great first step but what else are you doing in the meantime so that education can keep moving?? As a taxpayer, I understand that the fiscal year begins again next week, July 1st. And I also realize that the funds they will receive from the State are not being made known at this time. Are you waiting for school to start session again? Do you think that education stops for the summer? I know you believe it is time for teachers to suffer like the rest of the American population. I guess when your term is over, you can let the next governor deal with the mess our education system is in. I urge you to "lead" and "take action" now. Stop standing still and support education. This is why you were elected in my community to begin with due to your tv campaign and your advocacy for education as a prior teacher. I assure you my daughter and myself know how to balance our budgets. By making a decision and "moving," education will work much better than funding all of the laid off educators who will depend on unempolyment and other state funded services such as food stamps, etc. I know your term will be over but I'm sure it goes without saying that these teachers are voters and their students will one day get to vote for the first time. I am sure they will remember what our elected officals in Raleigh did to them. I am certain, I am not alone in my opinion. If you need guidance and advice on balancing the budget, there's a registered Republican in North Carolina who can help you solve the problems that Raleigh cannot seem to get a handle on. Thank you for your time. I look forward to seeing action with results in furthering education in North Carolina and making a real difference in our children's lives.

Comment: All my adult life (I'll be 50 this year) I've always heard we need teachers. We've always had open positions when the new year arrives. Why now are you going to cut those jobs. We need our teachers if we are going to have a future in this state. We need students that can work in a "technical world". Tobacco is long gone for this state. Why do we need the lotery if the moneys can keep our schools moving forward. Wasn't that the point! There are areas that we can cut cost. Let's first look at unnecessary spending. The average family is cutting back why can't our states leaders do the same. Take your lunch instead of catering expenses luncheons. Show us your willing to cut back like we are having to do. My husband was laid-off May 15th, 2008. Only in the last two weeks has he found a temp. job. I've had to return to work after 10 years on disibility just to pay for the cobra premiums which are more than my mortgage premium. Our daughter her husband and baby have had to move in with us. We are all feeling the crushing affects of this economy. But please don't cut our schools they are out hope of a better future not only for our children but for ourselves. There is no dream of retirement now! Try brown bag lunches, video conferences and car pooling.....let's see cut in areas that will not affect our futures. __________________ This same email was sent to the following; Alma.Adams@ncleg.net, John.Blust@ncleg.net, Pricey.Harrison@ncleg.net, Maggie.Jeffus@ncleg.net, Earl.Jones@ncleg.net, Laura.Wiley@ncleg.net, Phil.Berger@ncleg.net, Stan.Bingham@ncleg.net, Katie.Dorsett@ncleg.net, Don.Vaughan@ncleg.net, Rick.Glazier@ncleg.net

Dear Governor Perdue,



It has been brought to my attention that you are considering cuts to Central Office Administrators.  I am requesting that you reject the conference proposal to cut Central Services Allotment.  Central Services is less than 2 % of the states budget. The school system can not provide the necessary support services with 50% cut in state funding.  The cost of administration would shift from the state to the local funding.  Cumberland County Schools does not have available sources of revenue to make up this loss.



I also request that you reject the proposal to shift 50% of the tort claims for buses to the local school systems.  Additional cost to insure our buses would have to be picked up locally which would result in further job losses. 



If Central Services Personnel are cut our children, parents, and employees would greatly suffer.  Here are a few things that will happen:



Our job duties would shift to the schools and their staff has already suffered major cuts.  School bookkeepers, data managers, etc. have enough to do already and do not need the extra work.  Work not shifted back to the schools would have to be shifted to those personnel in the central offices who are already overworked in their job requirements and duties.  This will result in inefficiency in all departments.  Supplies for classrooms will not be ordered, received and in the classroom in a timely manner if purchasing personnel are cut.  We have central service's staff that assist vendors and schools in getting the supplies, equipment and materials that are needed for the students in Cumberland County.  Teachers, bus drivers, cafeteria staff as well as others in the system may suffer some delay in getting paid.  Vendors who we do business with will be delayed in getting payment if Accounts Payable personnel are cut, which in turn will delay payment to the state on e-procurement fees.  Curriculum personnel will not be able to get instructional materials for their students in a timely manner.  The Curriculum Specialist work with the school system to ensure that everyone is using the same materials and this needs to be done so that what is being taught in the classroom is in line with Federal and State guidelines.



There is a certain accountability factor that central services have in performing their job.  Do you want to pass that to the Principals, Assistant Principals, bookkeepers and others at the school level?  These people are not trained in the areas where central services duties and responsibilities lie. 



If you allow these cuts you are pushing North Carolina backwards twenty or thirty years and we will see a decline in North Carolina Public Education.  Federal, state and local goals will not be achieved.  Cumberland County Schools strives to achieve higher goals and accomplishments.  Each year we raise the bar higher and try to achieve those goals at each school as well as at system level. 



I implore you to reject the conference proposal to cut the Central Services allotment and the proposal to shift 50% of the tort claims for buses to local LEA's.



I appreciate your time and consideration.



Sincerely,

Beverly Cannon

Dear Mrs. Knight:



Thank you for your e-mail regarding early childhood education in North Carolina.  Governor Perdue appreciates you taking time express your concerns. Please know that despite these tough economic times, she is focused on protecting education.



You will be happy to learn that the Governor did not include any consolidation of the early education programs in my recent budget proposal, and did not reduce the services that would be provided under these programs.  For further details, please read the budget proposal at:  <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/>www.governor.state.nc.us.



Budget discussions are currently underway in the General Assembly.  We encourage you to continue working with your local legislators to explain your concerns about the consolidation of the programs.  A complete listing of the General Assembly members can be accessed at:  <http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/>http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/ .

Subject: Proposed cut from Smart Start funding

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue I have just received info about a rumor that the HHS conference subcommittee has slashed the Smart Start funding by 28.2M; I do hope this is a rumor only! I am a volunteer for the Dolly Parton Imagination Library initiative in Mitchell County; our committee raises funds for postage to be paid to the Parton Foundation to provide books to our county's children under 5. As we are just volunteers the Mitchell Yancey Partnership for Children [our local Smart Start funded organization] is our sponsor. I also serve on the Partnership's board as a community member. I DO realize the state and our country are under tremendous fiscal restraints and I do know that you all are trying your very best to deal with these problems. May I respectfully suggest that implementing cuts to childrens' programs will only continue the cycle of illiteracy and family problems in our county and state. I suspect that the books our children receive are, in many cases, the only books they may ever see. I realize the proposed cuts do not effect our children receiving their books but the Partnership office is an umbrella 501c for many programs. Our county.as well as most W NC counties, has been ravaged by NAFTA and plant closures. Mitchell County has an unemployment rate of over 13% [possibly more now that our recently opened small furniture factory [Genesis] has shut down]. Please, please, if there is any way to urge the legislators to reconsider this funding cut our children and I will be eternally grateful. Thank you for listening Judith Arnn Knight

Thank you for your letter about the budget crisis and early education.  Governor Perdue appreciates hearing from North Carolina’s engaged citizens.  Education always has been a priority for her, and she shares your concerns about the quality of our children’s education and future.



The Governor is considering each choice very carefully as we work together to get North Carolina back on track.  In these difficult times, we are making some very tough decisions to deal with a nearly $5 billion shortfall.  She will keep your ideas in mind as we work to improve the quality of life in North Carolina.

Hello Gov. Perdue,

                                      My name is Phyllis Austin. I am very concerned about the cuts to our early child care & education programs in N.C. I do understand that these are hard economic times for all Americans. I on the other hand do know how important these programs are to our children, to child care workers, and to the economy in the long run. If you could please read the two letters that I am attaching to this e-mail I would truly appreciate this. I feel if you read these you will have a better understanding of how these programs are so important to us all. I sent these to you in a fax, but felt I might have a better chance for you getting them if I sent them through both systems. I don’t know if my one letter will make a difference but felt so strongly about this that I felt I must try. I know you have a lot on you right now and there is a lot to consider in trying to fix our economy & budget. I do feel that early child care is an important key to keeping jobs and the economy going. I wanted you to know I did get your phone message about supporting more revenue for these programs. I am behind anything we need to support our early child care & education system. I hope you and your staff have a nice day. If you ever want to see what Smart Start, TEACH, and WAGES really do for our young children & child care providers please feel free to visit our center in Haywood County. If you read the two letters I have sent you then you will know why this center is an example of what we need in early child care. Once again have a nice day & thank you for all your hard work.

Subject: Dual enrollment

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, My husband and I have taken on the responsibility; financially and academically, of home educating our children for ten years here in Harnett County, all the while still paying our taxes. This past semester, as a junior in high school, our son was able to take an American History class at Wake Technical Community College. The 'slot' offered to our son was only after the college students had sufficient time to sign up. In other words, he took a place in the class which would have stayed empty anyway. The instructors do not know who is a dual enrollment student and who is not, so all the students must rise to the college level. Books, supplies and other fees are purchased or paid at the regular price as any other student. Students from public, private, or home schools have been able to rely on the community colleges, funded by our taxes, to help fill in areas where we need them. Dual enrollment is an important option which needs to be protected. We need options outside of math and science too. All of these schools: public, private, or home schools, are not able to offer everything, so accelerated students have been able to rely on dual enrollment to fill in where their schools can not afford to offer all classes needed. Having been a public school teacher in North Carolina, we can not afford to eliminate dual enrollment but maybe we can compromise. Instead of eliminating the option of dual enrollment, these three organizations: public, private, or home school, can pay for their classes. It could be a portion of the regular amount or even the full amount but please do not eliminate this choice of dual enrollment. We thank you for your time and we trust you will thoroughly investigate this situation before forming a decision. Sincerely, Chris and Kathy Boerner /Burner/

Might I suggest, that instead of cutting the dual enrollment program cuts be made in the Smart Start, and More at Four programs. 

My experience as a mother and home educator tells me that the later mentioned programs are nothing short of free day care to preschool age children.  Such preschool aged children are the responsibility of the parents, not the government, and should be at home with their parents or in a private day care situation if home care is not an option.

In some situations these "early education" programs are utilized by parents who want nothing more than for someone else to raise their children.  And I am confident in my assumption that these aforementioned programs are a much greater burden on the tax payer than the dual enrollment program. 

How much less would the $5 Billion shortfall be if we were to eliminate the need of extra teachers, transportation and all of the free lunches that is needed when these early education programs are in place.  Dual enrollment students are in classes where extra instructors are not needed, provide their own transportation, and unless we missed out on something, buy their own lunches.

Tax money would be far better spent on a program where the child can be a active participant in futhering their education. 

Sincerely,

Amanda Haskett

I realize that our state is in an economic crisis and that cuts have to be made, but I beg of you to reconsider this recommendation and look elsewhere to balance the budget.  

> There are many courses besides math and science that provide the equivalent of AP courses in such areas as English and Foreign Language.

This would certainly seem to be an efficient way to use the space and at the same time promote higher education to the young people of this state.   

> As a home schooling parent, I, along with numerous others home schooling families across our state, save North Carolina thousands of dollars yearly in public school funding. Dual enrollment programs are important in supplementing our home school curriculum and preparing our children/students for further education. It has been reported that the home school-dual enrollment students have enhanced the positive learning atmosphere of our Community Colleges, in part, due to an appreciative attitude for this opportunity and, in part, due to their overall good conduct encouraged from firmer moral and character discipline by being home schooled.  

> As a proud citizen of the State of North Carolina, one of the best places to live on earth, I beseech you to reconsider this portion of your recommendations. Please leave the dual enrollment programs in place for all of our high school youth. The small adjustment of cutting dual enrollment in the long run would not augment the state’s budget as much as the educational opportunities provided through this program would benefit our state as a whole with better-educated people.

All of us in North Carolina face significant challenges from the national economic crisis - and our state's budget is not immune from these effects.  In fact, our state faces its largest shortfall on record - $4.7 billion.  As legislators attempt to close this enormous gap, we have seen brutal cuts proposed to our children's public edcation.  But in North Carolina we must act boldly to protect the classroom.

> We cannot and must not cripple education.  Cutting the classroom means cutting short our economic future.  That's why Governor Perdue is calling on the General Assembly to make smart, tough cuts in the budget and to raise the revenue necessary to protect our classrooms.  We hope you will join her in the fight to protect public education in North Carolina.

Subject: Taxes and Teachers

Comment: Ms. Perdue, My wife and I received your phone recorded appeal to support the raising of our taxes to secure our Education. Why would you advocate for raising taxes in an economic downturn/recession? We don't have anymore to give! We are stretched as it is. And if "Cap and Trade" is approved, we won't have anymore money to buy anything! It is really sad that as smart as you and the State Legislators are, that you all can't figure out how to keep the Education Budget strong and secure. How about going through the budget (line by line) and cutting out all the "special" projects like museums and community theaters and such things and leave Education alone. What is the point of the "Education" Lottery? -- money in every body's pocket except Education I suppose. If the teachers have more students added to their rooms, less money in their pockets, less Principals, and Support Staff, the students will suffer and the grades will go down. If they go down, there won't be anybody that can read a script for the little theaters and no one will be able to read the information signs at the museums. Please cut the other frivolous items from the budget, lower our taxes, and then you will have all the Education monies we need. But please spend it wisely. Thank you, David and Mary Epley

Gov. Perdue Calls on General Assembly to Protect Public Education in the State Budget

The state is currently facing a record budget shortfall of $4.7 billion.  Legislators are working hard to close the enormous gap, but there have been brutal cuts proposed to public education.  Cuts proposed so far to education are troubling: increases in class size and elimination of more than 6,000 thousand teachers and thousands more teaching assistants.

Gov. Perdue this week continued to call on the General Assembly to make smart, tough cuts in the budget and to raise the revenue necessary to protect our classrooms.  She held rallies in Wilmington and Greenville on Monday and released a video message on Tuesday.

Gov. Perdue Launches "United We Serve" Campaign

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that the Governor’s Office and the state’s departments and agencies will participate in United We Serve, a national effort launched by President Obama to engage more Americans in serving their communities this summer.

“These 11 weeks are a time for North Carolinians to take the lead in organizing service projects and forging partnerships with local organizations to get their communities back on track,” Perdue said. “Whether you are working in a soup kitchen, reading to a child or helping out a friend in need, everyone’s small efforts can create some big results.”

The campaign kicks off June 22 and runs through September 11, which will be marked for the first time as a national day of service and remembrance.  The initiative focuses on four key areas: education, health, community renewal, and energy and the environment.  It is being led by the Corporation for National and Community Service, a federal agency that improves lives and strengthens communities through volunteering and service.

The governor will focus on mentoring during the summer of service campaign.  Cabinet secretaries will volunteer with different nonprofits and advocacy groups throughout the summer as well.  The governor also encourages state employees to use their allotted 24 community service hours in support of the initiative and to help get North Carolina back on track.

The Obama administration created <http://www.serve.gov/>www.serve.gov, a Web site that allows visitors to find local volunteer opportunities by typing in their zip code and allows organizations to recruit volunteers by posting their projects.

Federal Energy Department OKs NC Plan to Use Recovery Fund to Create Green Jobs, Save Energy

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that the U.S. Energy Department has approved North Carolina’s $75.9 million Energy Plan to improve energy efficiency, promote greater use of renewable energy resources and create more green jobs.  The program will be funded through the state’s share of federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds.

“With this approval, North Carolina is prepared to quickly move ahead to create jobs and position our state to become a national leader in green energy,” said Gov. Perdue.  “I have directed the State Energy Office and other agencies to move as fast as possible to put these funds to work creating jobs and building North Carolina’s green economy.”

Through ARRA funding to the State Energy Program, North Carolina is significantly increasing its investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy, building its sustainable energy economy and workforce and promoting innovation and development of new energy technologies and resources.

The federal Energy Department has given the state the go-ahead to start the program and spend $30.4 million.  The state will receive the remaining funds as it shows it has successfully implemented the plan.

North Carolina is focusing on six areas for federal Recovery Act State Energy Program:

- Supporting small businesses and industry through energy savings, 
- Growing North Carolina’s green workforce through JobsNow, 
- Developing an Energy Investment Revolving Loan Fund, 
- Improving government energy efficiency, 
- Promoting residential energy efficiency and renewable energy, and 
- Fostering renewable energy technology and resource innovation.

“We will increase our energy efficiency, use new and emerging technologies; and develop creative partnerships with the private and nonprofit sectors,” Gov. Perdue said.

Take Your Dog To Work Day

Today, June 26, is "Take Your Dog To Work Day."  The day was created to celebrate the great companions dogs make and to encourage pet adoptions.  Gov. Perdue was happy to participate.


Today she brought North Carolina's First Dogs, Dosie and Zipper, to work.  You can read more about these two Tibetan Terriers on <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstFamily/dosieZipper.aspx>their webpage.

31 Highway Contracts Awarded, Including 11 Recovery Projects

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that 31 contracts totaling $73 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including 11 projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The contracts were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.

“All of these projects will help generate new jobs and economic development for North Carolina, as well as improve travel throughout our state,” Perdue said.

According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.

The 11 recovery projects awarded are located in Bertie, Davidson, Davie, Durham, Franklin, Granville, Guilford, Lee, Stokes, Transylvania and Watauga counties. The 20 other projects awarded are located in Anson, Buncombe, Cabarrus, Catawba, Cumberland, Granville, Henderson, Iredell, Lincoln, Madison, Mecklenburg, Mitchell, New Hanover, Polk, Sampson, Stanly, Transylvania, Warren and Yancey counties. Work on all contracts will start in July.

Cleveland County Manufacturer to Add 114 Jobs

Baldor Electric Co., an international supplier of industrial electric motors, mechanical power transmission products, drives and generators, will expand its Kings Mountain operations.  The company plans to invest more than $12.2 million and create 114 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $157,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

“North Carolina’s manufacturing sector remains strong and diverse,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Our state is attractive to growing companies because of our highly skilled workforce, business-friendly climate and tremendous quality of life.”

Baldor Electric Co., headquartered in Arkansas, operates 26 manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada, England, Mexico and China and provides products to more than 70 countries. Three of the company’s plants are in North Carolina, in Kings Mountain, Marion and Weaverville, employing a combined workforce of nearly 700 people.

Baldor is consolidating operations from South Carolina and moving those manufacturing processes to facilities in other states, including the Kings Mountain plant, which currently employs more than 500 workers.  The 114 new jobs added over the next three years will pay an average wage of $38,329, not including benefits, which is higher than the Cleveland County average of $31,720.

Dear Mrs. Blue:



Thank you for your e-mail regarding the difficulties your daughter has experienced with her online class at Overhills High School in Harnett County. I hope you have been able to find resolution at this point.  If you have not, you may want to talk with Dr. Nancy Holmes, Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction in the Harnett County School system.  She can be reached at 910-893-8151.



Each school system has the responsibility for having policies in place to protect their school, students and teachers.  Governor Perdue is committed to making schools a place where students feel challenged, supported and safe.



Thank you again for sharing your important education concerns with our office.

Subject: Overhills High School Administration

Comment: Governor Perdue, I know that the school year is over, but I am a concerned parent that is still seeking a solution to a serious problem that I feel was not handled fairly. My daughter, a rising senior, was having problems with Overhills administration the last four months of the 2008-2009 school year. This is a very long story but I will try my best to make a long story short. It all started because my daughter's facilitator, for an online class through the UNC-G ischool program, was having problems because she was not interacting and participating in class. I could not see the problem because it was an online class with everyone taking something different. It got to the point that myself and my daughter's father was having meetings with the teacher, assistant principal, and then the principal. Instead of things getting better things got worst, the facilitator would get in her face as a way to provoke her and cause unnecessary problems. It got to the point where my daughter didn't want to go to class. She would go to school, sit in the library for her first period (which was the online class), and then proceed to the rest of her classes (needless to say she ended up failing this class). Instead of trying to find out why this honor student was not attending class and sitting in the library, their only solution was ISS (In School Suspension) not once but many times and even suspension. We kept going to the school, still talking to the principal, and still going no where. We were trying to find a solution to the problem, every solution that we suggested the principal turned down, so from there we requested a meeting with the facilitator, assistant pricipal, and the principal but the principal refused. At this point we took it to the Board Of Education, we were told from them that the only thing that they could do was to notify the facilitator that their was a complaint against her (when the facilitator found out there was a complaint against her she began to act vindictive towards my daughter). For me this just was not good enough with the administrators at Overhills knowing that this was an ongoing situation that just was not being solved, and with the principal telling myself and my child that it was my daughter's fault and you can't believe what the students at this school tells you, this made my daughter feel like there was no one she could turn to at school. Then the Board Of Education suggested that my daughter take college classes at Central Carolina Community College such as Cosmetology (what an insult to an already bad situation), why would my daughter take classes at a community college when the UNC-G ischool program was being offered through the school? When the school year was coming to an end, the facilitator and the principal says that we were just mad because our daughter failed this class and that there was nothing they could do because it was the end of the school year, my question was what was their excuse when we were trying to resolve this issue months ago? The administrators were not realizing that the events that took place is what led her to failing this class needless to say the frustration from this one class caused my daughter to fail other classes. I still didn't feel like anything was being solved because the administrators at Overhills and the Board Of Education did not step up and take action to see what the problem was, so I contacted Congressman Bob Etheridge and told him our problem and he contacted the Superintendent at the Board Of Education. The Superintendent called me and told me that Cogressman Etheridge had contacted him and he told me that Congressman Etheridge was not over the school system so my question is "who is?" The Superintendent passed this situation down to the Assistant Superintendent and she is allowing my daughter to make up those classes and I am very appreciative of that, but I feel as though nothing was handled on the administrative end. My whole point to this is that I feel that the school system has let my daughter down. Where was the voice (besides her parents) for the student. I just cannot believe that a solution could not have come from this problem that led my daughter from loving to go to school to dreading to go. I would really like a meeting with Governor Perude, because it is more to the story that I could not sum up. I feel like even though the school year is over the situation was not handled fairly, and I want to raise awarness because I know if this happened to my child it has happened with other parents and their child. I want this situation resolved immediately because I don't want this issue carrying over to my daughter's senior year. My thing is everyone wants to talk about education, but no one wants to deal with the issues that is going on in the school system. Thanks, Stephaine Blue Contact Information: Home: (910)893-8025 Cell: (910)890-5925 Work: (910)892-7811

Honorable Governor Perdue,

Your message requesting Public Education Funding confuses me.  Didn’t you take the Education Lottery money away from education just after you took office?  What was that money used for?  If the schools needed it why did you take it?  Certainly, as a parent of a school aged child this is a concern and tugs at my heart strings but makes no sense to me.  You even accepted the dreaded stimulus money with so many strings attached we will probably never break free.  Where is that going?  By accepting that money, we sold our souls to the Federal government and we still do not have enough money for our schools?  Please help me understand.  It feels like a “shell game” to me.

Respectfully,

Ruth Goss

31 Highway Contracts Awarded, Including 11 Recovery Projects

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that 31 contracts totaling $73 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including 11 projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The contracts were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.

“All of these projects will help generate new jobs and economic development for North Carolina, as well as improve travel throughout our state,” Perdue said.

According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.

The 11 recovery projects awarded are located in Bertie, Davidson, Davie, Durham, Franklin, Granville, Guilford, Lee, Stokes, Transylvania and Watauga counties. The 20 other projects awarded are located in Anson, Buncombe, Cabarrus, Catawba, Cumberland, Granville, Henderson, Iredell, Lincoln, Madison, Mecklenburg, Mitchell, New Hanover, Polk, Sampson, Stanly, Transylvania, Warren and Yancey counties. Work on all contracts will start in July.

Cleveland County Manufacturer to Add 114 Jobs

Baldor Electric Co., an international supplier of industrial electric motors, mechanical power transmission products, drives and generators, will expand its Kings Mountain operations.  The company plans to invest more than $12.2 million and create 114 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $157,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

“North Carolina’s manufacturing sector remains strong and diverse,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Our state is attractive to growing companies because of our highly skilled workforce, business-friendly climate and tremendous quality of life.”

Baldor Electric Co., headquartered in Arkansas, operates 26 manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada, England, Mexico and China and provides products to more than 70 countries. Three of the company’s plants are in North Carolina, in Kings Mountain, Marion and Weaverville, employing a combined workforce of nearly 700 people.

Baldor is consolidating operations from South Carolina and moving those manufacturing processes to facilities in other states, including the Kings Mountain plant, which currently employs more than 500 workers.  The 114 new jobs added over the next three years will pay an average wage of $38,329, not including benefits, which is higher than the Cleveland County average of $31,720.

Comment: So, we need to all agree to pay more taxes so we can keep basic services like teachers for our children? What a joke. Why don't you fund a teacher vs. another folly of a social engineering project? I think the teachers need funding and are excellent....hmmm maybe we would be better served to keep them employed vs government handouts? What a unique idea, I keep my paycheck and you and the your fellow democrats (sOcialist) stay out of the way and keep yours? Best regards..

Dear Ms. Hoff:



Thank you for your letter regarding the use NC Education Lottery dollars.  The Governor appreciates hearing from constituents who are concerned about the educational welfare of our state’s youth.



 The North Carolina Education Lottery was established to ensure we are providing high quality pre-kindergarten for at-risk four-year-olds, smaller classes in grades K-3, and funding for critical school construction needs in fast-growing and low-wealth counties, as well as college scholarships. For more information on how lottery dollars are spent, please visit their website at: <http://www.nc-educationlottery.org/>http://www.nc-educationlottery.org/  and click on “Where the Money Goes”.



Thank you again for writing and sharing your perspective on this important issue.

Subject: Education Budgets

Comment: Governor Purdue: First off I know some of these questions and concerns that I have you were not the person making the decisions the last eight years. I have several questions and hope that you can answer them for me. 1. Where is the money for the Lottery going? Is 100% of it for education. I feel that we have been mislead by certain senators in this state. 2. What about e-procurement. Each vendor who is registered is paying 1.75%. Is the state getting any of that money or is it all going to the company that is running the software program. 3. I think at times our legislation does not think seriously of some of the votes and bills that are the table. What can we do besides voting them out when they come up for re-election. 4. What efforts are being done to control illegals in this state. We have so many and they have the same rights and priviledges as we do. I have no problem with someone getting food stamps or social security it they have worked and paid taxes and have paid into the social security system. I would greatly appreciate it if the above questions could be answered. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. Pamela S. Hoff

Gov. Perdue Rallies to Protect the Classroom

Governor Perdue today in Raleigh kicked off a series of rallies across North Carolina to protect public schools in the state budget.

Below are selected excerpts from her prepared remarks:
“In the last few months North Carolina has been hit by the deepest national crisis in our lifetimes. I’m told we have one of the largest shortfalls in America. It is the largest shortfall in our history – $4.7 billion next year and even more the following year.” …
“I applaud the General Assembly for their work to put a budget together. But – and that’s a big word – in North Carolina we must act boldly to protect the classroom.” …
“We cannot and must not cripple education. Cutting education means cutting short our economic future.” …
“That’s why today I call on the General Assembly to make smart, tough cuts in the budget and to raise the revenue necessary to protect North Carolina’s classrooms.” …
“We will cut deep. We will do more with less. But as state leaders we cannot increase class size, we cannot lay off teachers and we cannot sacrifice our economic future.”

Additional rallies will be held in Greensboro, Charlotte, Asheville, Greenville and Wilmington.

Dear Mrs. Revels:



Thank you for your letter about the Governor Morehead School.  Governor Perdue appreciates hearing from North Carolina’s engaged citizens.  Education always has been a priority for her, and she shares your concerns about the quality of our children’s education and future.



The Governor is considering each choice very carefully as we work together to get North Carolina back on track.  In these difficult times, we are making some very tough decisions to deal with a nearly $5 billion shortfall.  She will keep your ideas in mind as we work to improve the quality of life in North Carolina.

Comment: How could you even consider closing the Governor Morehead School? Why don't you take the $1.00 a day to girls to not get pregnant program and all these other silly programs that are worthless and use that money for the GMSchool. I am proud for my tax dollars to go to the GMschool. I am disgusted when you send my tax dollars to children and parents that have no morals and do not care about bettering themselves. Do you even have any idea of right and wrong? It is wrong to take my tax money and waste it. You should have to publish a list that shows were all the tax money is spent in detail. Please let me know where I can get this list. I know you think I am an unimportant person, but that is where you are wrong. We important tax payers are finally going to ban together to take politicians out of office who ignore our wishes while spending our money. I am so sorry for this great state.

Thank you for your e-mail regarding early childhood education in North Carolina.  Governor Perdue appreciates you taking time express your concerns. Please know that despite these tough economic times, she is focused on protecting education.



Over the years, the More at Four program has been nationally recognized for its success.   You will be happy to learn that the Governor did not include any consolidation of the early education programs in my recent budget proposal, and did not reduce the services that would be provided under these programs.  For further details, please read the budget proposal at:  <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/>www.governor.state.nc.us .



Budget discussions are currently underway in the General Assembly.  We encourage you to continue working with your local legislators to explain your concerns about the consolidation of the programs.  A complete listing of the General Assembly members can be accessed at:  <http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/>http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/ .



Thank you all for contacting our office.  We appreciate your advocacy for education.

Gov. Perdue Calls on General Assembly to Protect Public Education in the State Budget

The state is currently facing a record budget shortfall of $4.7 billion.  Legislators are working hard to close the enormous gap, but there have been brutal cuts proposed to public education.  Cuts proposed so far to education are troubling: increases in class size and elimination of more than 6,000 thousand teachers and thousands more teaching assistants.

Gov. Perdue this week continued to call on the General Assembly to make smart, tough cuts in the budget and to raise the revenue necessary to protect our classrooms.  She held rallies in Wilmington and Greenville on Monday and released a video message on Tuesday.

Gov. Perdue Launches "United We Serve" Campaign

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that the Governor’s Office and the state’s departments and agencies will participate in United We Serve, a national effort launched by President Obama to engage more Americans in serving their communities this summer.

“These 11 weeks are a time for North Carolinians to take the lead in organizing service projects and forging partnerships with local organizations to get their communities back on track,” Perdue said. “Whether you are working in a soup kitchen, reading to a child or helping out a friend in need, everyone’s small efforts can create some big results.”

The campaign kicks off June 22 and runs through September 11, which will be marked for the first time as a national day of service and remembrance.  The initiative focuses on four key areas: education, health, community renewal, and energy and the environment.  It is being led by the Corporation for National and Community Service, a federal agency that improves lives and strengthens communities through volunteering and service.

The governor will focus on mentoring during the summer of service campaign.  Cabinet secretaries will volunteer with different nonprofits and advocacy groups throughout the summer as well.  The governor also encourages state employees to use their allotted 24 community service hours in support of the initiative and to help get North Carolina back on track.

The Obama administration created <http://www.serve.gov/>www.serve.gov, a Web site that allows visitors to find local volunteer opportunities by typing in their zip code and allows organizations to recruit volunteers by posting their projects.

Federal Energy Department OKs NC Plan to Use Recovery Fund to Create Green Jobs, Save Energy

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that the U.S. Energy Department has approved North Carolina’s $75.9 million Energy Plan to improve energy efficiency, promote greater use of renewable energy resources and create more green jobs.  The program will be funded through the state’s share of federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds.

“With this approval, North Carolina is prepared to quickly move ahead to create jobs and position our state to become a national leader in green energy,” said Gov. Perdue.  “I have directed the State Energy Office and other agencies to move as fast as possible to put these funds to work creating jobs and building North Carolina’s green economy.”

Through ARRA funding to the State Energy Program, North Carolina is significantly increasing its investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy, building its sustainable energy economy and workforce and promoting innovation and development of new energy technologies and resources.

The federal Energy Department has given the state the go-ahead to start the program and spend $30.4 million.  The state will receive the remaining funds as it shows it has successfully implemented the plan.

North Carolina is focusing on six areas for federal Recovery Act State Energy Program:

- Supporting small businesses and industry through energy savings, 
- Growing North Carolina’s green workforce through JobsNow, 
- Developing an Energy Investment Revolving Loan Fund, 
- Improving government energy efficiency, 
- Promoting residential energy efficiency and renewable energy, and 
- Fostering renewable energy technology and resource innovation.

“We will increase our energy efficiency, use new and emerging technologies; and develop creative partnerships with the private and nonprofit sectors,” Gov. Perdue said.

Take Your Dog To Work Day

Today, June 26, is "Take Your Dog To Work Day."  The day was created to celebrate the great companions dogs make and to encourage pet adoptions.  Gov. Perdue was happy to participate.


Today she brought North Carolina's First Dogs, Dosie and Zipper, to work.  You can read more about these two Tibetan Terriers on <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstFamily/dosieZipper.aspx>their webpage.

31 Highway Contracts Awarded, Including 11 Recovery Projects

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that 31 contracts totaling $73 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including 11 projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The contracts were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.

“All of these projects will help generate new jobs and economic development for North Carolina, as well as improve travel throughout our state,” Perdue said.

According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.

The 11 recovery projects awarded are located in Bertie, Davidson, Davie, Durham, Franklin, Granville, Guilford, Lee, Stokes, Transylvania and Watauga counties. The 20 other projects awarded are located in Anson, Buncombe, Cabarrus, Catawba, Cumberland, Granville, Henderson, Iredell, Lincoln, Madison, Mecklenburg, Mitchell, New Hanover, Polk, Sampson, Stanly, Transylvania, Warren and Yancey counties. Work on all contracts will start in July.

Cleveland County Manufacturer to Add 114 Jobs

Baldor Electric Co., an international supplier of industrial electric motors, mechanical power transmission products, drives and generators, will expand its Kings Mountain operations.  The company plans to invest more than $12.2 million and create 114 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $157,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

“North Carolina’s manufacturing sector remains strong and diverse,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Our state is attractive to growing companies because of our highly skilled workforce, business-friendly climate and tremendous quality of life.”

Baldor Electric Co., headquartered in Arkansas, operates 26 manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada, England, Mexico and China and provides products to more than 70 countries. Three of the company’s plants are in North Carolina, in Kings Mountain, Marion and Weaverville, employing a combined workforce of nearly 700 people.

Baldor is consolidating operations from South Carolina and moving those manufacturing processes to facilities in other states, including the Kings Mountain plant, which currently employs more than 500 workers.  The 114 new jobs added over the next three years will pay an average wage of $38,329, not including benefits, which is higher than the Cleveland County average of $31,720.

Dear Ms. Basloe:



Thank you for your e-mail regarding early childhood education in North Carolina.  Governor Perdue appreciates you taking time express your concerns. Please know that despite these tough economic times, she is focused on protecting education.



Over the years, the More at Four program has been nationally recognized for its success.   You will be happy to learn that the Governor did not include any consolidation of the early education programs in my recent budget proposal, and did not reduce the services that would be provided under these programs.  For further details, please read the budget proposal at:  <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/>www.governor.state.nc.us .



Budget discussions are currently underway in the General Assembly.  We encourage you to continue working with your local legislators to explain your concerns about the consolidation of the programs.  A complete listing of the General Assembly members can be accessed at:  <http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/>http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/ .



Thank you all for contacting our office.  We appreciate your advocacy for education.

Subject: Please remember that education begins at Birth. Smart Start and Early childhood must be supported if we are to build the future.
Importance: High



Dear Governor Perdue,



If we are not for the young children, then who are we for? The young children today are the future. A young child’s brain develops 80% by age 3, 90% by age 5. If we do not support early childhood education, we will have lost the opportunity to impact thousands of children, children who would have the potential to lead our state in the future.



As the “mother of Smart Start,” please support Smart Start to ensure that we can make a difference. If we cannot provide the important services to have children ready for school, the schools will not be able to make up the problems that will arise from this lack of preparedness. The foundation of all education happens in the birth – 5 years!



Please ensure our fiscal accountability by keeping the audits to Smart Start in the Office of the State Auditor.



Please support our local efforts to provide funds to the most pressing needs for young children and their families in our communities. The damage to these vulnerable babies today if we are not able to provide needed support will result in major problems in the future for our state and country.



Thank you for caring about our youngest children,

Marsha Basloe

Dear Mr. Probert:

Thank you for your letter regarding the duties of the North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction.

On Monday, January 26th, I announced a re-organization of the education leadership structure in our state that involves the Chairman of the State Board of Education and the Deputy State Superintendent. Prior to my announcement, these were separate positions and my actions consolidated the roles into a single position to more effectively and efficiently manage public education.  Essentially, I deleted the position of the Deputy State Superintendent and combined the powers and duties of that job with the roles of the former Chairman. I requested the State Board of Education redefine the duties of its chair to include the responsibilities of the newly created Chief Executive Officer, who will manage operations of the public school system.   At the March 4, 2009 State Board of Education meeting, Dr. Bill Harrison was sworn in as the new Chairman and CEO.

My announcement does not change the responsibilities and duties of the elected State Superintendent, Dr. June Atkinson. As the State Superintendent, Dr. Atkinson serves a key role as the ambassador and champion for public education.   In addition, I also asked her to head up a statewide blue-ribbon task force on career development and workforce issues that are critical to the economic and educational backbone of the state. 

Again, thank you for writing and sharing your concerns.

> Gov. Perdue Calls on General Assembly to Protect Public Education in the State Budget

The state is currently facing a record budget shortfall of $4.7 billion.  Legislators are working hard to close the enormous gap, but there have been brutal cuts proposed to public education.  Cuts proposed so far to education are troubling: increases in class size and elimination of more than 6,000 thousand teachers and thousands more teaching assistants.

> Gov. Perdue this week continued to call on the General Assembly to make smart, tough cuts in the budget and to raise the revenue necessary to protect our classrooms.  She held rallies in Wilmington and Greenville on Monday and released a video message on Tuesday.

> Gov. Perdue Launches "United We Serve" Campaign

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that the Governor’s Office and the state’s departments and agencies will participate in United We Serve, a national effort launched by President Obama to engage more Americans in serving their communities this summer.

> “These 11 weeks are a time for North Carolinians to take the lead in organizing service projects and forging partnerships with local organizations to get their communities back on track,” Perdue said. “Whether you are working in a soup kitchen, reading to a child or helping out a friend in need, everyone’s small efforts can create some big results.”

> The campaign kicks off June 22 and runs through September 11, which will be marked for the first time as a national day of service and remembrance.  The initiative focuses on four key areas: education, health, community renewal, and energy and the environment.  It is being led by the Corporation for National and Community Service, a federal agency that improves lives and strengthens communities through volunteering and service.

> The governor will focus on mentoring during the summer of service campaign.  Cabinet secretaries will volunteer with different nonprofits and advocacy groups throughout the summer as well.  The governor also encourages state employees to use their allotted 24 community service hours in support of the initiative and to help get North Carolina back on track.

> The Obama administration created <http://www.serve.gov/>www.serve.gov, a Web site that allows visitors to find local volunteer opportunities by typing in their zip code and allows organizations to recruit volunteers by posting their projects.

> Federal Energy Department OKs NC Plan to Use Recovery Fund to Create Green Jobs, Save Energy

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that the U.S. Energy Department has approved North Carolina’s $75.9 million Energy Plan to improve energy efficiency, promote greater use of renewable energy resources and create more green jobs.  The program will be funded through the state’s share of federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds.

> “With this approval, North Carolina is prepared to quickly move ahead to create jobs and position our state to become a national leader in green energy,” said Gov. Perdue.  “I have directed the State Energy Office and other agencies to move as fast as possible to put these funds to work creating jobs and building North Carolina’s green economy.”

> Through ARRA funding to the State Energy Program, North Carolina is significantly increasing its investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy, building its sustainable energy economy and workforce and promoting innovation and development of new energy technologies and resources.

> The federal Energy Department has given the state the go-ahead to start the program and spend $30.4 million.  The state will receive the remaining funds as it shows it has successfully implemented the plan.

> North Carolina is focusing on six areas for federal Recovery Act State Energy Program:

> - Supporting small businesses and industry through energy savings, 
> - Growing North Carolina’s green workforce through JobsNow, 
> - Developing an Energy Investment Revolving Loan Fund, 
> - Improving government energy efficiency, 
> - Promoting residential energy efficiency and renewable energy, and 
> - Fostering renewable energy technology and resource innovation.

> “We will increase our energy efficiency, use new and emerging technologies; and develop creative partnerships with the private and nonprofit sectors,” Gov. Perdue said.

> Take Your Dog To Work Day

Today, June 26, is "Take Your Dog To Work Day."  The day was created to celebrate the great companions dogs make and to encourage pet adoptions.  Gov. Perdue was happy to participate.

> Today she brought North Carolina's First Dogs, Dosie and Zipper, to work.  You can read more about these two Tibetan Terriers on <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstFamily/dosieZipper.aspx>their webpage.

> 31 Highway Contracts Awarded, Including 11 Recovery Projects

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that 31 contracts totaling $73 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including 11 projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The contracts were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.

> “All of these projects will help generate new jobs and economic development for North Carolina, as well as improve travel throughout our state,” Perdue said.

> According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.

> The 11 recovery projects awarded are located in Bertie, Davidson, Davie, Durham, Franklin, Granville, Guilford, Lee, Stokes, Transylvania and Watauga counties. The 20 other projects awarded are located in Anson, Buncombe, Cabarrus, Catawba, Cumberland, Granville, Henderson, Iredell, Lincoln, Madison, Mecklenburg, Mitchell, New Hanover, Polk, Sampson, Stanly, Transylvania, Warren and Yancey counties. Work on all contracts will start in July.

> For a list of the projects and for more information visit <http://ncrecovery.gov/News/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=42>NCRecovery.gov.

> Cleveland County Manufacturer to Add 114 Jobs

Baldor Electric Co., an international supplier of industrial electric motors, mechanical power transmission products, drives and generators, will expand its Kings Mountain operations.  The company plans to invest more than $12.2 million and create 114 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $157,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

> “North Carolina’s manufacturing sector remains strong and diverse,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Our state is attractive to growing companies because of our highly skilled workforce, business-friendly climate and tremendous quality of life.”

> Baldor Electric Co., headquartered in Arkansas, operates 26 manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada, England, Mexico and China and provides products to more than 70 countries. Three of the company’s plants are in North Carolina, in Kings Mountain, Marion and Weaverville, employing a combined workforce of nearly 700 people.

> Baldor is consolidating operations from South Carolina and moving those manufacturing processes to facilities in other states, including the Kings Mountain plant, which currently employs more than 500 workers.  The 114 new jobs added over the next three years will pay an average wage of $38,329, not including benefits, which is higher than the Cleveland County average of $31,720.

Subject: Education budget and Literacy Coach positions

Comment: What is being done to protect the Literacy Coach positions from being cut? I was asked to commit 3-5 years to this program. I left a wonderful job with a wonderful team at a wonderful school. Now I hear one and a half years into the training that we will most likely be cut from funding. I have spent hundreds of hours away from my family in training and left a great position to be told that now I just have to look at the job postings available in my county to see IF there is anything available in my licensure area. I have to say that as the pregnant sole provider for my family of four, that is more that a little disappointing. I have kept my end of the Memorandum of Understanding that I had to sign to commit to this program, but the state is not sticking to their end. I have done a fantastic job in my position. You can ask my principal and look at my school's progress over the last year alone. I am not the only one being left without options for a job that is supposed to begin again in just a few weeks. I just want to know who is standing up for me and the other coaches who were asked to go through a stringent interview process, complete about 400 hours of training with products due, and still make progress in our schools within a year? I have written to MANY house and senate representatives, but I have heard back from only a handful. Who is representing us and sticking to the bargain made, and what are they doing to make sure that the commitment is honored from the state's end? I would really like to hear from someone about this issue. Thanks so much, Robin Hevner Literacy Coach Archdale-Trinity Middle School

My growth and new methods have allowed me to pass on to my students my new found technology and information. I encourage my fellow teachers on a daily basis to attempt the national board process. Please help us keep North Carolina on the right path to bring public education to the top in comparison to other states. I hope you will utilize any resources that you have available to you to ensure that this process remains funded. Sincerely, Terri McCumbee 7042631664

Comment: Dear Ms. Perdue: I am very upset to learn that the teacher's assistants in my son's AUIII class were fired today. I do not understand how his IEP will be implemented in 3 weeks, when school starts again, without teacher's assistants in the classroom to help. There is no way the teacher can help 8 special needs children by himself in this class. It is my understanding that this was not happening in just his class but county wide. It is so stressful to have a child with special needs on a daily basis but to add to my stress by hearing this news today is very upseting. I thought you were going to help our schools. This is NOT helping. Please let me know what is going on? Is there a plan, I would love to know about it so I can help my child adjust to the changes to come. 1-919-267-4324

Dear Ms. Formyduval:



Thank you for your letter about the National Boards.  Governor Perdue appreciates hearing from North Carolina’s engaged citizens.  Education always has been a priority for her, and she shares your concerns about the quality of our children’s education and future.



The Governor is considering each choice very carefully as we work together to get North Carolina back on track.  In these difficult times, we are making some very tough decisions to deal with a nearly $5 billion shortfall.  She will keep your ideas in mind as we work to improve the quality of life in North Carolina.

Subject: Extend Retired/ Reemployed Provision

Comment: I am a retired Family and Consumer Science (FACS) teacher who has returned to work in three North Carolina school systems since I retired in 2005 due to the critical need and shortage of certified teachers in my certification area of FACS. In 2007-08, after I retired, I completed the National Board for Professional Teaching Certification process in NC and met the high standards of National Board. I would like to thank you for giving me that opportunity and hope you continue to support the NBCT certification process financially in NC. As a new National Board Certified Teacher, I am available to teach in North Carolina or other states where needed for years to come until 2021 with credit from National Board Certification added to my current certificate. Even though I am also qualified to transport my certification to other states that accept NBCT certification like South Carolina, I prefer to work in NC where needed and where I have taught my entire career. Iencourage legislators to extend the sunset on the retired/reemployed provision for teachers in North Carolina. Please give Local Education Agencies (LEAs) the flexibility to hire retired teachers exempt from an earnings cap because LEAs will find it impossible to fill all positions with certified teachers if retired teachers cannot be reemployed. There will still be shortages in some areas like mine. If this provision is not extended in the law, a retired teacher who is needed would not be able to complete the school year “under the cap” for the remainder of the school year because of an earnings cap. The retired/reemployed provision expires on October 1 and needs to be renewed as soon as possible. I understand there are concerns about non-retired teachers who may be laid off due to the budget cuts being unable to find a job. However, local LEA Reduction in Force (RIF) policies and hiring practices would give the teachers losing their jobs due to budget cuts the first opportunity to transfer for a vacant position if they are certified for the position. Then, if vacancies still exist, they would be posted and applicants interviewed. Local, state, and federal funds are involved in paying employees so it would be unfortunate if North Carolina prohibited school systems from hiring needed retired teachers with those funds or a combination of those funds where they need highly qualified teachers. Local LEAs are presently waiting on the Legislature’s budget to be approved before plans can be made for placement of personnel if moves are necessary and hiring for the 2009-10 school year vacancies is needed. As deliberations continue, the school systems have not been able to let their current employees know their employment status for next year much less advertise vacancies for 2009-10 so it will be a short window of time to fill vacancies this year. I appreciate your consideration of my request and hope you realize the bottom line is the impact teachers have on NC’s students. North Carolina has prided itself on providing our students with highly qualified teachers and a budget crisis should not be the reason NC stops doing that. To strap NC school systems from hiring highly qualified North Carolina trained retired teachers would dismiss an opportunity that would lessen the quality of our schools and our children’s education. Just like we saw a recent film that was to come to Wilmington go to another state because of a law, the same will happen to our NC retired teachers who could be a very valuable resource where needed in NC. Do we really want other states to entice them across the border when we need them in NC? Sincerely, Theresa Formyduval, BS, MEd, NBCT Family and Consumer Science Teacher 910-641-1507

Dear Ms. Fuller:



Thank you for sharing your concerns about public education and the North Carolina budget. We appreciate hearing from citizens. Please know that protecting education is one of Governor Perdue’s top priorities. 



On March 17, 2009, the Governor presented the 2009-2011 proposed budget.  For a detailed view of the Biennial Budget, you may wish to visit: <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/budget.aspx>http://www.governor.state.nc.us/budget.aspx.   She did not propose an increase in class size or teacher lay offs.  In fact, her budget calls for increased funding for the classroom.  The final decision for the balanced budget will be in the hands of the legislators over the next few months.  We encourage you to speak with your representatives in the NC General Assembly and follow the budget process as it develops by visiting <http://www.ncleg.net/>www.ncleg.net .



Thank you again for contacting our office and for all you do for the children of North Carolina.

Gov. Perdue Calls on General Assembly to Protect Public Education in the State Budget

The state is currently facing a record budget shortfall of $4.7 billion.  Legislators are working hard to close the enormous gap, but there have been brutal cuts proposed to public education.  Cuts proposed so far to education are troubling: increases in class size and elimination of more than 6,000 thousand teachers and thousands more teaching assistants.

Gov. Perdue this week continued to call on the General Assembly to make smart, tough cuts in the budget and to raise the revenue necessary to protect our classrooms.  She held rallies in Wilmington and Greenville on Monday and released a video message on Tuesday.

Please join Gov. Perdue in her fight to protect our classrooms!  Contact <http://www.ncleg.net/GIS/RandR07/Representation.html>your legislators and tell them to protect public education in the state budget.

Gov. Perdue Launches "United We Serve" Campaign

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that the Governor’s Office and the state’s departments and agencies will participate in United We Serve, a national effort launched by President Obama to engage more Americans in serving their communities this summer.

“These 11 weeks are a time for North Carolinians to take the lead in organizing service projects and forging partnerships with local organizations to get their communities back on track,” Perdue said. “Whether you are working in a soup kitchen, reading to a child or helping out a friend in need, everyone’s small efforts can create some big results.”

The campaign kicks off June 22 and runs through September 11, which will be marked for the first time as a national day of service and remembrance.  The initiative focuses on four key areas: education, health, community renewal, and energy and the environment.  It is being led by the Corporation for National and Community Service, a federal agency that improves lives and strengthens communities through volunteering and service.

The governor will focus on mentoring during the summer of service campaign.  Cabinet secretaries will volunteer with different nonprofits and advocacy groups throughout the summer as well.  The governor also encourages state employees to use their allotted 24 community service hours in support of the initiative and to help get North Carolina back on track.

The Obama administration created <http://www.serve.gov/>www.serve.gov, a Web site that allows visitors to find local volunteer opportunities by typing in their zip code and allows organizations to recruit volunteers by posting their projects.

Federal Energy Department OKs NC Plan to Use Recovery Fund to Create Green Jobs, Save Energy

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that the U.S. Energy Department has approved North Carolina’s $75.9 million Energy Plan to improve energy efficiency, promote greater use of renewable energy resources and create more green jobs.  The program will be funded through the state’s share of federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds.

“With this approval, North Carolina is prepared to quickly move ahead to create jobs and position our state to become a national leader in green energy,” said Gov. Perdue.  “I have directed the State Energy Office and other agencies to move as fast as possible to put these funds to work creating jobs and building North Carolina’s green economy.”

Through ARRA funding to the State Energy Program, North Carolina is significantly increasing its investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy, building its sustainable energy economy and workforce and promoting innovation and development of new energy technologies and resources.

The federal Energy Department has given the state the go-ahead to start the program and spend $30.4 million.  The state will receive the remaining funds as it shows it has successfully implemented the plan.

North Carolina is focusing on six areas for federal Recovery Act State Energy Program:

- Supporting small businesses and industry through energy savings, 
- Growing North Carolina’s green workforce through JobsNow, 
- Developing an Energy Investment Revolving Loan Fund, 
- Improving government energy efficiency, 
- Promoting residential energy efficiency and renewable energy, and 
- Fostering renewable energy technology and resource innovation.

“We will increase our energy efficiency, use new and emerging technologies; and develop creative partnerships with the private and nonprofit sectors,” Gov. Perdue said.

Take Your Dog To Work Day

Today, June 26, is "Take Your Dog To Work Day."  The day was created to celebrate the great companions dogs make and to encourage pet adoptions.  Gov. Perdue was happy to participate.


Today she brought North Carolina's First Dogs, Dosie and Zipper, to work.  You can read more about these two Tibetan Terriers on <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstFamily/dosieZipper.aspx>their webpage.

31 Highway Contracts Awarded, Including 11 Recovery Projects

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that 31 contracts totaling $73 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including 11 projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The contracts were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.

“All of these projects will help generate new jobs and economic development for North Carolina, as well as improve travel throughout our state,” Perdue said.

According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.

The 11 recovery projects awarded are located in Bertie, Davidson, Davie, Durham, Franklin, Granville, Guilford, Lee, Stokes, Transylvania and Watauga counties. The 20 other projects awarded are located in Anson, Buncombe, Cabarrus, Catawba, Cumberland, Granville, Henderson, Iredell, Lincoln, Madison, Mecklenburg, Mitchell, New Hanover, Polk, Sampson, Stanly, Transylvania, Warren and Yancey counties. Work on all contracts will start in July.

Cleveland County Manufacturer to Add 114 Jobs

Baldor Electric Co., an international supplier of industrial electric motors, mechanical power transmission products, drives and generators, will expand its Kings Mountain operations.  The company plans to invest more than $12.2 million and create 114 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $157,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

“North Carolina’s manufacturing sector remains strong and diverse,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Our state is attractive to growing companies because of our highly skilled workforce, business-friendly climate and tremendous quality of life.”

Baldor Electric Co., headquartered in Arkansas, operates 26 manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada, England, Mexico and China and provides products to more than 70 countries. Three of the company’s plants are in North Carolina, in Kings Mountain, Marion and Weaverville, employing a combined workforce of nearly 700 people.

Baldor is consolidating operations from South Carolina and moving those manufacturing processes to facilities in other states, including the Kings Mountain plant, which currently employs more than 500 workers.  The 114 new jobs added over the next three years will pay an average wage of $38,329, not including benefits, which is higher than the Cleveland County average of $31,720.

Subject: EUCATION- HIRE QUALITY EDUCATORS

Comment: Please stop the increase of TAXES for use in education by hiring GOOD < QUALITY EDUCATORS!! IN PA , NY,and CT the teachers can handle 27-32 students in Early Childhood Classrooms (K-3rd) while maintaining strong classroom mang. and teaching the task of various genres/ curriculum. In NC, the class size doesn't need to be so small. I was an inner city teacher for 14yrs in both Pittsburgh and Harrisburg PA and I all ways had between 27-32 students in my ECE classrooms and to boot I never had a TA. When NC starts hiring QUALITY EDUCATORS you won't need TA's and the classroom size can be increased. IT is a cop-out to no end to increase TAXES for this reason and most tax payers see right through this, especially the ones from the NORTH !!! It is a sin what you are doing to the working class in NC. Like me , who can't even afford to get our scripts filled and your are all giving cell phones and house phones to people who receive food cards!! What are you all thinking! I will expose these systems if it is the last thing I do before I die! I am terminal and I will expose this to hard working citizens! Your so called TAX INCREASES for what , to kill the working families? Educators need to step up to the plate and teach. The scores in PA, NT and CT are way higher via Iowa Basic, California Aptitude and ACT/SAT's and there classrooms are DOUBLE OURS!!

Hello, Governor Perdue,

I just want to tell you a little about my situation I wrote you about this  before, and I don't know if you got my letter. I work for the cleveland county school system, and on June the 29th I have to take a bus class to get my bus license. The cleveland count board has made it mandatory for all school employee to take this class even teachers, and if they don't take this class they can loose there jobs. I don't think this is fair I worked in the cafeteria,and I love that job. I love the kids at this school. I just love my job, but if I don't pass this test I will lose my job. I have high blood pressure, and I have copple tunnel in both my hands. I don't have a problem with doing the job in the cafeteria, but it will be a problem to drive a school bus, people with high blood presssure don't suppose to drive a school bus because that would be putting the kids lives in danger, but with the board making it mandatory for all school employees to take that class to drive a school bus you have to lie, and the instructor that teaches that class tell people that you have to say you don't have high blood pressure in order to take the class, and not loose your job.. I tried to take the class before, and I didn't pass it you have to make a eighty or higher I only made seventy six. There are so many good workers losing there jobs due to this mandatory. Everyone dosen't want to drive a bus after you have been on your feet all day for six hours. I wish there was something you could do about this I am caught between a rock and a hard place. They said the reason they do this to keep drunks from driving the school bus, but there are drivers who drive that are not employed in the school system that are good drivers so that is not true. Will you see if there is anything you can do about this. Thank You, Mrs. Joan Kee

Dear Mrs. Persek:



Thank you for your letter about the budget crisis and Central Office.  Governor Perdue appreciates hearing from North Carolina’s engaged citizens.  Education always has been a priority for her, and she shares your concerns about the quality of our children’s education and future.



The Governor is considering each choice very carefully as we work together to get North Carolina back on track.  In these difficult times, we are making some very tough decisions to deal with a nearly $5 billion shortfall.  She will keep your ideas in mind as we work to improve the quality of life in North Carolina.



Office of Governor Bev Perdue

Subject: cuts in school central office personnel

Comment: The legislature has proposed all school districts cut Central Office staff by 50%. While large districts may be able to accomplish this, small mountain districts like Transylvania have been running lean for years. There is no room to cut. Why does the legislature contineut to target schools in their budget cuts? Our small district has nothing else to give.

Dear Mr. King:



Thank you for your letter regarding the use NC Education Lottery dollars.  The Governor appreciates hearing from constituents who are concerned about the educational welfare of our state’s youth.



The North Carolina Education Lottery was established to ensure we are providing high quality pre-kindergarten for at-risk four-year-olds, smaller classes in grades K-3, and funding for critical school construction needs in fast-growing and low-wealth counties, as well as college scholarships. For more information on how lottery dollars are spent, please visit their website at: <http://www.nc-educationlottery.org/>http://www.nc-educationlottery.org/  and click on “Where the Money Goes”.



Thank you again for writing and sharing your perspective on this important issue.

Governor,

I could not agree with you more that education is so very important for this state.  My question is why we are having the funding problem when the lottery money was suppose to be going for education.

Also I still am looking for a straight answer for my first question. Is the governor taking days without pay like the state employees.

Thanks

Joe King

Subject: teachers salary

Comment: I cannot believe that with all the m,oney the "Education Lottery" brings in, you would consider lowering our teachers' salaries, which are far below other major cities in the country. This also appllies to police/firemen. Why not lower or eliminate other state employees or reduce excessive spending. ALL of our contemporaries are in agreement!

In my previous email, I asked a simple question:  Gov. Perdue keeps asking legislators for money for education.  However, as I recall, the voters of NC were sold a bill of goods called the Education Lottery that would raise millions for education.  So, I ask again…What has happened to all of the revenue that the education lottery was supposed to generate?  Was money removed from the education budget and moved to the general budget as the lottery started generating revenue?  If so, that is not what NC voters thought was going to happen by voting ‘Yes’ to an “education” lottery…which is an oxymoron in itself.

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our state’s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent — 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolina’s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our state’s budget.

The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolina’s history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolina’s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our state’s mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolina’s long-term economic growth.

Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolina’s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

I’ve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our children’s education.

The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.



          Sincerely,


            Bev Perdue
