Subject: Disability/adult medicade/discrimination

Comment: How can any of the officials stand up and claim that they are only interested in the welfare of their citizens? I've been told for almost 10 years that I am an alcoholic and am Bi-Polar,For almost 30 that I have tourettes syndrom and numerouse other disabilities. true I had an alcohol problem. I tried suicide and almost succeded.Was told to file for disabillity when I was released from Dorthia Dix. I know that I have something called selective amnesia and am suffering from P.T.S.D. and am being treated for anxiety,high blood pressure and high cholesterol. I'm also constantly going through bouts of Prednisone for what was almost 3 years ago a buldging disc,which recently,has got to the point that I remain in constant excruciating back, hip and leg pain with my feet being numb. I can't get adult medicade because I don't have custody of a minor child under the age of 19,but I help care for a new grand child who lives her with his mother,my daughter while she is getting ready to re-enrole in high school. He is not yet two months old. I'm only 50 years old and I do consider this to be age discrimination. How can any of you care when you make and up hold the Social Security disability laws and automatically refuse someone continusely no matter what shape they are in? I don't want to use food stamps. It's embarrassing. I don't like living in constant fear of being evicted because I can't come up with the money for rent.I had to give my heating gas tank back because we couldn't afford to buy the gas to stay warm with. I have exhausted my last means of keeping electricity in my home and this month I don't know what we'll do or how I will be able to keep my daughter,son,63 year old husband and most important of all,my grandson. I'm in a catch 22 with medicade and Dissability. I'm not asking for anything long term or for something for nothing. I'm asking for temporary dissability and medicade long enough to get this second spinal surgery and to continue physical therapy from the cervical spinal surgery in March of 08, so that I can regain full use of my right arm so that I may eventually return to work. I live day and night with sometimes crippeling pain,and have all but begged for help,but all to no avail. If you all care so much about us, the voters,the ones who really have no voice at all,why must you put people through all of these cruel,senseless games of wait & or give up when it comes to dissability & adult medicade? Shouldn't any american who is so far down financially,no matter what age,be able to obtaine medical help especially if it is to get well and return to work? I can't according to D.S.S claim anyone living in my house hold as dependants even though they depend on me,but if I'm working and filing taxes,I can claim anyone depending on me as long as they are not working and I'm taking care of them. When I filed for taxes in 08,even though my husband and I had been seperated for a long time and he had failed to file taxes because he didn't believe that he earned enough to have to file ( he didn't know that the laws had changed) then got penalized,when I did file,that did not stop them from taking the refunds on both my jobs and confiscating my stimulus check. I don't want any thing for free, but I tell you, I'd rather be dead than to live in the mess that this world has turned out to be. The government for the people,by the people,cares more about a pretty park and seems to be FOR most anything but it's people. How do any of you figure that this shows that we are who & what you care for. In every denial and the time that both organizations spend turning a person down and wastes because " that's procedure" the more a condition worsens and the more agony they go through and the weaker we as a people get. How is this putting us first?

Comment: I am writing because I have a problem with power lines outside my house. I have an Electromagnetic Field meter (EMF) and it shows a hazardous amount of EMF coming into my house affecting my family. This amount of EMF has been linked to cancer and other medical problems. I contacted Elizabeth City Electricity and the local health department, neither one cares. Other states have adopted restrictions on the amount of EMF allowed in residentual homes, but not NC. Why? Who can turn to for help?

Subject: First Rate Citizen

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I have submitted a question about a month ago with no response. This is what I wrote: I am a retired military member. I have recently read that there will not be a cost-of-living-adjustment for 2010. I understand that the C.O.L. adjustment is based on inflation and that has been keep at almost 0%. Even though my Electric, Water, Sewage, Garbage and many more essentials have gone up considerably in cost. I also read that President Obama is asking for $250.00 checks to offset the lack of an adjustment. These checks will go to Social Security recipients as well as those receiving veterans or disability benefits, railroad retirees, and retired public employees who don't receive Social Security. I believe these are the same people that received the first round of $250.00 checks earlier this year. I wonder where I fit into this equation. I am retired military, not on Social Security. Would I not fall into the same category as railroad retirees or retired public employees? I haven't received any stimulus money this year. They did although, stopped taking out taxes from my retirement check this past May. Can't wait till tax time to see how much taxes I owe. I have been cashing Savings Bonds to help ends meet. Can you tell me why the military retirees were not included? Are they not as important as civilian retirees? Thanks. As you can see, I am waiting for an answer. Hopefully, you or one of your staff members can take a minute or two out of your busy schedules to answer it. Thank You. Cincerely, Ronald E. Biermann Sr, USAF, Ret.

Subject: Employee of the DOT needs your help!!!!!

Comment: Gov. Perdue my name is Thomas C. Jones. I work out of the Bunn office for Wake Co. DOT maint/contruction. I'm contacting you to ask for your help to sway a decision transfering me from the Bunn camp to the Raliegh maint. yard. This would force me to look for other emploment, because I don't have a vehicle that I would trust a 70+ mile ride on. My childs day cre already charges $1 every minute over 5:30, this normally would run me $10. Now the difference would be a hour. You do the math on my salary (26,400) with the extra gas this would virtually put me on the street. With the economy the way it is and the cost of living going up I can't understand people making this kind of decision not even giving a notice of over 24 hrs. or discussing it with us. I know how to run a backhoe, bulldozer, excavator, roller, dumptruck, etc. Mind you never getting paid to run this equip. but the love of my job keep me there even when told that I would get nothing. I understand that things happened and where blown out of paportion, but I have stood by the DOT's side now I would like to see someone by my side. I was told by Jason Holmes that this decision could not be appealed. Today I was told by human resources that it was after they looked in to it. I am currently out on sick leave with my nerves. This process of sit and wait has literally made me sick. I don't want to be out I would love to be at work but I can not keep playing games my nerves want let me. Any help you can give me getting my position in Bunn back would be greatly appreciated. If I quit it would only cost the state a man who knows his snow route, maint. area. A new manwould have to be trained and get acustomed to the area. For what I can do it will be hard to find another employee for the same $$$. So you could save the state money and trouble. Ask Ben Nelm (TS3 Bunn) about my job performance. Thank you for any help you can be Thomas C. Jones 252-226-4371

Subject: children and custody/visitation issues- Please

Comment: Governor Bev Perdue Office of the Governor We emailed about 2 years back on a custody issue in Stokes Co. NC. We live in Forsyth Co. and can't get it transferred here. Had a restraining order put into effect, Aug. 2008,1 yr. later (Nov. 12th) they send the children back for overnight visitations despite 1 of several therspists testimony and psy. reports and letters from them and the school. Need some answers to where to turn to get Stokes Co. judges and lawyers investigated for not reporting and accepting physical/mental/hospital/child's testimony and abuse reports and continuing unsupervised visitations. Stokes Co. is known for their buddy system. Fought them for 4 years now and the 1 of 3 children were into the reintergration phase, but since yesterday has shown signs of returning to Post Traumatic Stess disorder due to restarting of visitation. The restraining order is supposedly still into effect, but he gets weekend unsupervised visitation?? The father has been in contempt of court orders since all the custody issues started.Why won't a judge help protect children? Who investigates these types of cases? Any information towards the right authorities is appreciated. Thank you in advance. Lucy Peck ps. We are now financially broke. Living week to week and need help just so we can feed and keep a roof over the heads of the chldren.

Subject: Wake County Child Support Enforcment

Comment: My name is Denise Berry and I am a registered Democrat living in Holly Springs NC. I supported both you and the DNC during the election. I am now asking you for some help. I truly don't know where to turn. I have a child support order in effect and have been receiving payment through Wake county Child Support Enforcement, my Case Manager is Miriam Jones. Ms. Jones phone number is 919-856-6667. My MPI 0005273101. The problem has been going on since the beginning of October. At first I had received no payments and after numerous calls and messages left. I received partial payment. I have the copies of the can celled checks from the father's employer showing all payments. NY state has issued the father a statement showing all payments have been received. I have given all this information to Ms. Jones and received a letter from her stating that the money is there but they cannot release it to me until it is due. This made absolutely no sense since it is past-due. After a few more phone calls and messages left for her she sent me a letter stating my ordered support is for $507. per month plus $293 towards arrears. This is incorrect. The amount is for $550 per child and $293 arrears per child per month for 2 children. The order has been in effect for 13 years and has never changed. NY state is still collecting that amount from the employer and the children's father does not dispute this. I have left several messages wanting to know where and how the amount is suddenly different from what it should be since no-one changed it. These messages have not be responded to. I am very frustrated since I do need the money. William Berry is quite upset as well as he sends that money so that it can be used by me for bills etc. and not to be tied up for some on-known reason. Please help me resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you for your assistance and for your public service. Denise M. Berry 209 Brookberry rd. Holly Springs NC 27540 919-762-9622

Subject: Information about the finances and assets from Pace Airlines

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, My name is Wesley McRee, I was a 5 1/2 year employee with Pace Airlines in Winston-Salem until September when a William Rogers, Darryl Richardson and Stuart Carnie took over operations of our company. We had about 337 employees and now the company is no more. We are owed 5 weeks pay, our insurance was cancelled without proper notice aand there is ongoing NCDOL and NCDOI investigations. My problem is when I have talked to the invetigator of DOL and informed him of tooling and other assets of the company that are no longer there he told me that that was up to the NC Attorney Generals office to decide what to do about investigating these assets towards aquiring the moneys to pay us what we are owed. When I contacted the Attorney Generals office about this they tell me that its the NCDOL's responsibility to look into this. I understand that investigations take a while but no one seems to care about what has been allowed to happen to us. Us not getting paid is what brought this whole thing to light. The way I see it nothing should have been allowed to leave the hanger until all assets were acounted for and the investigations complete. Our workforce at Pace was the best I have ever been around. We were hard working, honest and loved our job, and for these people to come into our life and not care anymore about us than they did cannot be allowed to get away with this. I have told the NCDOL that I am here to answer any questions at anytime to help and speed up the investigation. I feel that since we have not filed am lawsuit on these guys that our situation has not been given the priority that it deserves, and that these people that did this will walk. I am asking for any help from your office that can be given. It seems that pressure seems to be what is needed sometimes to bring the real priority into focus. Thank you for your time. Sincerely Wesley McRee

Dear Sirs,



     During the recent Nor'Easter, it became apparent that the drainage ditches infront of my house were plugged up.  I drove aound this morning, and noticed that all the drainage ditches had begun to receed, except those in front of my house, confirming to me that the ditches were indeed plugged up, as I suspected, and reported to the Division of highways four(4) times by phone at (252)453-2721, to no avail.

    This also happened in 2004 and the county and state came out and found a pipe that they didn't know existed. They cleaned the ditch, replaced the pipe and have not been back since. Please note in the first pic where the water backs up. The pipe and ditches have not been cleaned since 2004 so now I have over a foot of water on an acre of land, in my garage and probably many trees, shrubs, etc needing replaced as before. When we called Dept of Highways yesterday the gentleman said they don't have enough people to clean all the ditches and we had not called since 2004. Not acceptable as they have had 5 years to clean our ditch and as of this moment, have still not sent anyone out and continue to ignore our pleas for assistance. I can not get in my garage and cars had to be parked at end of driveway and my animals were trapped. Please advise why our requests are being ignored. Also note I spent $500 back in 2004 to help alleviate the problem before they found the pipe and thousands of dollars replacing all the trees and shrubs I lost.

Also please note first picture 1094. If you look all the way to the left you can see where the water has stopped and this is where the problem is. It looks the same today. In other words, ditch and pipe are clogged.

I called Dept. of Trans in Raleigh, in Elizabeth City, and the office in Maple, NC. No reply to date but it was nice to see the workers today down at the Outer Banks. I guess the rich folks get the attention first.

Subject: Unemployment benefits & mortgage re-organization

Comment: I have a friend who qualifies for the recent unemployment extension...and he is in the process of reorganizing his mortgage so that he does not lose his house. The bank, however, can't approve him because those additional weeks of unemployment are not approved until you get close to the end of the current benefits. How is he supposed to the bank that he will get those benefits when they won't be approved until he gets to the end of the current benefits?

Subject: China

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, After hearing of your recent trip to China I was looking towards you and your office for some advice or assistance. I was born and raised here in North Carolina and attended Appalachian State University. There is where I made my first contact with Chinese culture and language. I went with the school in 2002 to China for a two month long exchange program where we travelled the country after a month of extensive language study. After graduating in 2003 with a International Relations Degree and a double minor in Asian Studies and Appalachianâ€™s first Chinese language minor, I returned to China. I lived there from the spring of 2004 until just recently, working in a variety of areas. Now that I am back in NC, I am looking to use my Chinese skills to find a job. I was wondering if your trip yielded any possible opportunities for someone who is from NC but fluent in Chinese and familiar with customs and practices of life in China. I know now is a rough time for the job market under any condition, but if you never ask then youâ€™ll never know. Thank you for the effort on my behalf. I understand little might come from this, but any avenue is worth exploring. Sincerely, Aaron Lambe boonetraveler@hotmail.com 919.719.0767

Subject: Miltary Spouse Hiring Perference

Comment: Hello I am a military spouse that lived overseas for 3 years and now has relocated back to the states with my husband who is active-duty in the Marine Corps. I really do need to speak with someone concerning a matter that I strongly feel is not being established to help military spouses get a job with the federal government. I was recently called this month and was offered a job with the Department of Defense (Navy) and was giving a start date to show up for work. The job was rescinded because I did not have eligiblity tenure that the job was asking for which I was not aware of until after the job was offered to me. I worked overseas with the Naval Hospital doing the same job with the same grade but had to resign due to a medical condition that required major surgery. There is more to this story and would like to please speak with someone your office to discuss this matter entirely. I don't feel I was treated fairly in this matter and have been frustrated with the local HRO department that offer me the job to help me resolved this matter. I look forward to your reply.

Subject: Phone rates for prisoner's families

Comment: GlobalTel contracts to handle phone calls from state prisons and a lot of county jails. A call from Cumberland County (fayetteville) to Durham costs $11.50 for 15 minutes. GlobalTel requires a prepaid account for you to receive such a call from someone in either a prison or a jail. If you pay by credit card, you pay a 19% fee in addition to the prepaid amount. If you send in a money order, it takes 5-7 days to refill the account (according to their recorded phone message). If an inmate calls from a jail, he is there because he has no money to be bonded out. He is presumed innocent at that point, yet his family pays an outrageous amount to be able to talk to him. Do you in any way think this is a fair way to run a justice system when a presumed innocent person is so restricted in his ability to mount a defense, especially if he is indigent. Even the Bible condemns usury which this practice supported by the state most certainly is. Can this be fixed?

Subject: Dead Beat Dads

Comment: Hi Mrs Perdue, I am writing in reference to my niece thats a college student and her father who is a congressman in NC not supporting her while she is trying to improve her life. I've spoken to him before and his excuse to me is that she doesn't call him and ask for anything. The way I see it is he is a father and she shouldnt have to call him for anything due to the fact that he knows she is a student in college. Is there anything that can be said or done to have him do what he is suppose to do as a father. I personally feel that anyone that votes on laws that put dead beat dads in jail should be more responsible than this. I am coming to you first for help with this situation hoping you can get in front of this before it gets to the DNC. At this point I feel I have no other choice after this except to expose him for being the person that he really is. It was his and my sister's decision to have unprotected sex and bring my niece into this unforgiven world. Feel free to contact me at anytime. We(The Democratic Party) are having a hard enough time right now with bad publicity to have this come up on the news. Your thoughts and suggestions are greatly appreciated. My telephone number: 919-702-6561 Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to read my letter. Miguel D Staten, JW Mount Olive Lodge #36

Dear Governor Perdue,

I recently viewed coverage of the millions of dollars wasted by NC State Politicians on new vehicles purchased by the state and never used. Why did your office only find out about this when a new agency did an undercover investigation? Is there any mechanism within the state (auditors, watchdog agency, management or how about the governors office) in place to prevent this, and that obviously is not working and why?
As most taxpayers are, I am really becoming annoyed and angered with surprise after surprise of state government ineptness and largesse. It is certainly unfair to compare you and your office with former Gov. Easley's shenanigans BUT you are the governor......and you don't know what is going on.....it takes a new crew to find government waste with our dollars....and you are grateful to them for their HELP???
I would be embarrassed. Your comments please.

P.S. Kindly do not have one of your "aides, staff or dept heads" respond to my questions. This is the job of the Governor. You may call me directly if you wish. Thank you.

Sincerely,

Fred Rice

Subject: funding for preservation

Comment: Governor Perdue, I am a 51 year old white female who had to separate from my husband after 31 years of marriage. I also lost my job three times due to a (wrong)diagnosis of cancer. I have had to take off work due to having surgery and taking care of my elderly parents. I have had trouble finding a job and I definitely can not make ends meet. When I was working I had employed two people to help on a farm who also was having trouble finding a job at the time. I invested all the money from savings into trying to preserve a farm in Wake County, taking care of my parents and further education. I really wanted to start my own business but have had no luck in obtaining any funding due to my credit situation. I just wonder what you would do in this situation. I can't afford to place my parents (80's) in an assisted or skilled living facility and it's very hard taking care of them while looking for a job. I get some unemployment but still can not make ends meet. My ideal situation would be a loan where I could start my own business. I have done some research on trying to obtain further education or obtaining a small business loan. Unfortunately I keep running into brick walls. I hope you get this letter and have a chance to respond. I know that you have been able to make your dreams come true. I really have such great ideas to recycle everything a person obtains in their life. I wanted to start an Exchange Club. My ideas are great, I need guidance as to how to implement them. I know you are too busy to meet with a rural American female, but I feel we can make a difference in our community and here in NC. Thanks to whom ever reads this. Thanks even more if I get a response. Susan Pickens Harrod

Comment: I would LOVE for some to explain to me how I get a ticket for speeding and the Fine for is $30 yet the court cost is $130. HOW IN THE WORLD DO YOU JUSTIFY THAT COST. I want to know what the breakdown of that cost is if I mail in a check/money order. I have NEVER EVER seen this before and this is the 3rd state I have lived in and the other 2 do not charge a court cost of any kind when handing out tickets. HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY THE LEGAL FORM OF ROBBERY? The intersting part of all of this is if I actually get a response to my question.

Subject: Children Who are Homeless Wards of State

Comment: I am currently working for DSS, and I have a teenager with schizophrenia that mental health is having trouble finding a placement specifically because of the diagnosis (no one in the state wants children of this kind), and the child is in a very brief temporary living situation with homelessness next. There is no dual diagnosis for the Murdock School, and the Whitaker School is being investigated, but no guarantee. From my understanding with the Mental Health Provider this is becoming a problem in the state of North Carolina with the most vunerable children, and finding placement and help even from the local management entities is not solving the underlying problem. Could the state build a state of the art residential living facility for these children? Can you work on getting legislature to address this? Please respond as soon as possible. I am willing to do whatever. Thank you, Lee Bogle

Governor Perdue,

Good morning! My name is Sarah Bratton, and I am a first grade teacher at Underwood GT Magnet Elementary School here in Raleigh. This year I am doing Mystery Readers in my classroom, where each week someone comes into our classroom to read a picture book to the class. After the story, the children have a chance to ask questions. The total time this takes is about 20 minutes. Readers could be parents, school employees, or members from the community. Before the reader comes, I ask the reader to provide me with a list of five clues, and I read one clue a day for each day to see if the students can guess who the mystery reader is going to be. We would be honored if you would come and read with us.

Thank you for your time,
Sarah B. Bratton, M.A. Ed.
First Grade Teacher
Underwood Gifted and Talented Magnet Elementary School

Subject: letter from Dept. of Revenue

Comment: We received a letter from the Dept. of Rev. demanding $16,000 for 2005 and 2006. 2005 we lived and my wife was working in Pennsylvania. we had built a small cottage at Wolf Laurel (27miles due No of Ashevelle) and put furniture into it starting Sept 29, 2005. This is a half way respite between our children and grandchildren. We travel year around and use this as a resting place and let our family and close relatives use it if they want to visit NC. We are there about 4 to 5 months total. We were called by "Francis" who would not give her last name and she asked for numerous private papers that we feel were not her right to request or look at. A violation of our privacy and the federal Privacy Act. We faxed everything she asked for while talking to her on the phone. Other that getting very abusive and yelling into the phone and demanding "other proof" although she would not say what that might be, the conversation ended with her saying we still owed the money and she would call back the next day which would have been this past Saturday. It is now Monday and she has yet to call. Income tax forms, rental agreements for the apartment in Pa and other similar papers were faxed to "Francis" and none seem to satisfy her. I had this same thing happen either the end of last year or the first of this year and the lady I talked to was very pleasant listened to my explanation and she said nothing further was necessary. She said I was indeed a resident of Fl and owed nothing except local taxes on the property which I had owned for about 20 years. I am still a member ot the Leon County FL Sheriff's Office Mounted Posse, and volunteered my help in Criminal Investigations for 3 years also. I volunteer my services when I am here to the Madison County NC Sheriff's Office. this is my 45th year of volunteering my services to Law Enforcement. I feel this lady was out of line and out of control. I feel that we do not owe anything to NC. We are both retired, my wife since 2005 and me since 1988. I would appreciate the head of the Revenue Department contact me and lets get this satisfied to everyones approval whre we will not have to go through this again; especially with "Francis". Most sincerely, Jerome D. & Constance M. Young

Sondra,



This message does not appear to be education related.  The constituent states he is a student at ASU, but his issue is centered on the Dept. of Social Services.  He’s trying to get food stamps and has been told he does not qualify.



Thanks,

Subject: Citizen concerned on exemptions of the Food and Nutrition Services.

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue: I am composing this message to you in the hopes that it will come across your desk. My name is Ryan Truelove and I am a full-time student at Appalachian State University. I am also a combat veteran and a member of the US Army Reserve stationed at Ft. Bragg, NC. On Friday, November 6th, 2009 I attempted to apply for Food and Nutrition Services at the Watauga county Department of Social Services. After I had painstakingly collected every document needed and extra supporting documentation, I was told I would be denied and I had to sign a piece of paper withdrawing my request. The reason for this is what concerns me. Because I am a full-time student and do not hold a work study position or have a part-time job working more than 20 hours a week, I am not eligible for food stamps. I live on a fixed income of $820.80 a month from the Department of Veteran's Affairs. This money is only sent while I am a full-time student and is prorated (by the day) when a full month of school is not scheduled. My bills greatly exceed my income and bankruptcy is may have to become an option in the near future. I receive full financial aid. When a student receives full financial aid, work study is automatically taken off their award letter because of the aid cap established. I have been looking for a part-time job in Boone, NC for the past 3 months. I cannot find one and this is why I was denied food services. I fear that I may reach a point where I may starve. I believe that I am more than deserving of this state and federal aid. I am a law-abiding citizen and have always paid my taxes. Is there a way for the State of North Carolina to make an exception? Thank you so much for your time and I am awaiting your reply. Sincerely, Ryan Truelove SPC US Army Reserve (910)8508091 ryan.truelove@us.army.mil, rt68897@appstate.edu

Dear Governor Perdue, 
I do <http://www.justice.gov/>hope this letter finds you well and having enjoyed the beautiful weekend.  Unfortunately, I did not have much time to enjoy the sunshine as our all volunteer advocacy campaign had meetings to attend along with brainstorming sessions on ways in which to better advocate on behalf of the most disenfranchised minorities in your state. 
We are hoping you might provide us guidance on the legal obligations federally funded churches have to local, state and federal law with regards to disabled poor people.  Currently, the city of Asheville has made no efforts to have homeless shelters comply with the <http://www.ada.gov/>American Disabilities Act.  If a Federally funded church that is subcontracted by the city, state and nation does not meet the minimum requirements required by law to provide services they say they will, can we tax them in order to retrieve Our tax dollars back so that at risk populations in crisis can obtain the services they need?
This makes perfect sense, given the fact they were given American tax dollars.  We have seen the reality of <http://homelessness.change.org/blog/view/homeless_held_hostage_by_catholic_church_in_dc_fight_for_gay_marriage>Catholicism in caring for the poor in Washington D.C.  This "compassion" also exists within the Federally Funded churches in Asheville, North Carolina.
Thank you again for any assistance you might provide,
Scott R. Young 
The Hopeful

	Why in the world would you not put extra lanes on 485s, where 77 dumps into 485 and it becomes 2 lanes.  Has anyone in the political arena ever tried to drive on that stretch of 2 lane parking lot?  It is a disgrace to NC-DOT and the whole policital arena.  You have 100,000 cars or more a day trying to drive this and it is a virtual parking lot.  Why doesn't anyone address this mess?

Subject: Introducing our firm - an NC HUB Certified Company

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, Thank you for taking the time to read this email. We are Core Solutions, Inc (CSI), a nationally known vendor of electronic health records systems, and a North Carolina Certified HUB Vendor. We enjoy a national customer base including, Monarch in Albemarle, NC. One of the largest agencies in North Carolina. Over the last 10 years our company has specialized in providing systems that automate the collection, storage, reporting and management of health records for agencies of all types and sizes. Our clients include for-profit, non-profit and government entities. For example, the following is a link to a major contract we were just awarded in Pennsylvania that will automate record keeping and reporting for over 60 counties and 700 individual agencies statewide ( http://www.emarketplace.state.pa.us/BidAward.aspx , enter 6100006512 as the bid number). Why do customers continue to buy and implement COREâ€™s system when seemingly less expensive or â€œfreeâ€ solutions are touted almost daily? The answer is simple â€“ thereâ€™s no free lunch. CSI provides a field proven, easy to use system with complete implementation, training and support services provided by CSI â€“ all at costs far below that of any other solution including the so-called â€œfreeâ€ ones. As with most states, Iâ€™m sure North Carolina is looking at electronic health records both to satisfy a wide range of federal mandates and to strive to provide your citizens of more comprehensive and cost effective services. We would appreciate the opportunity to meet members of your lead team and to show how CSIâ€™s successes can help North Carolina meet and exceed its objectives. PS- Congratulations on your stand on the definition of a â€œlife termâ€. We could use that type of common sense at the national level! Regards, Joe Gariano Joseph E. Gariano Core Solutions, Inc.

Subject: Please Help My Family!

Comment: Govenor Perdue, Please help my family and I. Our house is on the market for sale. My husband and I have been on time with our payments since the purchase of the home. Our loan was sold after the banking crisis; it went from Talor, Bean, and Whitiker to Bank of America. Before we were notified of this transfer of the loan, we payed the August 2009 payment to Taylor, Bean, and Whitiker. One week later we received notification that out loan had been switched. We sent the following months payments to Bank of America, but they are continuing to tell us that we are late on this one payment. We've tried sending them are bank statements to show them that we've made August's payment, but to no prevail. The bank is now threatening forclosure! Govenor please, what can we do? How can we fix this? We can't afford an attourney. We can't even afford to make another payment while this is all being straightened around. Please, Govenor Perdue, help us to unvail the truth to this company. We've made the payment! Govenor, my biggest fear is not being able to recover form this unfairness of a forclosure. Is it even legal to do this? I don't know who else to turn to. Please, help us! Please call or email me at your earliest convenience. My telephone number is 315-439-8592. And my email address is listed in the "required information" section. Thank you, Erin Brissenden

Comment: How are you doing, I would like to take this opportunity to possible ask for your help on a on going issue. I was a soldier at Fort Greely. I served my three years honorably as an MP with the 49th MP Security Company . I was however, shot while at fort greely on fort greely. The unit has given me such a hard time with retrieving all the paper work that was produced from the incident. I have some of the paperwork but I can not read it, it is not clear enough to understand or make photo copies of. The sworn statements and all that were done some how went missing. Now that I no longer belong to that unit and have returned to M Day status I can not receive the proper medical treatment.

Subject: Assistance with housing following foreclosure

Comment: I had recently wrote about my battle with my prior employee that discharged me during my mother's terminal illness. In this letter I mentioned I was facing foreclosure. I applied for a modification with my mortgage servicer. Today I learned that my application was denied because I did not provide unemployment varification. Thus on December 12, 2009 the home of my two daughters and I, will go up fpr auction here in Forsyth County. School will be over for me on that same day so I can accept any job available. But due to my unemployment, my credit is poor and I have no funds available for deposits. I don't know as of yet where I will work but i am sure it will be a dentisi office until I myself start Dental school. I am told that Housing Authority no longer accepts Section 8 applications and there is not an emergency plan available. I want to know are there any agencies that can assist us. I hate to pull my girls out of school. My oldest is in the honor acadamy and my youngest just started this year. With all that has happened I hate to traumatize them by moving into a shelter. It saddens me to know that there are so many people in this city who recieve help such as section 8 only because they choose to not work or apply themselves. I have worked all my life and am persuing my doctorates in dentistry. I was terminated from my job for no wrong doing on my part. I am a hard worker and am anxious to get back to work since I have completed all my prerequisites and have been accepted into dental school. But those who chose to live off the system with no ambition take the services of someone truly in need like myself. I just did not decide I did not want to work. I did not decide I just didn't want to pay my mortgage. I feel that certain services should be available for people in my situation who have experienced a tragedy. Again my question is with my now bad credit, no money put away, minimal income to report, are there any services available for housing in Winston Salem, NC? You have shown me how concerned you are for your citizens before. So I thank you in advance for your responce.

Subject: Denial of medical care in NCDOC

Comment: Please let me know if this is something that I should have just "dealt with" or if I should take any legal action and what actions I should take, if any. Thank you. Upon arriving at Craven County Correctional, health care, or should I say lack thereof for others and myself is an issue that needs to be addressed. I arrived at Craven CC on 7/9/09. For some reason my medication chart did not follow. I was and had been treated for anxiety, depression, and panic disorder for approximately six years with klonopin and lexapro. I had been under the care of a psychiatrist in Wilmington, North Carolina and for three years prior to my incarceration, a psychiatrist in Raleigh, North Carolina. I am omitting their names for their privacy. There has always been great concern for the adverse reactions that might occur due to sudden discontinuation of my klonopin and lexapro treatment. I had no idea until I was admitted into the North Carolina Department of Correction what I was in for and what the neglect that the â€œmedical professionalsâ€ of the NCDOC would put me through mentally and physically. On 7/9/09, I am already starting to feel the effects of non-treatment. I inquire about what is going on with my medication and am told that wake county had not faxed my medication chart yet. The nurse at Craven CC told me that they had faxed request to the Wake County jail for my chart and they had not received anything back yet. On 7/10/09, I am starting to shake violently. In desperation, I call my mother and ask her to please get in touch with a nurse at the wake county jail and fax my chart to Craven CC. This is shortly after a self declared medical emergency that got me to who was supposedly the head of the psychology department who proceeded to tell me that â€œI might feel like I am going to die, but wonâ€™t.â€ Why should have to feel like I am going to die? Understand if I was just taken off the street addicted to meth or heroin that I should feel like I am going to die but not because they are refusing to give me my medication. At approximately 4:30PM, my chart is finally faxed to Craven CC because of my motherâ€™s intervention. I am called to the medication window to be told that the do have my chart but someone at Craven had written on my chart â€œHold klonopin until seen by clinician.â€ Thatâ€™s odd, everybody that was on the transfer bus to Craven received his or her klonopin, xanax, flexeril, etc. upon arrival. But the one person that is having full-blown convulsions and possible seizures is being told that they have to wait until Monday, 7/13/09 to receive treatment. On 7/11/09, I am officially scared for my life, so is everybody that is in my cellblock. After about ten inmates telling me that I really need to see a doctor, I declare my second medical emergency. In the NCDOC, a medical emergency has to be â€œlife or limb threatening.â€ I am truly scared for my well being and I could care less about the seven dollars that you are subject to be charged. The procedure is to let the dorm officer know, he or she the contacts the lieutenant or sergeant, then they are the ultimate decision makers on whether or not you are seen by medical. The dorm officer had informed the sergeant of the situation and after two hours, she has her hands up n the air wondering why nobody had responded. I then reiterate my concern, six hours passâ€¦no response. On 7/12/09, I am in horrible shape. I had not slept or eaten in three days. I had not slept because my eyeballs would not stop twitching from left to right, my body will not stop shaking, and I hardly feel human anymore. I had not eaten because I was in such a wreck that I could barely walk to the dining hall, and if I had made it, I was shaking to badly to put a fork to my mouth. I declare another medical emergency with hopes to have food brought to me in medical. I finally saw a nurse who angrily told me â€œIt is illegal for me to give you klonopin in here!â€ and that â€œthere are no alternatives for my medical condition.â€ Once she saw that I was in truly a horrible shape, she became somewhat nice, got me some food, and called the doctor at home to see if he would release my medicationâ€¦.no response. I filed grievance #3085-09-0429 regarding the need for medical care. On 7/13/09, I am paged to the medication window and the nurse who told me that it was illegal to give me my medication was now performing the â€œillegalâ€ act of giving me klonopin. She is very apologetic and it doing it with a big smile on her face. So much for the â€œhold klonopin until seen by clinician.â€ I never had to be seen by anybody. Between the dates of 7/13/09 and 7/24/09, I was administered a tapered dose of klonopin ending on 7/24/09. A lot of inmates that were prescribed a benzodiazapine, muscle relaxer, or pankiller for medicinal treatment were very concerned about their health when they started to catch word that the doctors and psychiatrists at Craven take them off of their medication regardless of the possible adverse reactions. They will do you the justice of a very short taper, though. There are considerations that need to be made when deciding how long and at what increments the taper should be. As for myself, when I was incarcerated in the Wake County jail, I had brought my medication with me and I was prescribed 2mg of klonopin to be taken 3 times a day. That is a lot. But that is what I needed. The psychiatrist at the Wake County jail saw this and started my taper from 2mg 2 times a day to 1.75mg 2 times a day. Hold that for a week, and then go to 1.5mg 2 times a day for a week and so on. I donâ€™t quite feel like doing the math, but that is a taper over a couple of months due to my dosage. Sometime around 7/19/09, I spoke with the psychiatrist, Dr. Hamra. He told me that I was lucky to have been given 10 days and if it were he, he would have taken me off of it that very same day. He explained to me that klonopin was â€œnot allowedâ€ in the prison system and that there were no alternatives to treat my medical condition that I had been suffering from since 2002. I even begged him for Vistaril, Restoril, or even Buspar, non-narcotic options, he would not do it. As a licensed psychiatrist, when a patient is sitting before you having convulsions and can hardly put sentences together, wouldnâ€™t you think they would do something for you. Dr. Hamraâ€™s malpractice led him to make me a mental health level 3 and nursing level 2B. For the record, I was completely and totally fine upon arriving at Craven. I had spent 4 months in Wake County jail and was completely fine. I even called my mother the first day that I got there and told her that the next few months were gong to be a breeze. Approximately 10 days later, after being denied medical care, I am a mental health level 3, which is severe, 4 is the worst, and am a nursing level 2B which I believe means that I will be in need of intensive medical supervision. This man knew exactly what he was doing to me and my treatment was essentially non-treatment. I ended up not taking the lexapro around 10/23/09 because I am beyond depressed now. My body and mind have almost gone into complete shock and I am shaking so bad that I am spilling the water given to me to take my medication including my second to last dose of klonopin, 5mg. Please note that he had extensive notes from my psychiatrist of 3 years in Raleigh in front of him that he told me did not matter and simply complained about his handwriting. He did not take my psychiatrist notes into consideration. I spoke with this Dr. Hamra again on 7/29/09. I explained to him the convulsions, not sleeping for 4 days, not being able to form sentences or read anymore. Hs response was â€œI know, itâ€™s horrible isnâ€™t it?â€ I asked him why he is allowing me to be put into the weakest mental and physical state had ever been in since birth, especially in prison, and why he is not treating me in any way and his response is that klonopin is â€œnot allowed in the prison systemâ€ once againâ€¦..no alternatives. The next day 7/30/09, I am transferred to one of the worst places there s in North Carolina, Duplin County Correctional. Everybody there was either in a wheelchair, had ADS, terminally ill, very old, retardedâ€¦it was essentially a hospital. Everybody that people wondered what was wrong with at Craven was here. I am 7 hours away from Buncombe County Correctional, where I was supposed to go after processing at Craven. But due to the denial of medical care at Craven CC, have been put here. I walked into Craven as one of the most healthy inmates in that place to being sent to a medical camp where the most unhealthy minimum custody inmates have to go. There is something very wrong with this picture. I am still having horrible convulsions and as soon as I lay down on my bunk, the muscles around my skull start twitching hard and fast. I havenâ€™t a clue what is gong on. I did not even know this was possible. I stumble to the sergeantâ€™s office and try to explain to him what is happening and that need medical attention. I explain to him that I am in complete shock, show him my now violently twitching skull and he proceeds to tap his temples and say â€œbeep-boopâ€ over again. I was denied to go see a nurse and was told to go lay back down. On 8/3/09, my bunkmate inquires why I am shaking so badly. I explain to him and others in my block what had been through and they all suggest to declare a medical emergency and get checked out. I approach the dorm officer and tell him that I am afraid for my life, he calls medical, medical asks him if I am breathing OK, he tells them â€œyes,â€ and the nurse tells him to tell me to go lay back down and deal with it. On 8/4/09, symptoms are still horrible. I walked to medical and presented myself to 2 nurses. The one that was on the phone the previous night whispers to me, because she said that she would be embarrassed to tell me out loud, that this is part of my medical condition and to go lay back down. I said, â€œSo this is normal? People live like this everyday?â€ She responded with â€œyes they do if they have anxiety or panic disorder.â€ I told her that I was perfectly normal a month ago and due to the malpractice of the medical professionals of the NCDOC I am standing before her like this. She told me to go lay back down. Then went and fled grievance #4125-09-0220 that mentioned the 7 medical emergencies that I received no medical assistance for. I wrote down that simply talking to a physician would solve my grievance. Earlier that day, had spoken with my case manager, Ms. Peele, and while speaking to her, she wrote down â€œpossible level 4.â€ Level 4 is medical gain time. You have to be completely disabled to be considered for this. Yet, I was considered. I went from managing an Outback Steakhouse and opening other restaurant concepts to being so disabled that could not achieve any gain time on my own? I started to think that there was some kind of conspiracy to deny me medical care and keep me in prison as long as possible. I was then transferred to Wake County correctional on 8/6/09 to go to court. During orientation, officer Powell performed medical screenings for all of the transfers and I was asked if I was suffering from any mental health issues. He proceeded to recite â€œI see dead peopleâ€ from a popular box office film before I could answer. I am not going to discuss what is happening to me in front of twelve other inmates if I am not to be taken seriously. This should be held in the privacy of a licensed medical professional. I put in a sick call on 8/7/09 to discuss with a nurse the urgency of seeing a doctor or psychiatrist. She referred me to mental health. Fled grievance #4265-09-125 discussing that I was from Raleigh and that I should not have to be transferred back to Duplin and questioning why I was not at Buncombe County Correctional. I actually started to feel somewhat normal in Wake County because I was not surrounded by old and sick people. I was transferred back to Duplin CC on 8/13/09. Between the dates of 8/13/09 and 9/1/09, I tried multiple times to be seen by mental health or a doctor. By now, 6 nurses had referred me to mental health, eleven mental health requests had been issued, and 2 unresolved grievances regarding the urgency of medical care or having me changed to a mental health level 1 so I could go to Wake or Buncombe CC. It turns out that the psychiatrist can make someone a level 2 and the psychologist can make you a level 1. I saw the staff psychologist, Ms. Baucom. I was not paged to come see her due to my requests and referrals. I was paged to see her to resolve the grievance filed in Wake county about being stuck in medical camps and either wanting to stay in Wake County or transferred to Buncombe County. I had to get out of this hospital environment or be treated. That is all I was asking for. She sad she would set me up an appointment with the psychiatrist for the following week. On 9/2/09, I wrote a letter to the superintendent of Duplin CC, Mr. Cavanaugh regarding the fact that my minimum was 5 days from then, 9/7/09, for some reason my release date was scheduled for 10/21/09, why had not received medical care, and if there was anything I could do to get any merit days to get out earlier so I could seek medical help. On 9/3/09, the litter squad is called in early because Mr. Cavanaugh would like to speak to me regarding my letter. Hs response was â€œI donâ€™t give merit days. I have nothing for you to do to get out anywhere close to my minimum and talk to medical about your medical issues. I have nothing to do with medical.â€ This is at a medical camp! It turns out that the psychiatrist is seeing the inmates at Duplin this day. When I found out, I went to programs where the sessions were being held and asked Ms. Baucom why I never saw him. She tells me that â€œwas not on the list.â€ I truly thought I was going to pass out. This was absurd. On 9/4/09, Mr. Cavanaugh calls me into his office to resolve grievance #4125-09-0220. My resolution was to be seen by a physician or psychiatrist, this had not occurred yet. It was appealed to the secretary, DOC on 9/4/09. I am out and this grievance was never resolved. So the secretary of DOC is fully aware of this. On 9/8/09, I was transferred to Foothills CI. I had made it here solely because I wrote that grievance regarding being 7 hours away from home. This was the only other minimum custody prison I could go to that would allow a mental health level 3 that was close to my family. If I had not put in a transfer and insisted on being close to home, I would had been at Duplin until a couple of days prior to my release and my mother would have driven 14 hours total just to come see her child. Of course, I am in another hospital prison. I witnessed 3 people almost die after being there for a week. The ambulance would show up at least once a week and the nurses nor the officers had a clue of what to do. You would think there would be some kind of medical training at these camps. When I saw the nurse for my medical screening upon arrival, she told me that she had already put in a referral to mental health upon looking at my medical jacket. There must be something in my medical jacket that raises a flag that I should see the psychiatrist. Eventually, I saw the psychiatrist, Ms. Rutherford, whose first question was â€œwhat do you want to accomplish by talking to me?â€ I told her that I need to be treated for my anxiety and panic disorder, showed her how bad my hands were shaking and that if I am going to be denied medical treatment to release me so I can be treated. She told me â€œI was the product of a bad doctor.â€ Other anti-anxiety medications such as Restoril will not help. I finally told her to bring me down to a mental health level 1 so that I could get the hell out of this hospital. She ended up making me a level 2 and told me that the psychologist can make me a level 1 so I can finally, 2 months later, be transferred to Buncombe CC where I was suppose to go in the first place. The following week I saw the psychologist, Dr. Vaughn I believe was his name. He said that he was not releasing me from mental health and was going to keep me at a level 2 so I could not put in a transfer to Buncombe County Correctional, they only allow mental health level 1. He also told me that I would need to stay at Foothills to speak to a social worker about receiving free mental health services and vocational rehabilitation upon my release. That never happened. I was released on 10/24/09. In conclusion, many other things happened to me due to non-treatment. There were 3 occasions where my body had seized up up to 5 hours. This was by far the scariest thing I have ever been through and between 7/8/09 and 10/24/09, spending at least $50, $5 per sick call, 7 declared emergences, 6 nurse referrals to mental heath, 11 requests for mental health, and 2 grievances regarding the urgency for health care, I was never treated. Please note, a lot of people suffer from anxiety, depression, and panic disorder and do not need hospitalization. Hospitalization may occur if these symptoms are not treated. Dr. Hamra knew this. He knew exactly what his malpractice would cause. Why else would somebody make a perfectly healthy human being a nursing level 2b and ship them off to a medical camp. There is something very wrong here that requires immediate attention. In the Inmate/Outpatient Orientation Booklet for Health Services of the North Carolina Department of Correction Davision of Prisons form DC-968 it states: Mission Statement It is the mission of the North Carolina Department of Correction, Division of Parsons, Health Services section to: Ensure that all incarcerated individuals receive comprehensive healthcare equivalent to that available in the community and subject to the same regulations. Provide continuous monitoring and evaluation of the accessibility, availability and quality of health care provided by this division. Provide opportunities for professional development of staff through continuing education and effective health education for inmates. This Mission Has Failed Miserably One firm referred me to North Carolina Prisoner Legal Services. The NCPLS are paid by the Department of Correction to help DOC in cases that could hurt DOC. There is absolutely no logic in DOC hiring and paying NC Prisoner Legal Services to "help" inmates, when this is not true. They say they serve 32,000 inmates, not really. They really don't represent any of them because they represent DOC. There are two sides and NCPLS sides with those who pay them. By submitting a case to them you are simply giving them more to cover up in the NCDOC. I can't believe inmates do not see this. The NCPLS is the toilet paper that keeps the asses of the staff of the NCDOC clean. I am sure NCPLS will eventually catch wind of this and attempt to burn my DOC medical jacket. I did submit this very same document a week ago to NCPLS and got no response. Please let me know if you can help or steer me in the right direction.

Subject: Niece in foster care in your state, have not even been allowed to meet her

Comment: I was contacted in September by family finders unit in Buncombe County Dept of Social Services and told I have a 10 yr.old niece that I never knew about that has been a ward of the state since she was 5. She has a lot of family that are concerned for her. Numerous requests to meet her have been ignored by her social worker, whose name has even been withheld from me. I have requested numerous times to have my niece for the holidays and get her out of the group home she is in. Ten yrs old is too young to be in a group home, but I respect that she has been cared for in the absence of family. What do I have to do to meet my niece and have her for Christmas or at least give her that option? To date I have written her, sent her gifts, etc, and it is my understanding that she still knows nothing of her family in Arizona and New Mexico. Doesn't she have a right to know that she has caring family out here who have never met her but worry about her and want her in their lives? Wouldn't she be better off with family than in a group home for the holidays? I worry about her becoming too institutionalized to adapt to family life outside an institution. My contact in N.C. has been social worker, Lois Norman @ 828-250-5881. They say the wheels move slowly, but 5 years in the custody of the state of Carolina is just too slow for words. Please help... Respectfully, Cindy Halley

Comment: Where do I need to contact, with a city employee of concord unlawfully breaking into my home and the chief of police refuse to address my problem. If you would request all the letters that I have sent to the city of concord trying to solve this problem. You would get an idea to what I'am going thru. Have filed a complant with the us postial inspectors office with the city using certified letters from the post office and not paying the postal fee's and not having the post office properly delver the certified letters. All city officals refuse to even address these issues. mike helms 704-773-0995

Subject: Health and Environmental Assistance

Comment: The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am in desperate need of your help. I own property with heirs in Craven County, Havelock (Harlowe). Craven Countyâ€™s North Carolina Department of Environment & Natural Resources/Division of Environmental Health Office sent me a Notice of Violation - On-Site Wastewater System dated July 2, 2009, for 1630 Temples Point Road and a Notice of Violation - On-Site Wastewater System dated November 5, 2009, for 1685 Temples Point Road. The Environmental Health Office refuses to suspend or revoke the permits pending identification of other land owners to have the appropriate authorization to seek a repair permit to protect the health and safety of the public and environment. The Craven County Planning Office used grants to replace old dilapidated homes with mobile homes and sewer systems during 2004. Both installed sewer systems have completely failed. The current occupants have not attempted to resolve the waste problem on the land. I have attempted to remove the occupants pending resolution of the problem; to no avail. I sought legal representation with Mr. John Harmon only to discover no landlord/tenant agreement exist, so the Civil Court dismissed my case and referred us to Civil Court to file trespassing charges. We filed trespassing charges with the Criminal Court; the trespassing charges were dismissed and we were referred back to Civil Court. Fearful of legal actions against me, I hired a sewer contractor to pump the septic tank system at 1630 Temples Point Rd on 26 and 27 Oct. He had to also clean sludge from the distribution box and attempted to open three of the six drain lines. Upon inspection from the Environmental Health Office, the septic tank was over half full to indicate the system has failed. During the inspection, the inspector was informed of another failed sewer system on the property, and I was then issued another notice for 1685 Temples Point Road. The Environmental Health Office is holding me solely responsible for replacing two sewer systems that have failed. I have sought legal assistance from Mr. Frank Sheffield Jr., Ward and Smith, to be informed the Environmental Health Office will not suspend or revoke the permits pending resolution of repairs. Mr. Sheffield and I have personally requested suspension or revocation of the permits pending identified of other property owners to seek a repair permit to protect the health and safety of the public and environment. The Environmental Health Office refuses to revoke or suspend the permits because they are concerned where the occupants will live. Therefore, the Environmental Health Office informed me charges will be filed against me for non-compliance. I am more concerned about the health and safety of the public and environment and possible lawsuits if anyone gets sick from the waste on the ground. I have also contacted the Craven County Commissioner, Mr. Theron McCabe, only to be informed I must repair the sewer systems as the land owner and the occupants do not have to leave. I only ask assistance to revoke or suspend the permits pending identification of other land owners to have the appropriate authorization to seek a repair permit. My actions are only to avoid jeopardizing the public health and safety and any detrimental effect on the environment through contamination of the land, ground and surface waters. I greatly appreciate any assistance provided to me. I am at a loss what to do next. You may contact at (252) 349-1195 if you need additional information. Thank you so very much for your time and assistance. Very respectfully, MAGGIE M. SMITH

Subject: State Health Plan Fraud

Comment: Hello, I reported an issue to the State Health Plan that has resulted in a $2.5 million recovery. I am the former Director of Managed Care for NC Baptist Hospital. I reported to the State Health Plan that NCBH was concealing its rate increases from the SHP which was resulting in overpayments. I filed a fraud allegation with the NC Attorney General's office and was surprised to find that the attorney assigned to my filing was also the attorney who works for the State Health Plan. This attorney, Ms. Lotta Crabtree, never interviewed me or asked me any questions about my allegations. She did inform me today that she had determined that the issue with NCBH was a 'contract dispute' and that if I had an allegation of criminal activity I should contact my local police or the district attorney. As this issue involves alleged fraud prepetrated against the State Health Plan it should be handled by the NC Attorney General. Further, the legal review of this allegation should be conducted by someone not affiliated with the State Health Plan. I may be reached at 336.766.0084. Thank you, Joe Vincoli 336.766.0084
