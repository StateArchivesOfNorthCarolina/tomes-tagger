> Gov. Perdue Blocks Proposal to Hike Income Tax on Working Families

On Thursday, Gov. Perdue announced her opposition to a proposed budget deal between the House and Senate.†

> "I will not support a budget that is balanced on the backs of working families and that does not protect our public schools,"†said Gov. Perdue.

> The legislative budget proposal included an income tax surcharge on all taxpayers and did not do what is necessary to protect public education.† Gov. Perdue called on the House and Senate to work together quickly to pass a†budget that protects public education and core services without being balanced on the backs of working families.

> Governor Signs Executive Order to Restrict Spending, Ensure Balanced Budget

Gov. Bev Perdue today signed <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=536>Executive Order 20, restricting state spending to ensure a balanced budget while legislators work to finalize a budget for the 2009-10 fiscal year.

> ìUntil a budget is signed, this order will ensure that North Carolina maintains a balanced budget and that state agencies continue to follow the strict spending guidelines in place during the previous fiscal year,î Gov. Perdue said.

> The executive order directs the Office of State Budget and Management (OSBM) to prioritize spending on mandatory obligations and to restrict state agency spending on travel and purchase orders for goods and services. It also restricts agency spending to fill vacant positions.

> To protect the stateís core responsibilities in education and public safety, the order allows OSBM to make exceptions for direct expenses for classroom instruction and emergency situations related to law enforcement, health care and public safety.

> The order rescinds the governorís previous executive order to restrict spending for the 2008-09 fiscal year.

> Continental Teves to Add 338 Jobs in Fletcher

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Monday†announced brake systems and components manufacturer Continental Teves will expand its operations in Henderson County.† The company, a wholly owned subsidiary of global automotive supplier Continental, plans to invest $30.1 million and create 338 jobs in Fletcher during the next five years.

> ìNorth Carolina ranks 10th nationally in automotive-related jobs thanks to the commitment of such international leaders as Continental and its subsidiary in our state,î Gov. Perdue said. ìEstablished companies continue to grow here because they know the value of our top business climate and skilled workforce.î

> Continental has its North American headquarters in Michigan and operates two facilities in North Carolina. The Fletcher manufacturing plant currently employs 288 workers, while a plant in Morganton has 367 employees. The overall average wage for the 338 new jobs in Fletcher is expected to be $36,179, not counting benefits, which is higher than the Henderson County average of $31,252.

> North Carolina continues to have a top-ranked business climate.† Through Gov. Perdueís JobsNOW initiative, the state will work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain our workforce and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

> For more information about Continental Teves or Continental, visit <http://www.conti-online.com>www.conti-online.com.††For information about employment opportunities at the Fletcher manufacturing plant, call the Henderson County office of the N.C. Employment Security Commission at (828) 693-1703.

> Gov. Perdue Announces Second Round of Drinking Water and Wastewater Recovery Projects

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Monday announced a total of $45.2 million in drinking water, stormwater and wastewater projects in a second round of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) awards.† In total, 40 communities in 31 counties received second-round funding.† More than half of the second-round projects were identified as ìgreenî projects.

> ìThese JobsNOW Recovery projects will create jobs, boost the economy, improve the stateís infrastructure and protect North Carolinaís drinking water and other water systems in the future,î said Perdue.

> Nearly $23.9 million in recovery funds will be distributed by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to 28 communities for public water supply projects.† New Hanover County, Jacksonville and Cary were each†awarded $3 million, the maximum amount allowed by the ARRA program.† The full list of second-round drinking water award recipients is now available at: <http://www.deh.enr.state.nc.us/pws/recovery.htm>www.deh.enr.state.nc.us/pws/recovery.htm.† In April, $40.3 million in drinking water funds were awarded to 35 local systems in the initial round of projects.

> In addition, awards totaling $21.3 million will go to 12 communities for wastewater and stormwater projects.† Southport, Burgaw, Brunswick County and Buncombe County received the $3 million maximum allowed under ARRA.† The full list of second-round stormwater and wastewater award recipients is available at: <http://www.nccgl.net/Stimulus.html>www.nccgl.net/Stimulus.html.† In April, $45.8 million were awarded to 36 communities for stormwater and wastewater projects.

Subject: 30th Heavy Brigade

Comment: Governor Purdue and Staff, I just wanted to forward an email I received from a friend in the North Carolina National Guard's 30th Heavy Brigade. She is a 1LT with Nearly 10 years of service and on her second deployment to Iraq. Thanks for your time, Jason Cain SEE BELOW... "yeah it is pretty sad that Americans dying at war isn't as important as michael jackson od'ing or however he died. i've been talking and emailing erin fairly regularly so they sound like they are having a lot of fun--i'm jealous:) erin said sadie is a little uneasy whenever they go anywhere asking where she is going to sleep that night and stuff so maybe when she gets back you can try and stay settled a bit. or have your mom come visit instead of having sadie going to atl or your brother's y'know what i mean? just so she can have a little big of stability in all this. we are still doing convoys so we aren't completely shut in, but someone really needs to explain to me what i'm doing here before i lose it. we aren't training the iraqis, and (praise God) we aren't treating any trauma patients. it's like we are just surviving and i just don't get it. if they wanted us to set up a level II and give some nc troops some free health care for a year we could have done this in goldsboro. where no one would have been blown up and we could still see our families. i just don't get what we are doing here--no one seems to and i'm just about done with this crappy organization they call the united states army that is just out to take care of their favorites and make money on people less fortunate. they spent 3 million dollars to fix up this fob and our floors look like an earthquake went through b/c the ground wasn't settled before they started building. my ceiling is an inch think piece of paneling that doesn't even begin to keep out the dust that is giving us all sore throats and respitory problems. this place is disgusting and i don't just mean visually. the gross negligence the military, government, whomever has committed against Soldiers, Americans, and now the Iraqi people is disgusting. i'm not a smart person i don't understand all the political stuff like you do, but i need someone to explain to me why i left my daughter for a year. they don't want our help and we aren't doing anything to help them except ruining the roads with monstrous vehicles that pollute the air with all the fumes they expel. like a i said it's disgusting. and then on top of all that--we have stupid garrison rules like pt belts, not taking acu tops off when working outside, booney cap is the only one authorized to wear even though they only issued us one and laundry is a 72hr turn around. its just stupid little gay stuff like that that just makes everyday life just annoying. bad enough were in this crap country we can't relax without feeling guilty. so i don't care if you say anything--maybe leave my name out of it so i don't get in trouble but i think people should know how the government is wasting their money. that people are still dying over here--this isn't over. and just a reason we left our families."

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession,†which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our stateís unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent ó 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolinaís families have been hurt by the recession, so has our stateís budget.

The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolinaís history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolinaís government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our stateís mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolinaís long-term economic growth.

Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect†core education, public safety and health care services,†or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

Public education always†has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolinaís economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

Iíve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect†public education.† Now I need your help.† The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.† But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our childrenís education.

The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.



††††††††††Sincerely,


††††††††††† Bev Perdue

Subject: community organizations and stimulus funds

Comment: The East Hamlet Concerned Citizens, a community organization in Richmond County,NC would like to know if by any chance we might be recipents of any of the stimulus money from the federal government. Our community looks like a third world country, rain forest and all. With the sheriff calling a local African-American business man an "idiot", I don't think we're going to be bonding real good with our local government, in other words funds just might not flow our way. Our community has never received block grant money or anything along those lines. We're dead here, all that's needed is the dirt to cover us up. I voted for you, Governor, because I felt that if women could raise sons to be governor, they(women) could probably do the job with their eyes closed. And I believe if given a chance and some help, our community can make a come back. Thanks for listening.

Comment: The Davenport Family 637 Mail Route Road Creswell, NC 27928 252-333-7887 July 17th, 2009 Dear State Elected Officialt: Hi. We are the the Davenport Family. My name is Becki and my son is Joey Davenport, who is now age 17. Joey has Brain and Spine Cancer and is a patient currently receiving chemotherapy, medication, labs, testing, surgeries, etc... at Duke University Hospital in Durham, NC. At this time, we are required to take Joey to Duke Hospital at least every other week and most often times, every week, depending on how Joey is doing, which tests he is due for (labs, MRI's, CT Scans, EEG's, etc...), and which doctors he needs to see. Joey has been battling this deadly disease most all of his life and it is the only life he knows. Joey's diagnosis is : Desmoplasticneuroepithelialgangliocytoma. His Physician is a Pediatric Neuro Oncologist, named Dr. Sridharan Gururangan and can be reached at the Duke Hospital, should you have any questions about Joey's illness. Our family's Social Worker is Virginia Calhoun and can also be reached at the Duke Hospital, her contact info is: Ginny Calhoun, MSW, LCSW, Pediatric Neuro- Oncology Social Work, Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke, 919-668-2327. Ginny can verify Joey's diagnosis and our families financial need at this time, as we have given her all of our financial information in an attempt to try to find some help. I am out of work and have been unsuccessful at finding work due to the economy. My husband is self employed and his work has diminished greatly. Our family is suffering financially at this time, and have been encouraged by our social worker to reach out to our community for help. We have been living off of credit cards for the past 6 months up until the credit card companies found out our son had cancer, and have since lowered our credit limit to our balances, leaving us with no available credit. We are struggling to even afford gas to get Joey back and forth to the hospital, located in Durham, NC. We are writing to you today to ask if you have any available funds that you could use to help our family. If you have any questions or would like verification of our families situation, or if you prefer to get our information on our accounts that we need help with, you have our permission to speak directly with our Social worker at Duke Hospital. Virginia Calhoun has been given permission by our family to give out our information on our bills, so that you can pay our lenders, etc. directly if that is what you prefer. If you cannot offer our family any help at this time, we absolutely understand. But please do not hesitate to pass our families contact information on to anyone else you feel may be able to help us. We are on Welfare, Medicaid, Food Stamps and our son is disabled and is on SSI. Our total income is $674 a month. Our home is worth $41,000 and we owe Chase home equity $41,000.00, we own a car that is a 2003 and we owe Huntington Bank $15,000 and the car is worth $8,000.00 We live a very modest life, in a very modest home. And just cannot get ahead while paying these three credit cards. Especially when we cannot even use them for gas anymore, in order to get our son to the hospital for chemotherapy. We also have three credit cards that total approximately $26000.00 and their contact information is shown below, stating the balances, contact info, etc...... We have attempted to contact all three credit card companies and none of them will work with us. We have contacted at least 15 non profit organizations that are out there raising money for CANCER and they are leading everyone in society to believe that they are helping families, but so far after months of asking, I have received a total of $25.00 and that was from the Children's Cancer Fund of America, Inc.

Subject: Disability

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, My name is Sonja Chavez Alarcon.I have been turned down twice for disability. I have an attorney, James Scott Farrin, but even with an attorney I was turned down and have been told it will now be 18-24 months before I can go before a judge. I am in pain everyday,suffer from depression,and I am unable to work-I have been advised my condition will only get worse over time. Why does someone have to wait so long to get a determination? SS Dept. says I can do "light work". I found out that is a generic letter they send to everyone. I asked them what type of work they consider that to be and where would I get it? Especially in these times? They did not know,I was told they were not "vocational therapists." Then how did they determine I can work? My husband can not pay my bills and his-he is also stressed and depressed,as we could possibly lose our home-I contacted my attorney for advice, and all they say is I have to wait.Please, if you are the wrong department to bring this issue to,I apologise,but I need help-please advise me. Sincerely, Sonja Chavez Alarcon

> Gov. Perdue Signs Bill to Increase Transparency in State Mental Health Facilities

Gov. Bev Perdue today signed Senate Bill 799 to increase the transparency of state mental health, developmental disability and substance abuse facilities by making more information in death records public. Perdue proposed this legislation in March with Attorney General Roy Cooper. It was sponsored by Sen. Rand (D-Bladen, Cumberland).†

> ìThis legislation puts the safety of our patients first by ensuring that important information in death records is available to the public,î said Perdue. ìBy increasing transparency, we will make state facilities more accountable to the people in their care, restore public confidence and rebuild public trust.î

> Senate Bill 799 will require the following information regarding deaths in state facilities to be public information:

> - The name, sex, age and date of birth of the deceased;†
> - The name of the facility providing the report;†
> - The date, time and location of the death;†
> - A brief description of the circumstances of death, including the manner of death if known; and†
> - A list of all entities to whom the event was reported.

> ìMore disclosure can shine a light on problems and help ensure patientsí safety.† Our investigators and prosecutors will continue to enforce the law against those who abuse patients in state facilities,î said Cooper.

> ìTransforming the stateís facilities into a true system of care is foremost, and part of that transformation means operating in a climate of transparency.î said DHHS Secretary Lanier Cansler. ìWhile we want to make sure we protect the rights of the individuals we serve, we also want to make sure the public has access to information about our facilities and our plans to correct areas of deficiencies.î

> North Carolina to Receive $8.8 Million to Help Citizens Buy Energy-Efficient Appliances

Gov. Bev Perdue this week†announced that North Carolina is in line to receive $8.8 million in federal funds to help homeowners purchase energy-efficient appliances, from furnaces and room air conditioners to refrigerators and dishwashers.† The money for ENERGY STAR rated appliances would be distributed through a program to be developed by the Energy Office along with the N.C. Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.

> The funds are part of nearly $300 million from the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act being distributed nationwide by the U.S. Department of Energy.

> ìAffordable, energy efficient appliances are not only good for the environment, they cut energy costs for consumers and create more business for retailers,î said Perdue. ìThese recovery funds will help boost our green economy, and make North Carolina a more environmentally friendly state.î

> The federal Energy Department is recommending that states focus the rebate program efforts on heating and cooling equipment, appliances and water heaters, since these products offer the greatest energy saving potential.

> In addition, the state and federal government offer tax advantages on the purchase of some major home appliances.† North Carolina also offers a sales tax free holiday weekend on the purchase of some ENERGY STAR products.† This year it is scheduled for Friday, Nov. 6, through Sunday, Nov. 8.

> For more information on the federal ENERGY STAR rebate program, visit <http://www.energy.gov/recovery>www.energy.gov/recovery.†

> Gov. Perdue Calls for Closer Safety Oversight of Coal Ash Ponds

Gov. Perdue this week†urged state lawmakers to pass legislation that would increase the safety oversight of coal ash ponds in North Carolina.† The legislation would subject the dams that create coal ash ponds to direct inspection by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources.

> ìBecause of where some of the ponds are located, greater safety oversight and more frequent inspections will help reduce potential risks,î said Perdue.

> A ìhigh hazardî designation was created in the 1980ís for coal ash impoundments and other similar dams that are near densely populated areas or downstream water supplies because of the potential impact of a damís failure.† The designation does not reflect the structural condition of the dam.

> Currently, power companies are only required to file reports every five years by private engineers on the structural conditions of the dams.† The impoundments are exempt from regulation under the N.C. Dam Safety Act.

> The proposal will be sponsored by Rep. Pricey Harrison of Greensboro and will subject coal ash dams to the Dam Safety Act, which would more closely regulate the impoundments and would require a state inspection every two years.

Where are the funds for the Medicaid†(Cap) program, Health and Uman Services, Developmental Disabilities, Teachers, and I also mentioned about the Medicare and Social Security that should have been budgeted for before all the millions of dollars went to the Pork Barrel Spending.† This should have been done when Obama took office.† There was nothing done except for the bank, AIG, GM,Ford, and all the rest of the unnecessary spending, especially when GM and Chrysler went bankrupt.† The American people could do a better job than any of the people at the White House have done.† I will fight until the bitter end about Universal Health Care and they go over our heads and pass this anyway, I believe there will be an uprising with the American people and there will be the biggest protesting party.††You think the TEA Parties are small just wait until Obama passes all these things all the way thru.†† The American people have been messed on long enough,† and enough is enough.†

I have a handicapped daughter and the caregiver she used to have told me recently that their next door neighbor worked in construction, but the man couldn't find work and they†were about to lose their house. Sandra is the woman that was my daughter caregiver and a real estate agent and tried to sell this couples house for them.† They got an offer on the house, but the bank wouldn't let them take that off, so finally the bank took these people's house away from them, and this couple had to leave everything in that house and left that house with nothing except their vehicles.† Sandra was so upset about this she was crying and had written to Obama about these people.† That Stimulus bill was suppose to help people like this couple and every one else that were have these problems, but someone told a big fat lie and did nothing for these people.† I honestly believe the White Houe is so confused about how to even balance a budget or how to even spend the money the way it should be spend.† I have never been so outraged in my life and so disappointed that I think we will be in the soup line before the first of 2010.† Obama will not listen to the American people and 95% of the American people do not won't Universal Health Care nor neither do they want this Cap and Trade and where has it gotten.† Harry Reid got this Cap & Trade slipped thru Congress one night this pass week.† We are the Taxpayers and we ought to decide what needs to be done, but that isn't the way they want it.† If they don't get their act together I'm afraid there is going to be an uprising like there is in Iran.† It looks like it is headed that way. One of the TV talk show host mentioned it last week.† Think about it.

Gov. Bev Perdue today signed Senate Bill 799 to increase the transparency of state mental health, developmental disability and substance abuse facilities by making more information in death records public.

> Gov. Perdue Calls for Closer Safety Oversight of Coal Ash Ponds

Gov. Perdue this week†urged state lawmakers to pass legislation that would increase the safety oversight of coal ash ponds in North Carolina.† The legislation would subject the dams that create coal ash ponds to direct inspection by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources.

> ìBecause of where some of the ponds are located, greater safety oversight and more frequent inspections will help reduce potential risks,î said Perdue.

> A ìhigh hazardî designation was created in the 1980ís for coal ash impoundments and other similar dams that are near densely populated areas or downstream water supplies because of the potential impact of a damís failure.† The designation does not reflect the structural condition of the dam.

> Currently, power companies are only required to file reports every five years by private engineers on the structural conditions of the dams.† The impoundments are exempt from regulation under the N.C. Dam Safety Act.

> The proposal will be sponsored by Rep. Pricey Harrison of Greensboro and will subject coal ash dams to the Dam Safety Act, which would more closely regulate the impoundments and would require a state inspection every two years.

Visitor: Mr. Shannon Bryson

Address: 52 Oakdale Rd, Cheraw, SC 29520

Email: sbryson5@yahoo.com

Subject: Yale Industry (Coffing Hoists, Wadesboro, N.C.)

Comment: Governor Perdue, My name is Shannon Bryson, I was employed as a Process Engineer at Coffing Hoists in Wadesboro for three years. I was laid off on February 27, 2009 due to cut-backs. I was so thrilled to see this article and was wondering if you could tell me more about the requirements. Since my layoff was due to cutbacks and not performance, does that mean I may be able to get my old job back? I have frantically searced for work since February with no luck. I am the father/step-father of four children and my wife is a full-time student at Coker College as an Elementary Education major. At the time of my layoff, I was the sole provider in my home. Needless to say, it has been really tough making ends meet with no relief in sight. In our county alone (Chesterfield, SC) the unemployment rate is 18.1% as of July...not very encouraging numbers! I just wanted to thank you and whoever else is responsible for this wonderful news...hopefully it will apply to me!

Dear Governor Perdue,
I know you have a whole bunch of things that are more important on your 'to do' list, but I really wanted to let you know of something that we are personally experiencing in the hope that the law is reconsidered some. †
We recently had a fella we trust house-sit our home. †He let a friend into the home, not knowing that he was a 16-some repeat offender in this area. †Well, needless to say, he stole us blind - everything sentimental, everything and anything of value. †Yes, my heart is broken, but that is not what I'm writing about. †We immediately called the Sheriff of Orange County and they immediately engaged their Investigator (Tim Horne - a 20 year veteran in this state) ... they know who the guy is, †they know his record (Mathew Kenning - also convicted for sexual crimes) - but they can't even do a search or get tough on the guy because the law, if you can believe it, protects criminals more than it does look after law abiding citizens like ourselves. †This has got to be wrong? †I would like your view on this and how, in all seriousness, we hope to address crime (which always starts petty) becoming a real issue in our town. †The law enforcement teams also feel powerless - how can this be. †This is wrong.
Thank you for your time and I look forward to your response.†
Kind Regards
Mrs Debra Buxton

I have written the governor a couple of times and haven't heard sorry I don't care or anything.If we get another email from your office without any help or acknowledgment I am switching parties. One thing I've learned is no one is in your corner unless they want something. Well my family desperately wants something now. Let's see how this grass roots thing works.

In addition, the state and federal government offer tax advantages on the purchase of some major home appliances.† North Carolina also offers a sales tax free holiday weekend on the purchase of some ENERGY STAR products.† This year it is scheduled for Friday, Nov. 6, through Sunday, Nov. 8.

Gov. Perdue Calls for Closer Safety Oversight of Coal Ash Ponds

Gov. Perdue this week†urged state lawmakers to pass legislation that would increase the safety oversight of coal ash ponds in North Carolina.† The legislation would subject the dams that create coal ash ponds to direct inspection by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources.
‚ÄúBecause of where some of the ponds are located, greater safety oversight and more frequent inspections will help reduce potential risks,‚Äù said Perdue.
A ‚Äúhigh hazard‚Äù designation was created in the 1980‚Äôs for coal ash impoundments and other similar dams that are near densely populated areas or downstream water supplies because of the potential impact of a dam‚Äôs failure.† The designation does not reflect the structural condition of the dam.
Currently, power companies are only required to file reports every five years by private engineers on the structural conditions of the dams.† The impoundments are exempt from regulation under the N.C. Dam Safety Act.
The proposal will be sponsored by Rep. Pricey Harrison of Greensboro and will subject coal ash dams to the Dam Safety Act, which would more closely regulate the impoundments and would require a state inspection every two years.

> Gov. Perdue Signs Bill to Increase Transparency in State Mental Health Facilities

Gov. Bev Perdue today signed Senate Bill 799 to increase the transparency of state mental health, developmental disability and substance abuse facilities by making more information in death records public. Perdue proposed this legislation in March with Attorney General Roy Cooper. It was sponsored by Sen. Rand (D-Bladen, Cumberland).†

> ìThis legislation puts the safety of our patients first by ensuring that important information in death records is available to the public,î said Perdue. ìBy increasing transparency, we will make state facilities more accountable to the people in their care, restore public confidence and rebuild public trust.î

> Senate Bill 799 will require the following information regarding deaths in state facilities to be public information:

> - The name, sex, age and date of birth of the deceased;†
> - The name of the facility providing the report;†
> - The date, time and location of the death;†
> - A brief description of the circumstances of death, including the manner of death if known; and†
> - A list of all entities to whom the event was reported.

> ìMore disclosure can shine a light on problems and help ensure patientsí safety.† Our investigators and prosecutors will continue to enforce the law against those who abuse patients in state facilities,î said Cooper.

> ìTransforming the stateís facilities into a true system of care is foremost, and part of that transformation means operating in a climate of transparency.î said DHHS Secretary Lanier Cansler. ìWhile we want to make sure we protect the rights of the individuals we serve, we also want to make sure the public has access to information about our facilities and our plans to correct areas of deficiencies.î

> North Carolina to Receive $8.8 Million to Help Citizens Buy Energy-Efficient Appliances

Gov. Bev Perdue this week†announced that North Carolina is in line to receive $8.8 million in federal funds to help homeowners purchase energy-efficient appliances, from furnaces and room air conditioners to refrigerators and dishwashers.† The money for ENERGY STAR rated appliances would be distributed through a program to be developed by the Energy Office along with the N.C. Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.

> The funds are part of nearly $300 million from the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act being distributed nationwide by the U.S. Department of Energy.

> ìAffordable, energy efficient appliances are not only good for the environment, they cut energy costs for consumers and create more business for retailers,î said Perdue. ìThese recovery funds will help boost our green economy, and make North Carolina a more environmentally friendly state.î

Comment: Mrs. Perdue, You are aware of what I have been made to endure as an American citizen, and how I have to fight for my life by a sick game and how they publicly try me, persecute me and control my life, I want to know the facts, i want to know who, why and what for. I have a voice, no one can that that from anyone, no one can take the US constitution form anyone and yet they have me, why is that? Why do they get to control my life, why do they get to debate, try me without any defense. I have begged for some answeres for years and yet no one gives me any? I don't understand this at all! I have rights, I have a right to know who did what to me and why. I can't keep living this way, I can't keep going through this hell that society puts me through, what is my life to anyone, what is my work to anyone, they steal my work, and claimed that I did this or that, when I have done nothing at all but want a betterlife for me and my kids. What, who and why has no one stopped this corruption.

Comment: the applied mesothelioma research foundation is working hard to find a cure for this deadly disease. Since there are individuals in North Carolina who suffer from this disease would the State of North Carolina make a l00 thousand donation to support the research I recently had a brother 42 who passed away 7 weeks after being diagnosed. Asbestos is found in many places--brakes, plumbing houses, businesses. etc. Thanks for the consideration.

Subject: Economy - high interest rates charged by credit card company

Comment: This is a copy of my email to Vice President Biden‚Äôs Task Force on preserving the Middle Class and also sent to Chase Mastercard in a request to lower the interest rate they have charged on my account. Thank goodness I kept my "day" job, because even though it has been difficult to live on a fourth of my earnings (commissions on real estate sales) for the past 18 months, I still get a paycheck and health insurance benefits. I realize that many people are not so fortunate. However, my regular salary is stretched thin, and because I was late making a payment (okay maybe two) on a credit card, the credit card company has hiked my interest rate up to 30%!!! The other banks have followed suit and upped interest rates from 24 to 27%. I have a long standing credit history with a so-called score of 725, but it makes no difference. I have written to request that they lower the rate, but they have refused. I believe that the merchants whose goods I used to buy on credit would be outraged. This practice is predatory and unfair and ultimately stops spending, which stagnates the economy. I am going to share this post with my next request to reduce rates. Thank you for the opportunity to voice my opinion.

> The bill enables local education agencies to administer $275,772,000 in bonding authority for new, qualified school construction bonds (QSCB) and gives $56,699,000 in bonding authority to continue qualified zone academy bonds (QZAB).
> 
> The federal government already identified five North Carolina counties with low-income school districts that will receive money through QSCB as a result of the bill:
> 
> Mecklenburg County - $25,962,000
> Forsyth County - $12,244,000
> Guilford County - $17,147,000
> Wake County - $17,304,000
> Cumberland County - $15,948,000
> 
> The State Board of Education has administered QZAB since 1997. To apply for QZAB, individual schools must have 35 percent of their student population receiving free or reduced lunch.  This money can only be used for repair and renovation and requires school districts to partner with businesses that will match 10 percent of the bond's face-value through cash or in-kind contributions.
> 
> The QSCB is a new bond program created through the ARRA that provides money for repair, renovation and new construction.  There are no prerequisites for applying, and it does not require a business match.

> State Home Foreclosure Prevention Project Prevents More Than 1,000 Foreclosures in NC
> 
> Gov. Perdue and the N.C. Office of the Commissioner of Banks (NCCOB) this week announced that the State Home Foreclosure Prevention Project has helped more than 1,000 North Carolina homeowners avoid foreclosure since the program's inception in November 2008.
> 
> "North Carolina is committed to helping our citizens avoid foreclosure," said Gov. Perdue.  "This program is critical to many families in our state as we continue to do all we can to help homeowners stay in their homes."
> 
> Working with major mortgage companies, non-profit service providers, and state agencies, NCCOB developed a program to notify homeowners nearing foreclosure proceedings early and to make it easier for homeowners to access the existing network of over 150 certified housing counselors across the state.  The NC Foreclosure Project also provides an opportunity for homeowners to have their subprime loans reviewed for potential violations of law by NCCOB-trained volunteers, who help NCCOB identify instances of suspected predatory lending and refer them to private or public enforcement.  A network of legal service providers is available to assist homeowners referred by counseling agencies to provide further review of loans or foreclosure defense.  In addition, NCCOB staff monitors the progress of loan work-outs to address communication breakdowns between housing counselors and mortgage companies.
> 
> In the first seven months of operation, the program has prevented more than 1,000 foreclosures and connected more than 3,000 homeowners to housing counseling agencies for foreclosure prevention counseling.  The economic impact of the program to date is estimated at $86 million.
> 
> German Firm to Open U.S. HQ in Charlotte
> 
> Teupen, a global leader in the design and manufacture of track-mounted aerial work platforms, will open its U.S. headquarters, services and spare parts operations in Mecklenburg County.  The company has leased a 10,000-square-foot industrial building in Charlotte and is creating 10 jobs immediately, while planning to expand further in the next two years.
> 
> "North Carolina is seen internationally as a prime place to locate and tap into the North American market," Gov. Perdue said.  "Our state's forward-looking policies continue to attract leading global companies looking to invest and expand, thanks to our top-rated business climate, strategic transportation assets, and highly skilled workers."
> 
> Teupen, pronounced TOY-pen, is a world leader in the design and manufacture of track-mounted aerial work platforms used for applications ranging from tree-trimming to maintenance of large industrial facilities and building interiors.  The company's platforms offer precise, stable and portable access to hard-to-reach work areas on a variety of surfaces including sand, lawns, uneven pavement and any interior flooring.
> 
> The Charlotte Chamber and N.C. Department of Commerce assisted Teupen with various aspects of the project. For more information on Teupen, please visit the company's web site at www.teupen.com<http://www.teupen.com>.

Although this company would supply some jobs for NC, it also will create toxic byproducts, as plastic production does. Where will this toxic waste go? Plus reviewing its clients list reveals that many of these companies test on animals. What are we promoting? We all know that Clorox produces extremely toxic materials/chemicals.....this is certainly NOT greening our planet but doing the absolute opposite. What is this saying about our state, our government and our disrespectful practices in harming this earth, our home.

Subject: complaint

Comment: My name is Dina Kaminska, I want to make an appointment with the governor Ted Kulongoski because with me act not legal. In magazine was write that in USA has a human s right. But with me everywhere act not legal. My two thrombosis were pulled out and stopped in my lungs. In hospital they gave me a tablets for blood thinning. And my blood norm was high 4.5 and 5.1, and I didn‚Äôt know about this, until I went to hospital and said that my blood norm was high. And I was with that norm like 7 -8 months. My blood pressure is 200/120 and 220/140. I have illness of heart, and it s very hard to breath. I gave an application for SSI and I got a refuse. On the second time I took a lawyer , but he didn‚Äôt help me. And third time I gave an application for SSI, but they make me to take a lawyer again. So I said that they have to do it without lawyer. They make me sign papers, but it not the same paper that what they are talk about. I read your instruction there was written, that each person should be happy and have the right to safety. People following me ,I am afraid to leave the house . I had one woman and has brought tablets to me, and I felt very bad from them, it seemed to me that I die. I live with a daughter to it of 15 years, the husband has died. We together receive 448 dollars, I asked for help me for rent to pay for my apartment but they said that they don‚Äòt have money. In bank I would ask 4 months that sent me the report every month, and they do not want. Gruy Vasyl my father provided phone with benefits with out any functions, he wanted only define, and with define they took from us $20. We call and they speak that next month will remove, but they do not remove. We wanted only define, and they take more than it costs. We have removed all functions and they take 12.80 and from friends without functions 9 $. In the Soviet union have arrested father‚Äôs brother for 25 years, and he was gone without messages, and other brother for 10 years, mother‚Äôs brother for 10 years ,then they mock my father, then me and my children. I thought that all remains behind, and I do not know why with me so act. I need the enterpreter Russian. My phone number is 503 257 5913. I wanted to go in the line to 8th program but they said that on 8th program they don‚Äôt put in the line. When we were in wellfare and for signed papers, and we signed that we in one year have to get 10, 000$. I didn‚Äôt get my taxes and my father did not too, but we pay for rent every month. Everybody said that we should not get taxes. And nobody didn‚Äôt pay us 300$ from president Obama and 250$ from him. They are making me to do the hearing about SSI. In the statement I wrote what I want.

Subject: criminal case

Comment: 2544 Shelton Avenue Hudson North Carolina 28638 September, 2008 Dear Sir or Madam: I moved out of New York 17 years ago because I was being robbed and stalked by troopers. I now Live in North Carolina and I am having trouble again. When I lived in New York the troopers bugged my house and said disgusting things to me. They said to spread my legs and McGreer said go masturbate and think of him.Trooper McGreer and other troopers said tuck in your tummy and spread your legs. Trooper Antionio laughed and said I was going to be a victim again. Trooper Mc Greer would discuss with his friends in my house about me having my period. One of them said at 42 years old I was too old to have my period any more. Mc Greer told one of his friends to go in my house and get one of my bloody kotex. I was walking around my house in my underwear one day and all of them were making all kinds of remarks. I ran and put on my bathrobe. One of them said how would you like to help me put Janet away. Can‚Äôt you see how dangerous and perverted they are? The 2 troopers are stalking me again. Their names are Trooper Antionio and Trooper Mc Greer. They are also getting in my house and taking my things(or it could be one of there friends getting in my house all the time). I am disabled and live on a fixed income and can not afford for them to keep taking from me. They come in when ever they want and steal from me. They stole medical records, bank statements, tax papers, clothing, coins, jewelry and food. I have reported this to the sheriff and nothing can be done so far,but it is on record. About 8 months ago they got in my house and put holes in all my underwear, then two months later stole all of my underwear. The troopers have enlisted punks to help them with this crime. If they are doing this all to me, I‚Äôm sure they have done it to other women and maybe even children. In New York they both badgered and harassed me along with some of their friends. I was hoping to have peace here in North Carolina but they won‚Äôt leave me alone. I am getting phone calls that they are going to drive me insane and put me away in Creedmore State hospital in New York if it is the last thing they ever do. For 17 years now the troopers are mentally torturing me. The technology is here now for them to do it and we both know it. For seventeen years they have been some how putting voices in my house day and night. They are calling me dirty names and trying to degrade me in every way they can. They never stop. They said they are going to make me insane if it is the last thing they do. I don‚Äôt know how they are getting the voices in my house, but I know it can be done. This is not legal to do. They have also been vandalizing my car. They scratched it all up. These troopers orchestrated the whole thing. I also owned a Viet Nam Monument in New York and the town harassed me for 10 years over it. The town said they owned it. I have the blue prints to it and I paid the mortgage and taxes and up keep on it. The mayor of the town Ron Scott called me and badgered me over it all the time. I even went to the Judge in the town Mark Berensen for help and he said that Erwin Muller shook hands with some dead man and that Erwin Muller owned it . I called the state troopers for help and they said call a lawyer. The troopers never enforced the laws in New York. Susan Thompson would bring her lawyer Dennis Greenwald at Christmas with a mob of people on my property with candles to sing to the monument, which was against my Christian beliefs. It was so offensive to me. Before I left the town I told them all off and defended the real estate laws of the country and they didn‚Äôt like that at all. They tried to destroy me for it. Erwin Muller stole the monument on a Sunday in 1991 while I was home praying. I am so traumatized that I can‚Äôt remember what Trooper Mc Greer looks like. I know that voice of his even after 17 years. I can‚Äôt sleep at night. Now I have to go to a doctor for sleeping pills. I have always been a law biding citizen and an outstanding member of the community and I will defend the laws of the country until the day I die. I can‚Äôt afford to fight them I don‚Äôt have a lot of money. Is there a way you can help me. If you don‚Äôt believe me, make them all take a polygraph test and you‚Äôll find out I am telling you the truth. They said they are all jealous and are doing this for the fun of it and they are going to ruin me to satisfy their selves. Please help me get them out of my life. This isn‚Äôt even the complete story of what New Yorkers have done to me. I spoke to a detective that has been in the business of security for 25 years with the government and he said it is possible to put a house under observation from 700 miles away. He said all of this is possible even putting voices in some ones house. He said there are many ways of doing it. It can be done with computers, satellites, electronic devices and other ways. I also have a signed statement from the detective. I have no privacy and they stripped me of my human rights. I‚Äôve been all over NY and NC with my statement trying to get help. I finally got to be with intelligent, classy and smart people in the South and these criminals won‚Äôt leave me alone. As God is my witness this is the truth. At least contact me and let me know what you can do. I have suffered enough for absolutely no reason. I am suing New York State for $800,000,000.00 for putting me through this disgusting crime. I am so devastated and traumatized over this disgusting crime I have to take sleeping pills now to get some rest. I also have numbness in my face now to because of these disgusting people. Do something about these people and stop making excuses for them. Do you condone their ludicrous crimes? Why are you letting these flunkies get away with this crime. I contacted NYS court system and they said NCS has jurisdiction over this case. Sincerely, Janet Stevenson

Comment: Governor Purdue, As a citizen of North Carolina, I want to commend you on the great job you are doing during a very difficult time in our state. I have followed the "state of the state" closely and the decisions you have made. Although I have little to no experience in government, I have a strong desire to be part of the efforts that are being made to get through these tough economic times. I currently am the Administrative Assistant to the Superintendent of Yancey County Schools in Burnsville, NC. I definitely have an interest on what is going on with the state budget. On a personal basis, I am doing everything I can to ease my financial woes as well as those of my community, my county and my state. If there is a need for me to serve on a committee or assist your office on a local level here in Yancey County, please let me know. Although I am a registered Republican, I am first and foremost a North Carolinian and an American. My political affiliation really comes second to my love of my state and my country. Thank you again for your dedication to North Carolina.

> Gov. Perdue Signs Bill to Increase Transparency in State Mental Health Facilities

Gov. Bev Perdue today signed Senate Bill 799 to increase the transparency of state mental health, developmental disability and substance abuse facilities by making more information in death records public. Perdue proposed this legislation in March with Attorney General Roy Cooper. It was sponsored by Sen. Rand (D-Bladen, Cumberland).†

> ìThis legislation puts the safety of our patients first by ensuring that important information in death records is available to the public,î said Perdue. ìBy increasing transparency, we will make state facilities more accountable to the people in their care, restore public confidence and rebuild public trust.î

> Senate Bill 799 will require the following information regarding deaths in state facilities to be public information:

> - The name, sex, age and date of birth of the deceased;†
> - The name of the facility providing the report;†
> - The date, time and location of the death;†

> North Carolina to Receive $8.8 Million to Help Citizens Buy Energy-Efficient Appliances

Gov. Bev Perdue this week†announced that North Carolina is in line to receive $8.8 million in federal funds to help homeowners purchase energy-efficient appliances, from furnaces and room air conditioners to refrigerators and dishwashers.† The money for ENERGY STAR rated appliances would be distributed through a program to be developed by the Energy Office along with the N.C. Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.

> The funds are part of nearly $300 million from the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act being distributed nationwide by the U.S. Department of Energy.

> ìAffordable, energy efficient appliances are not only good for the environment, they cut energy costs for consumers and create more business for retailers,î said Perdue. ìThese recovery funds will help boost our green economy, and make North Carolina a more environmentally friendly state.î

> The federal Energy Department is recommending that states focus the rebate program efforts on heating and cooling equipment, appliances and water heaters, since these products offer the greatest energy saving potential.

> In addition, the state and federal government offer tax advantages on the purchase of some major home appliances.† North Carolina also offers a sales tax free holiday weekend on the purchase of some ENERGY STAR products.† This year it is scheduled for Friday, Nov. 6, through Sunday, Nov. 8.

> For more information on the federal ENERGY STAR rebate program, visit <http://www.energy.gov/recovery>www.energy.gov/recovery.†

> Gov. Perdue Calls for Closer Safety Oversight of Coal Ash Ponds

Gov. Perdue this week†urged state lawmakers to pass legislation that would increase the safety oversight of coal ash ponds in North Carolina.† The legislation would subject the dams that create coal ash ponds to direct inspection by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources.

> ìBecause of where some of the ponds are located, greater safety oversight and more frequent inspections will help reduce potential risks,î said Perdue.

> A ìhigh hazardî designation was created in the 1980ís for coal ash impoundments and other similar dams that are near densely populated areas or downstream water supplies because of the potential impact of a damís failure.† The designation does not reflect the structural condition of the dam.

> Currently, power companies are only required to file reports every five years by private engineers on the structural conditions of the dams.† The impoundments are exempt from regulation under the N.C. Dam Safety Act.

> The proposal will be sponsored by Rep. Pricey Harrison of Greensboro and will subject coal ash dams to the Dam Safety Act, which would more closely regulate the impoundments and would require a state inspection every two years.

Subject: 48 for Larry

Comment: Hi, I am writing in regards to the cancellation on medicaid for Larry Hamm. After finding out he needed a surgery or have 18 months to live, your state all of a sudden realized that his family had too much income for medicaid. ($380 a week for a family of 3) So your state has sentenced him to death in 18 months (that's what his doctors give him) for what reason? A few bucks. Sincerely, Casandra Adkins-Baileys http://blockheadradiolive.com/48forlarry Your state may not care but we do.

Subject: Marine Fuel

Comment: I am writing to inform you of what I am finding out is a very real and expensive problem for boat owners who use gasoline. As I am sure you know, gas is now being blended with 10% ethanol. This blending doesn't seam to cause to much of a problem for cars, but it has caused many boaters very big problems with there boats. After reading several articles on the subject and speaking with Yamaha Motors I have found out the following about the ethanol blended fuel: besides not being as stable as the gasoline we were using it tends to dissolve varnishes that have built up on the inside of fuel tanks. These dissolved materials are fine enough to pass through the 10 micron water/fuel separators that protect many boat motors, and allows them to enter the motors and fowl fuel injectors. A smaller filtration system can not be installed on the motors because it strains and damages the fuel pump on the motor. I personally have experienced this problem. I am finding out that it isn't a fix it once and move on kind of thing. I have twin 4 stroke 2005 Yamaha 150 HP outboards. At the beginning of July ''09 I had Joe's Marine replace all the filters & clean the fuel injectors of both motors, because they had lost power and were running very poorly. I was informed by Joe's Marine that the problem was caused by the ethanol blended fuel. Rather than take a chance and run the remaining 90 gallons of fuel through the motors I contacted USA Fuels and had them pump out and clean my fuel tank. At first the motors ran great, but after only 1 tank of fuel my boat motors are already experiencing the same problems I had before I had the repairs done. I have lost 15% of the RPMs at top end on my port motor and 12% of the RPMs on my starboard motor. It cost me $720 to get my motors repaired the first time and $330 to get my fuel tank pumped out and cleaned. Add in the 90 gallons of fuel that was removed at $2.50 a gallon that's $225, and you can see were talking $1,275. If this was a one time expense, I wouldn't like it, but I would deal with it and move on. But it doesn't seam to be a one time thing because its happening again less than 1 tank of fuel after the repairs and only 2 weeks after the repairs. I use my boat for recreational use. I enjoy fishing and spending time with my family and friends on the water. I have lived on the water all my life. I can only imagine the frustrations the commercial fisherman are going through who work the sound fishing areas. I understand that the ethanol blending was initiated for environmental reasons and for automobiles it seams to work alright. However, it is not working out for marine engines. It can't be reducing my carbon foot print if my motors aren't operating efficiently, needing expensive repairs, and fuel is being thrown out because it is breaking down in as little as 90 days. There has to be a better way of dealing with this fuel issue. Anything you and your staff could do with regards to this matter would be helpful. Thank you for your time. Regards, Matthew Lowcher 216 Windjammer Rd. Nags Head, NC 27959 252-256-1330

Subject: State budget and foreclosures

Comment: My husband's business of 27 yrs. had to be sold out in Oct. '08. Since that time, he hasn't had a full time job in construction. Due to this, our home is 8 payments behind on the mortgage, and will soon be in the foreclosure process. He is willing to take a full time position anywhere in the State. I work for the State as a social worker. I have applied to numerous agencies to relocate all across the State, but due to the freeze on employment, the agencies cannot fill positions unless it is absolutely necessary at this time. My request is more of a plea to please come to some kind of conclusion on the budget so that State agencies can open up opportunities of employment to those in need. My son also graduated from UNCG in May '08 with a teaching degree. Unfortunately, our State has had so many lay offs in that area that he has taken a position of employment in another State in sales / management. Who would have thought education would ever take a cut! I actually encouraged him to go into education because it is a rewarding and "stable" position of employment. Can you give our State any kind of hope of a release within the next week? Thank you, Theresa Beam SW III / Adoptions

Subject: I need a pass port to keep my job, pay child support, exc.

Comment: I have an issue were I‚Äôm stuck with risk of losing my job which would be paying a tremendous salary, because I haven't been able to get a pass port due to rears owed on child support to my kids mother and not the state of North Carolina. I was paying some month $575.00 plus an extra $500.00 up until the time of me finding out around June 17, 09 I was going to lose my job due to the Cumberland County Child Support system SOP. So far the Company has been working with me, and being patient with my current situation, though their losing money. I have spoke with everyone high and low in the NC Cumberland County Child Support systems. At the time the only thing I could do was fallow what the case worker stated, which was to fill a motions to go to court for my wife to state in front of a judge that she is dropping rears, which she agreed to do. Jill Hernly the case work at the time told me I would be given the court date of July 29, 09. I filled out the paper work correctly by what info the form request and submitted a motion to be seen in court on July 29, 09. I now have received word that I have a new case worker, and the closest court date I will be given is Aug 19, 09. I also was told there wasn‚Äôt any dates available before the July 29, 09 court date, and have found out the child support case are handle every Wednesday and Thursday, and that any case worker could have handle my small matter. Cumberland County, well maybe even the state of NC Child Support system needs to be reviewed. I also have nice things that I could say about the Cumberland County / NC Child Support systems, but they are not the things that are keeping me from taking care of my kids and me. I‚Äôm not just some father that is lazy, unemployed or working and don‚Äôt take care of their children. This is not the only problem I have had with the NC child support system, rules, and process. I have tried to get all the child support case workers and supervisors e-mail address working in to Cumberland County office who have been involved in this matter, so they could receive a copy of this same letter. I need help please respond and help in any way possible before I lose this opportunity to do something big for my kids and myself.

Dear Mrs. Perdue, I'm sorry to bother you again. I finally got my license back and I thank you so very much. I paid $150 to CDM Assessment and $75 to NCDMV. I got a receipt from CDM but I was told I wouldn't get one from the NCDMV. How will I prove that I took care of this if I don't have some kind of documentation. Ten years down the road if something happens tp the computer system and it pops back up like it did after just nine years this time what will I do. If you could get me some kind of document or better yet pardon me for a mistake I made when I was young stupid so I don't have to go through this again. Thanks again Donald E. Espy

 Pathway to a Balanced Budget
 
Yesterday, I presented lawmakers with a clear pathway to a balanced budget that raises the revenue necessary to protect public schools and other core services in health and public safety. Combined with $3.8 billion in cuts, the pathway modernizes the state tax code in a way that is fair to working families. 
Those steps include targeted tax relief to middle-class families, along with child, family and home-related credits. It also outlines permanent reductions to sales, income and business tax rates. 
With the fiscal year already a week old, local governments, schools, service providers and families across North Carolina are in limbo regarding what resources and services will be available to them. 
I continue to urge the General Assembly to work quickly to pass a budget that protects public schools and other vital services, and I have provided them with a clear pathway to do so. 
We cannot allow this recession to devastate our children's education and our state's future, and I hope you will join me as we continue to take that message to the General Assembly.
