Dear Governor Perdue:  A year and a half ago, I picketed at the back of the Durham PD.  The Durham PD and City Hall refused to advise me of picket permit requirements and use-of-force procedures.  That is a prima facie violation of my Constitutional rights. I picketed anyway and was scared to death. I believe the evidence will show that the command staff intended to put me in fear.  Lopez was well-briefed even before he came to Durham.   I reported to every level of law enforcement in the state: Lopez, Hodge, 30 members of the command staff, Sheriff Hill, County Attorney Kitchen, and Attorney General Roy Cooper to get help in getting permit and use-of-force proceudres.  In addition, I requested the help of several attorneys: Baker, Sindelair, Clement, Kitchen, and your Attorney general Cooper.  Noone did anything even as I exercised my right to speak in deathly fear at the back of the PD.    Mr. McMillan, President of the NC Bar is
 in receipt of the details, as is the FBI and the people cc:d above.  I am getting stonewalled and stonewalled.  I made a very reasonable request below, and these people seem to be having an issue with dealing with me, contrary to public records law.  I am a JD but cannot find a lawyer. I am also being treated unfairly since I would love to have a lawyer but am unemployed, so I got to DIY.  I have requested an Internal Affairs investigation of the PD and the FBI and filed a complaint against several attorneys with the Bar, including your Attorney General Cooper.   I have requested a RICO investigation based on Obstruction of Justice and the civil rights conspiracy statute.  Madame Governor, the Duke Lacrosse legacy will never be over until Durham is cleaned up. How can you help?  Respectfully, Rachel Kindred, JD

Sincerely,
Rachel Kindred

I notice from the organizational charts on the DPD website that Captain Evans is no longer the District 5 commander as he was a year and a half ago nor is he the Executive Officer to Bev Council anymore...the only reference to him is on the obviously outdated contact list, he was taken off the organizational charts...was he forced to retire?  was he subjected to any disciplinary action?  was he subject to an internal affairs investigation?  was he directed down to manage me by Hodge?  Was he acting on orders?  From whom?   What orders was he acting on?   Was he interviewed?  Why are Internal Affairs complaints against regular officers public and complaints against the command staff not?   Why was I not given a status report of my complaints as is procedure stated by the Durham PD's own policies?  Did anyone from the City Council, city Attorney, or City Manager communicate with anyone at the PD about the complaints I raised?   Mr.
Bonfield, please tell me the procedures I need to follow (format) to get a complete documentary record.  Obviously, no lawsuit has been filed, so this entire matter is outside the scope of the litigation process, including claims of governmental immunity.  As far as I'm concerned, this is a criminal matter.  If the FBI will send me an email that these questions are being addressed and the documentary record being requested, then I will merely ask for a duplicate of everything that is turned over to them in that investigation....Mr. McMillan, what is the status of my complaints to the Bar about the attorneys in question:  Baker, Clement, Blinder, Sindelair, Kitchen, Cooper, the Police Attorneys?  FBI, has an Internal Affairs investigation been launched?  What's the delay?

Sincerely,

Happy birthday to me.  Being a woman for me has meant living with almost 30  years of violence.  It's Post Traumatic Stress Disorder that never is "post."  Reread this if you would as a birthday present to me.  I am somebody, not a nothing as y'all would prefer me to believe.

ENDING MEN'S VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
By Ted Bunch
My most memorable experience of what a full sense of privilege probably feels like was when I first received myE-Z Pass for my car. E-Z Pass is a device that allows tolls to be automatically deducted from the driver’s accountso that cash is not needed and therefore you get processed through tolls much faster when traveling. As Iapproached the toll, the tollgate began to rise and I drove through with no delay. I looked back at the long line of
cars in the cash lane. I remember thinking as I watched the gate rise for me to pass that this must be what it is liketo be a white man in America. I had access and privileges that made me feel welcome and preferred.
My male privilege as a black man is different; it does not go everywhere I go. For instance, if the police stop mewhile I am driving my car, I instinctively know to keep my hands on the steering wheel at the 10:00 and 2:00 position. I don’t believe that the average white male experiences the police in the same way. This is because his
male privilege is directly connected to and cannot be separated from his race privilege. However, even men ofcolor, while being marginalized by racism, continue to experience the privileges and entitlements associated with
being male. The benefit of this privilege operates in virtually every household, from the oldest male member to
the youngest male child. Our privilege consists of rights, power and advantages given to men by men. Men control
these rights and monitor them often at the expense of women.
Naming The Problem: Domestic violence, rape, sexual assault and all forms of violence against women are the
manifestation of sexism. The violence and abuse by men toward women is rooted in our history, our laws and
woven into the fabric of our society. It must be contextualized within the construct of sexism, because male
privilege, patriarchy and misogyny support this violence. The privileges, entitlements and advantage that we as
men receive from the existing social and political construct provide us with support to act in overtly and covertly
demeaning, oppressive, controlling and abusive ways toward women. Our culture and norms are founded on the
belief that women have less value than men, and that the role of women is for the benefit, use, entertainment and
pleasure of men.
For many years, concerned citizens, activists, advocates and many other dedicated people have made great efforts
to end men’s violence against women. The anti-rape and sexual assault community as well as the domestic
violence community have been a tremendous change agent and have made remarkable progress in the effort to
create safety, justice and fairness for women. Unfortunately, despite years of great effort, sacrifice and loss of life,
the terror that women experience has not decreased. Men continue to get away with their violence, abuse,
intimidation as well as the misuse of power for the purpose of controlling and dominating women. This is no
reflection on those communities or any other effort for change. However, it is a reflection on men and the lack of
concern that we as men have for most issues affecting women. This is especially disturbing because the pain,
suffering, exploitation and immeasurable loss that women experience is almost always due to violence and abuse
at the hands of men.
Domestic violence, rape and sexual assault are the most devastating health issues and social problems facing our
society. There is no other problem, disease or illness that claims as many victims. In almost every case the
perpetrator is a male and the victim is a female. No other crime or social ill has such a destructive effect on
families, children, communities or the workplace than men’s violence against women. For this reason, if for no
other, it is vital that men become involved in the effort to end men’s violence against women. Each man
individually, and we as men collectively, must take a stand and own up to our responsibility to challenge other
men and end the violence that we allow to be perpetrated against women in our communities.
1
The American Medical Association estimates that almost 4 million men severely assault their intimate female
partner or spouse each year. Men’s violence against their intimate female partner is the leading cause of injury for
women, and is the cause of at least 35% of all emergency room visits. Every day approximately 4 men kill their
present or former intimate female partner. As many as 75% of those men murder the women they were partnered
with during or after a separation. It is estimated that 25% of men batter during a woman’s pregnancy. The U.S.
Department of Justice reports that men will rape 1 out of 6 women and commit more than 300,000 acts of rape
and sexual assault every year. It is estimated that 84% of rape and sexual assault goes unreported. In addition,
more than 80% of those women and girls will be under the age of 25. It is a fact that more than 3 out of 4 rapists
will know the women they rape. In fact there is not a moment or second during any day that men are not violating,
assaulting or exploiting women. Men are responsible for a multi-billion dollar industry that supports and promotes
the commercial sexual exploitation, enslavement and trafficking of women. There is no time that women are safe
or free from fear.
If we as men choose not to become involved in ending our violence against women it is because we choose to
remain invested in maintaining our privilege and advantage. Our privileges and entitlements can only come at the
expense of women. Any violence, abuse or degradation committed toward a woman by a man supports the status
of men as the dominating group while also reinforcing the oppression of women. There is no neutral position or
stance for men to take. We can either choose to become part of the solution or remain part of the problem.
The Use of Accountable Language: Violence against women is a violation of human rights. If any group were to
attack another group of people who are law abiding, peaceful, loving and productive members of a society, the
group that was the aggressor would be brought up on human rights violations. Here in the United States men,
women and children are socialized to protect the status of men. We protect men in our language and our
terminology. We almost always frame the issue of domestic violence and violence against women as a “women’s
issue”. By categorizing domestic violence, rape, sexual assault and other forms of violence against women as a
"women’s" issue we automatically minimize the seriousness of the problem and therefore the importance of it and
ultimately the attention men give the issues. The majority of our citizens are women. Yet, we continue to define
them as a “special interest group” or as a “minority group” not because of their numbers but because of their lack
of influence, resources and perceived lack of value.
We must all begin to use language that speaks to the issue of men perpetrating violence and that is accountable.
Rarely, if ever, do we refer to violence against women as an issue for men to confront. The lack of desire to name
the problem is not by coincidence. It is just one way that we protect men by placing the focus on women and on
their victimization, there by diverting attention away from the men who perpetrate the crimes. We all have learned
well to value and protect men while giving less value or concern for women. The use of our language and the way
we organize our thinking around issues concerning women is often presented in a way not to offend men or make
men uncomfortable. We label men’s violence against women with terms like gender violence, relationship abuse,
intimate partner violence and other similarly generic and neutral terms. The inaccurate naming of the problem
continues to remove responsibility and accountability from men. Even the term “domestic violence” does not
speak to the issue and places no responsibility on the offender.
Most offenses that men perpetrate against women that are illegal and arrestable go unreported and without any
form of consequence. The overwhelming majority of the men that do enter the criminal justice system do not
experience prosecution and the small percentages that are prosecuted receive little or no penalty. In operating the
largest batterers’ program in the country, it is clear that men who abuse, batter and assault share much more in
common with all men than they share differences. The belief systems and sense of entitlement are one in the same.
Both groups of men, those who are well meaning and those who perpetrate violence, have been socialized to
support the idea that they have rights that take precedence over the rights of woman and children.
2
The Socialization of Men: Specific beliefs, norms, and expectations are taught to men and boys, which assist
them in maintaining and reinforcing the control of their socially constructed and sanctioned male dominance. The
foundation that our traditional male socialization is built upon has three key elements of belief about women. The
first is the belief that women have less value or worth than men. The second is that women are to be considered as
property belonging to men. Finally, women are viewed as objects (to be objectified by men) which again
reinforces their status of having less value. We receive constant messages from every segment of our society that
reinforce and strengthen this foundation. Due to this belief system, when women are victims of violence, rape or
abuse, many men tend not to identify with the victim and do not experience any meaningful concern toward her
circumstance or situation. Moreover, most men consider themselves to be well intentioned and one of the “good
guys”. These men do not see themselves as men who would ever engage in violent or abusive behavior. In their
minds, they are exempt from fault and therefore have minimal concern about how other men behave toward
women.
However, most men often blame women for their victimization and excuse men for their abusive behaviors.
We tend to judge a woman before we believe a woman. We do this by showing support for men and skepticism
toward women. We often create a defense for men in our minds or with other men to excuse the abuser or rapists’
behavior. We too often seek to eliminate his fault while we blame her for his abuse. Men almost immediately
begin to examine what she wore, where she was and offer other excuses that have absolutely nothing to do with a
man’s choice to violate a woman.
Most tactics of control, abuse and oppression are not illegal. On a conscious and an unconscious level many men
engage in disrespectful, intimidating, and controlling behaviors. Most men who are abusive in these ways have not
broken any law and will never be a part of the criminal justice system; nor do they consider themselves to be
abusive. All men are not batterers, rapists, or abusive and many of us are not fully aware of the extent of our
privileges. However, all men do have the latitude to abuse power within their relationship and get away with it.
Due to the ever-present privilege that exists for men, the decision to abuse that power or to be egalitarian and
respectful is an individual decision and usually made on a daily basis. Yet, when forced to acknowledge abuse,
well meaning men consider other men who abuse and assault to be different from them and are quick to separate
themselves from the abuser. We look for ways to excuse or analyze the abusive man’s behavior. We attempt to
remove responsibility for his choices and actions by viewing his “outbursts” as pathological. We very often
excuse his violence and abuse by placing the blame on his anger. The assumption that a loss of control occurred is
incorrect. It is clear that he is fully capable of demonstrating restraint and control of his anger and his behavior
when he chooses. We too often seek to diagnose his abuse and attempt to provide treatment for his behavior.
There is no treatment because there is no sickness. As women have informed us “men’s violence against women is
a social ill, not an individual pathology, requiring social change not social work.”
Men Value Women Less: In our society we have a double standard concerning violence that men perpetrate
toward the women they are partnered with versus the violence that men perpetrate toward a stranger or nonintimate
partner. Men who break the law in both instances are hopefully arrested. If they are arrested they are
placed on two separate tracks within the criminal justice system and held to quite different standards of
accountability. Men who are violent toward their partner are given less of a penalty, consequence or sanction than
men who perpetrate the identical violence toward anyone else. Even men of color, when perpetrating crimes
against a female partner, experience leniency in the criminal justice system as a norm when compared to penalties
they receive associated with other crimes. Therefore, the moment a woman becomes identified as being the
intimate partner of a man, her value automatically decreases. Justice is no longer based on the crime that the man
committed, but rather whom the crime was committed against. This injustice should not be surprising. As a rule,
the social construct of sexism dictates that provisions, allowances and exceptions are to be made for men.
Consider if a person was anti-Semitic or acted out in a racist manner. What excuses would we come up with for
that behavior? What prescription or treatment would we offer to cure this prejudice? What term would our
3
therapists and clinicians find in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual to diagnose such hatred? These questions
sound ridiculous because we would not pathologize this behavior or belief; nor would we attempt to make excuses
for it. We would simply say stop it! It’s wrong and it is not acceptable! Everyone knows that such behavior breaks
the social contract and civilized folks don’t act that way. In addition, it would not matter if the anti-Semitic person
grew up in an anti-Semitic household or environment. It would not matter if the bigotry or racism were
“generational” or if the person was under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the offense. Individual
citizens and the entire community would fully understand that there is no excuse or reason for such behaviors.
Furthermore, the person of color or the Jewish person would not be blamed for the abusive act that was
perpetrated against them.
The Collusion of “Well Meaning” Men: I would like to believe that the majority of men are well meaning. It is
this group, however, that is responsible for supporting the epidemic of violence that the abusive men inflict upon
women. Men who choose to remain silent constantly reinforce the abusive man’s behavior. Our silence is also our
permission. While the intent of our silence may not be to cause harm, it does. The decision to not speak out is an
act of collusion and serves to preserve the privilege of men. The silence of men normalizes the abuser’s behavior
and this causes additional harm to women. We do this in many ways. Sometimes it is as simple as remaining silent
when a sexist joke is told or not challenging a friend who makes a statement that degrades women or is
threatening to women.
“Well-meaning” men consciously and subconsciously separate themselves from men who batter and abuse while
simultaneously giving them permission to do so. Well-meaning men consider themselves different from the
perpetrator because they have an imaginary line that they will not cross. This line represents the separation of
what are abusive behaviors from non-abusive behavior and who is a “good guy” from a “bad guy.” The wellmeaning
man, at times, will go right up against the line of inappropriate behavior. But, as long as he doesn’t cross
it (or get caught crossing it) he is still considered a “good guy”. Meanwhile, many of us have at least thought
about doing or saying things that are similar to what the abusive man says or does. When men do not speak out
about violence against women they are taking an active and/or passive role in affirming the violence. When we
remain by-standers we are making a choice to support the abuse. The abusive behavior by any man reflects and
therefore reinforces the established status and privileges of all men.
Recognizing Our Privilege and Entitlement: As men we are members of the dominating group. Because of this
membership, each individual man automatically receives the benefits available to the group as a whole. Even
those of us who may not want the benefits, privileges and entitlements that are given to men, as part of the
dominating group we have access to the benefits and privileges given to the entire group. In other words, men who
are well meaning, who choose to confront their sexism and their male privilege will continue to benefit from the
sexist construct that exist for their benefit and comfort. These advantages have been established and maintained
for their benefit and are outside of their control. Another example of this is the benefit of white privilege. White
people who are well meaning and choose to address their racism and their race privilege will continue to benefit
from the racist construct that exist and was established and maintained for their benefit and comfort. Even if and
when they do not want their race privilege or advantage to exist, it is still present.
Therefore, all men benefit from men’s violence against women. The well-meaning men and the perpetrator have a
silent partnership. The perpetrator is the enforcer of the rules that the well-meaning men have helped design, live
by, support and benefit from. In return, the well-meaning man does nothing and says nothing about the
objectification, the control or the abusive behavior. Our silence and our permission are synonymous.
How Men Can Become Part of The Solution: Violence against women is a problem that each man must own
and make a personal commitment to end. While some men are the perpetrators all men are the benefactors of the
conditions that allow violence against women. It will not end until we, as men, decide that it will. It begins with
our challenging our own sexism, privileges and beliefs. We must take ownership of the problem in order to create
4
positive social change. It will require honesty, sacrifice and transparency. In addition to examining our views
toward women (individually and collectively) we must also challenge our views and beliefs about each other. A
major obstacle will be to confront our traditional male socialization and how it limits us and boxes us in. We must
get out of the socially defined roles that sexism, patriarchy and male privilege provide for us. In addition, we must
end our collusion with the violence, objectification and demeaning thoughts and behaviors that we as men engage
in toward women. This will require that we address our fears and anxiety about stepping out of our defined roles
and challenge the traditional images of manhood. The fear of being perceived as “soft” or “weak” is an obstacle
for many men that stop them from challenging sexist attitudes and behaviors. Our conforming to traditional male
socialization prohibits us from confronting the abuse and objectification of women by other men. This belief
system negatively impacts men and women and the ways that we raise, educate, and socialize our boys and girls.
It is essential that men hold other men accountable for their violence. We must use our effort, resources and
influence within our communities to create appropriate and effective systems of accountability for men’s violence
and abuse toward women. Every community and social system that is a part of our society is influenced or run by
men. When we collectively decide to confront the issue of men’s violence against women in a serious and
meaningful way, we can end the terror and abuse.
Create Systems of Accountability to Women in Your Community: As men who are part of the solution to end
violence against women and sexism, our success is dependent on seeking the leadership of women and allowing
that leadership to guide us. We must be informed by the knowledge, experience and voice of the women who are
also dedicated to undoing sexism and ending all forms of violence against women. If we do not listen to, invest in
and believe the voice of women we are once again maintaining the imbalance of power and reinforcing our status
while we continue to marginalize women and their experience. After all, women are the experts on our violence
and abuse toward them. The dominating group cannot define the oppression for those who are oppressed.
The moment we as men decide to fully own our responsibility for violence against women we will be on the road
to social change. This will require integrity, accountability and consistency through action. Once we commit to
this way of life women will not need to worry about where they go, what they wear, or if they are safe. The day
when we, along with our sisters, have redefined manhood so that violence is not a part of being a man. We hope
for a time when we will be respected for the peace, honor and respect that we demonstrate.
Finally, women do not need to be rescued or saved by men. What is needed, however, is for men not to be abusive
or violent. When men end the abuse, safety will take care of itself.


Sincerely,
Rachel Kindred

After this email below, I was blocked, although they did get several of my emails.  I assume the following names are familiar to you, Mr. McMillan is the President of the NC Bar Association.

So far, I have not been able to secure representation, although I am trying to find John Edwards to speak with him about this.  As far as I'm concerned, this has been one gigantic cover-up.  Would you care to explain why the FBI has not taken any action?  Has the FBI launched an Internal Affairs Investigation as to why no action was taken a year and a half ago?  I am a citizen of the United States.  I reported a prima facie
violation of my Constitutional rights to every level of law enforcement of the state.  Noone made a determination of probable cause, let alone made arrests.  I believe that warrants a RICO investigation.   To say that I am irate would be the understatement of the 21st century.  Where do we stand?

Subject: RICO applied

A citizen reports a prima facie violation of her Constitutional rights to Lopez, Hodge, Council, 30 members of the command staff, the County Attorney Kitchen, the City Attorney Blinder, the FBI, the Bar via its agent, and Attorney General Cooper.  Did I miss anyone? Once even the possibility of a federal crime has been reported, RICO seems to make it clear that law enforcement possesses the duty to determine probable cause.  Refusal to determine probable cause if even the possibility of a federal violation has committed falls directly under the scope of RICO.  If two or more people discussed what do or not to do to accomplish an illegal objective, in this case a) violating a citizens first amendment right and b) refusing to determine probable cause then an overt act has taken place, then another crime of conspiracy exists.  Conspiracy is a separate crime and does not merge into the
underlying offense.  How is it that a citizen can report to every level of law enforcement in the state and have there be no action?  We know that is the way they do business in Zimbabwe, but in the United States?  I can't even wrap my mind around the monstrosity of that.

A city has the right to place time, place, and manner restrictions on a citizen's exercise of her first amendment right to free speech.  We just received an email from Patrick Baker that the City has never had the latter in place.  All anyone had to do was tell me that.  However, a police department acts unconstitutionally when it exercises UNFETTERED DISCRETION.  Refusing to advise a citizen of its permit and use of force procedures has no other purpose than to place that citizen in fear and is a prima facie violation of that citizen's 1st amendment rights.  Ron Evans told me when he was schmoozing me to pack up my picket sign and go home that "everyone knows you're crazy."  What kind of crazy am I, exactly?  Cherry Hill crazy?  Upon objective examination, you will find everyone thinks I'm crazy because I do not allow others to control me.  I do not trade sexual favors to gain influence or win city money.  When I get pushed around by
bullies, I fight back.  Even if I were crazy by some clinical standard, I note that crazy people are protected by the Constitution, too.   There was violence in the air around the back of the PD that week, and it was directed at me.  Could there be any other purpose to not informing me of permit procedures other than to show me who was boss?  Don't I have the right to know if I'm going to get beaten up if I'm protesting without a picket permit?  To make me scared?  To put me in my place?  To control me?  To pay me back?   I was so scared that I flashedback to when I was raped in my early 20's.  I was so scared you people made me cry.  Ron was right there, he walked me around the block.

 So let me tell you my intent.  I want an analysis of probable cause on the constititional violation, the civil rights conspiracy statute, and the RICO statute.  If probable cause is found against 50 people, then I want 50 people arrested.  I want them to be held without bond.  I want them to do jail time if found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  If probable cause is not found, there be better some airtight shit going on in that analsis cause I'm gonna pick it apart like I'm picking out fleas out of a hounddog's head.  And the city of Durham, the County, and the State need to come up with $10million each.  That is my civil settlement demand.  Ironically, no lawyer will return my call so this is still a DIY Constitutional revolution.  You people took oaths to defend the Constitution.  This is what defending the Constitution looks like.  Plus you made me scared and made me cry.  I will never stop.

Pay up.

Subject: Cover-up

Dear Governor Perdue:  A year and a half ago, I picketed at the back of the Durham PD.  The Durham PD and City Hall refused to advise me of picket permit requirements and use-of-force procedures.  That is a prima facie violation of my Constitutional rights. I picketed anyway and was scared to death. I believe the evidence will show that the command staff intended to put me in fear.  Lopez was well-briefed even before he came to Durham.   I reported to every level of law enforcement in the state: Lopez, Hodge, 30 members of the command staff, Sheriff Hill, County Attorney Kitchen, and Attorney General Roy Cooper to get help in getting permit and use-of-force proceudres.  In addition, I requested the help of several attorneys: Baker, Sindelair, Clement, Kitchen, and your Attorney general Cooper.  Noone did anything even as I exercised my right to speak in deathly fear at the back of the PD.    Mr. McMillan, President of the NC Bar is
in receipt of the details, as is the FBI and the people cc:d above.  I am getting stonewalled and stonewalled.  I made a very reasonable request below, and these people seem to be having an issue with dealing with me, contrary to public records law.  I am a JD but cannot find a lawyer. I am also being treated unfairly since I would love to have a lawyer but am unemployed, so I got to DIY.  I have requested an Internal Affairs investigation of the PD and the FBI and filed a complaint against several attorneys with the Bar, including your Attorney General Cooper.   I have requested a RICO investigation based on Obstruction of Justice and the civil rights conspiracy statute.  Madame Governor, the Duke Lacrosse legacy will never be over until Durham is cleaned up. How can you help?  Respectfully, Rachel Kindred, JD

Sincerely,
Rachel Kindred

I notice from the organizational charts on the DPD website that Captain Evans is no longer the District 5 commander as he was a year and a half ago nor is he the Executive Officer to Bev Council anymore...the only reference to him is on the obviously outdated contact list, he was taken off the organizational charts...was he forced to retire?  was he subjected to any disciplinary action?  was he subject to an internal affairs investigation?  was he directed down to manage me by Hodge?  Was he acting on orders?  From whom?   What orders was he acting on?   Was he interviewed?  Why are Internal Affairs complaints against regular officers public and complaints against the command staff not?   Why was I not given a status report of my complaints as is procedure stated by the Durham PD's own policies?  Did anyone from the City Council, city Attorney, or City Manager communicate with anyone at the PD about the complaints I raised?   Mr.
Bonfield, please tell me the procedures I need to follow (format) to get a complete documentary record.  Obviously, no lawsuit has been filed, so this entire matter is outside the scope of the litigation process, including claims of governmental immunity.  As far as I'm concerned, this is a criminal matter.  If the FBI will send me an email that these questions are being addressed and the documentary record being requested, then I will merely ask for a duplicate of everything that is turned over to them in that investigation....Mr. McMillan, what is the status of my complaints to the Bar about the attorneys in question:  Baker, Clement, Blinder, Sindelair, Kitchen, Cooper, the Police Attorneys?  FBI, has an Internal Affairs investigation been launched?  What's the delay?

ENDING MEN'S VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
By Ted Bunch
My most memorable experience of what a full sense of privilege probably feels like was when I first received myE-Z Pass for my car. E-Z Pass is a device that allows tolls to be automatically deducted from the driver’s accountso that cash is not needed and therefore you get processed through tolls much faster when traveling. As Iapproached the toll, the tollgate began to rise and I drove through with no delay. I looked back at the long line of
cars in the cash lane. I remember thinking as I watched the gate rise for me to pass that this must be what it is liketo be a white man in America. I had access and privileges that made me feel welcome and preferred.
My male privilege as a black man is different; it does not go everywhere I go. For instance, if the police stop mewhile I am driving my car, I instinctively know to keep my hands on the steering wheel at the 10:00 and 2:00 position. I don’t believe that the average white male experiences the police in the same way. This is because his
male privilege is directly connected to and cannot be separated from his race privilege. However, even men ofcolor, while being marginalized by racism, continue to experience the privileges and entitlements associated with
being male. The benefit of this privilege operates in virtually every household, from the oldest male member to
the youngest male child. Our privilege consists of rights, power and advantages given to men by men. Men control
these rights and monitor them often at the expense of women.
Naming The Problem: Domestic violence, rape, sexual assault and all forms of violence against women are the
manifestation of sexism. The violence and abuse by men toward women is rooted in our history, our laws and
woven into the fabric of our society. It must be contextualized within the construct of sexism, because male
privilege, patriarchy and misogyny support this violence. The privileges, entitlements and advantage that we as
men receive from the existing social and political construct provide us with support to act in overtly and covertly
demeaning, oppressive, controlling and abusive ways toward women. Our culture and norms are founded on the
belief that women have less value than men, and that the role of women is for the benefit, use, entertainment and
pleasure of men.
For many years, concerned citizens, activists, advocates and many other dedicated people have made great efforts
to end men’s violence against women. The anti-rape and sexual assault community as well as the domestic
violence community have been a tremendous change agent and have made remarkable progress in the effort to
create safety, justice and fairness for women. Unfortunately, despite years of great effort, sacrifice and loss of life,
the terror that women experience has not decreased. Men continue to get away with their violence, abuse,
intimidation as well as the misuse of power for the purpose of controlling and dominating women. This is no
reflection on those communities or any other effort for change. However, it is a reflection on men and the lack of
concern that we as men have for most issues affecting women. This is especially disturbing because the pain,
suffering, exploitation and immeasurable loss that women experience is almost always due to violence and abuse
at the hands of men.
Domestic violence, rape and sexual assault are the most devastating health issues and social problems facing our
society. There is no other problem, disease or illness that claims as many victims. In almost every case the
perpetrator is a male and the victim is a female. No other crime or social ill has such a destructive effect on
families, children, communities or the workplace than men’s violence against women. For this reason, if for no
other, it is vital that men become involved in the effort to end men’s violence against women. Each man
individually, and we as men collectively, must take a stand and own up to our responsibility to challenge other
men and end the violence that we allow to be perpetrated against women in our communities.
1
The American Medical Association estimates that almost 4 million men severely assault their intimate female
partner or spouse each year. Men’s violence against their intimate female partner is the leading cause of injury for
women, and is the cause of at least 35% of all emergency room visits. Every day approximately 4 men kill their
present or former intimate female partner. As many as 75% of those men murder the women they were partnered
with during or after a separation. It is estimated that 25% of men batter during a woman’s pregnancy. The U.S.
Department of Justice reports that men will rape 1 out of 6 women and commit more than 300,000 acts of rape
and sexual assault every year. It is estimated that 84% of rape and sexual assault goes unreported. In addition,
more than 80% of those women and girls will be under the age of 25. It is a fact that more than 3 out of 4 rapists
will know the women they rape. In fact there is not a moment or second during any day that men are not violating,
assaulting or exploiting women. Men are responsible for a multi-billion dollar industry that supports and promotes
the commercial sexual exploitation, enslavement and trafficking of women. There is no time that women are safe
or free from fear.
If we as men choose not to become involved in ending our violence against women it is because we choose to
remain invested in maintaining our privilege and advantage. Our privileges and entitlements can only come at the
expense of women. Any violence, abuse or degradation committed toward a woman by a man supports the status
of men as the dominating group while also reinforcing the oppression of women. There is no neutral position or
stance for men to take. We can either choose to become part of the solution or remain part of the problem.
The Use of Accountable Language: Violence against women is a violation of human rights. If any group were to
attack another group of people who are law abiding, peaceful, loving and productive members of a society, the
group that was the aggressor would be brought up on human rights violations. Here in the United States men,
women and children are socialized to protect the status of men. We protect men in our language and our
terminology. We almost always frame the issue of domestic violence and violence against women as a “women’s
issue”. By categorizing domestic violence, rape, sexual assault and other forms of violence against women as a
"women’s" issue we automatically minimize the seriousness of the problem and therefore the importance of it and
ultimately the attention men give the issues. The majority of our citizens are women. Yet, we continue to define
them as a “special interest group” or as a “minority group” not because of their numbers but because of their lack
of influence, resources and perceived lack of value.
We must all begin to use language that speaks to the issue of men perpetrating violence and that is accountable.
Rarely, if ever, do we refer to violence against women as an issue for men to confront. The lack of desire to name
the problem is not by coincidence. It is just one way that we protect men by placing the focus on women and on
their victimization, there by diverting attention away from the men who perpetrate the crimes. We all have learned
well to value and protect men while giving less value or concern for women. The use of our language and the way
we organize our thinking around issues concerning women is often presented in a way not to offend men or make
men uncomfortable. We label men’s violence against women with terms like gender violence, relationship abuse,
intimate partner violence and other similarly generic and neutral terms. The inaccurate naming of the problem
continues to remove responsibility and accountability from men. Even the term “domestic violence” does not
speak to the issue and places no responsibility on the offender.
Most offenses that men perpetrate against women that are illegal and arrestable go unreported and without any
form of consequence. The overwhelming majority of the men that do enter the criminal justice system do not
experience prosecution and the small percentages that are prosecuted receive little or no penalty. In operating the
largest batterers’ program in the country, it is clear that men who abuse, batter and assault share much more in
common with all men than they share differences. The belief systems and sense of entitlement are one in the same.
Both groups of men, those who are well meaning and those who perpetrate violence, have been socialized to
support the idea that they have rights that take precedence over the rights of woman and children.
2
The Socialization of Men: Specific beliefs, norms, and expectations are taught to men and boys, which assist
them in maintaining and reinforcing the control of their socially constructed and sanctioned male dominance. The
foundation that our traditional male socialization is built upon has three key elements of belief about women. The
first is the belief that women have less value or worth than men. The second is that women are to be considered as
property belonging to men. Finally, women are viewed as objects (to be objectified by men) which again
reinforces their status of having less value. We receive constant messages from every segment of our society that
reinforce and strengthen this foundation. Due to this belief system, when women are victims of violence, rape or
abuse, many men tend not to identify with the victim and do not experience any meaningful concern toward her
circumstance or situation. Moreover, most men consider themselves to be well intentioned and one of the “good
guys”. These men do not see themselves as men who would ever engage in violent or abusive behavior. In their
minds, they are exempt from fault and therefore have minimal concern about how other men behave toward
women.
However, most men often blame women for their victimization and excuse men for their abusive behaviors.
We tend to judge a woman before we believe a woman. We do this by showing support for men and skepticism
toward women. We often create a defense for men in our minds or with other men to excuse the abuser or rapists’
behavior. We too often seek to eliminate his fault while we blame her for his abuse. Men almost immediately
begin to examine what she wore, where she was and offer other excuses that have absolutely nothing to do with a
man’s choice to violate a woman.
Most tactics of control, abuse and oppression are not illegal. On a conscious and an unconscious level many men
engage in disrespectful, intimidating, and controlling behaviors. Most men who are abusive in these ways have not
broken any law and will never be a part of the criminal justice system; nor do they consider themselves to be
abusive. All men are not batterers, rapists, or abusive and many of us are not fully aware of the extent of our
privileges. However, all men do have the latitude to abuse power within their relationship and get away with it.
Due to the ever-present privilege that exists for men, the decision to abuse that power or to be egalitarian and
respectful is an individual decision and usually made on a daily basis. Yet, when forced to acknowledge abuse,
well meaning men consider other men who abuse and assault to be different from them and are quick to separate
themselves from the abuser. We look for ways to excuse or analyze the abusive man’s behavior. We attempt to
remove responsibility for his choices and actions by viewing his “outbursts” as pathological. We very often
excuse his violence and abuse by placing the blame on his anger. The assumption that a loss of control occurred is
incorrect. It is clear that he is fully capable of demonstrating restraint and control of his anger and his behavior
when he chooses. We too often seek to diagnose his abuse and attempt to provide treatment for his behavior.
There is no treatment because there is no sickness. As women have informed us “men’s violence against women is
a social ill, not an individual pathology, requiring social change not social work.”
Men Value Women Less: In our society we have a double standard concerning violence that men perpetrate
toward the women they are partnered with versus the violence that men perpetrate toward a stranger or nonintimate
partner. Men who break the law in both instances are hopefully arrested. If they are arrested they are
placed on two separate tracks within the criminal justice system and held to quite different standards of
accountability. Men who are violent toward their partner are given less of a penalty, consequence or sanction than
men who perpetrate the identical violence toward anyone else. Even men of color, when perpetrating crimes
against a female partner, experience leniency in the criminal justice system as a norm when compared to penalties
they receive associated with other crimes. Therefore, the moment a woman becomes identified as being the
intimate partner of a man, her value automatically decreases. Justice is no longer based on the crime that the man
committed, but rather whom the crime was committed against. This injustice should not be surprising. As a rule,
the social construct of sexism dictates that provisions, allowances and exceptions are to be made for men.
Consider if a person was anti-Semitic or acted out in a racist manner. What excuses would we come up with for
that behavior? What prescription or treatment would we offer to cure this prejudice? What term would our
3
therapists and clinicians find in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual to diagnose such hatred? These questions
sound ridiculous because we would not pathologize this behavior or belief; nor would we attempt to make excuses
for it. We would simply say stop it! It’s wrong and it is not acceptable! Everyone knows that such behavior breaks
the social contract and civilized folks don’t act that way. In addition, it would not matter if the anti-Semitic person
grew up in an anti-Semitic household or environment. It would not matter if the bigotry or racism were
“generational” or if the person was under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the offense. Individual
citizens and the entire community would fully understand that there is no excuse or reason for such behaviors.
Furthermore, the person of color or the Jewish person would not be blamed for the abusive act that was
perpetrated against them.
The Collusion of “Well Meaning” Men: I would like to believe that the majority of men are well meaning. It is
this group, however, that is responsible for supporting the epidemic of violence that the abusive men inflict upon
women. Men who choose to remain silent constantly reinforce the abusive man’s behavior. Our silence is also our
permission. While the intent of our silence may not be to cause harm, it does. The decision to not speak out is an
act of collusion and serves to preserve the privilege of men. The silence of men normalizes the abuser’s behavior
and this causes additional harm to women. We do this in many ways. Sometimes it is as simple as remaining silent
when a sexist joke is told or not challenging a friend who makes a statement that degrades women or is
threatening to women.
“Well-meaning” men consciously and subconsciously separate themselves from men who batter and abuse while
simultaneously giving them permission to do so. Well-meaning men consider themselves different from the
perpetrator because they have an imaginary line that they will not cross. This line represents the separation of
what are abusive behaviors from non-abusive behavior and who is a “good guy” from a “bad guy.” The wellmeaning
man, at times, will go right up against the line of inappropriate behavior. But, as long as he doesn’t cross
it (or get caught crossing it) he is still considered a “good guy”. Meanwhile, many of us have at least thought
about doing or saying things that are similar to what the abusive man says or does. When men do not speak out
about violence against women they are taking an active and/or passive role in affirming the violence. When we
remain by-standers we are making a choice to support the abuse. The abusive behavior by any man reflects and
therefore reinforces the established status and privileges of all men.
Recognizing Our Privilege and Entitlement: As men we are members of the dominating group. Because of this
membership, each individual man automatically receives the benefits available to the group as a whole. Even
those of us who may not want the benefits, privileges and entitlements that are given to men, as part of the
dominating group we have access to the benefits and privileges given to the entire group. In other words, men who
are well meaning, who choose to confront their sexism and their male privilege will continue to benefit from the
sexist construct that exist for their benefit and comfort. These advantages have been established and maintained
for their benefit and are outside of their control. Another example of this is the benefit of white privilege. White
people who are well meaning and choose to address their racism and their race privilege will continue to benefit
from the racist construct that exist and was established and maintained for their benefit and comfort. Even if and
when they do not want their race privilege or advantage to exist, it is still present.
Therefore, all men benefit from men’s violence against women. The well-meaning men and the perpetrator have a
silent partnership. The perpetrator is the enforcer of the rules that the well-meaning men have helped design, live
by, support and benefit from. In return, the well-meaning man does nothing and says nothing about the
objectification, the control or the abusive behavior. Our silence and our permission are synonymous.
How Men Can Become Part of The Solution: Violence against women is a problem that each man must own
and make a personal commitment to end. While some men are the perpetrators all men are the benefactors of the
conditions that allow violence against women. It will not end until we, as men, decide that it will. It begins with
our challenging our own sexism, privileges and beliefs. We must take ownership of the problem in order to create
4
positive social change. It will require honesty, sacrifice and transparency. In addition to examining our views
toward women (individually and collectively) we must also challenge our views and beliefs about each other. A
major obstacle will be to confront our traditional male socialization and how it limits us and boxes us in. We must
get out of the socially defined roles that sexism, patriarchy and male privilege provide for us. In addition, we must
end our collusion with the violence, objectification and demeaning thoughts and behaviors that we as men engage
in toward women. This will require that we address our fears and anxiety about stepping out of our defined roles
and challenge the traditional images of manhood. The fear of being perceived as “soft” or “weak” is an obstacle
for many men that stop them from challenging sexist attitudes and behaviors. Our conforming to traditional male
socialization prohibits us from confronting the abuse and objectification of women by other men. This belief
system negatively impacts men and women and the ways that we raise, educate, and socialize our boys and girls.
It is essential that men hold other men accountable for their violence. We must use our effort, resources and
influence within our communities to create appropriate and effective systems of accountability for men’s violence
and abuse toward women. Every community and social system that is a part of our society is influenced or run by
men. When we collectively decide to confront the issue of men’s violence against women in a serious and
meaningful way, we can end the terror and abuse.
Create Systems of Accountability to Women in Your Community: As men who are part of the solution to end
violence against women and sexism, our success is dependent on seeking the leadership of women and allowing
that leadership to guide us. We must be informed by the knowledge, experience and voice of the women who are
also dedicated to undoing sexism and ending all forms of violence against women. If we do not listen to, invest in
and believe the voice of women we are once again maintaining the imbalance of power and reinforcing our status
while we continue to marginalize women and their experience. After all, women are the experts on our violence
and abuse toward them. The dominating group cannot define the oppression for those who are oppressed.
The moment we as men decide to fully own our responsibility for violence against women we will be on the road
to social change. This will require integrity, accountability and consistency through action. Once we commit to
this way of life women will not need to worry about where they go, what they wear, or if they are safe. The day
when we, along with our sisters, have redefined manhood so that violence is not a part of being a man. We hope
for a time when we will be respected for the peace, honor and respect that we demonstrate.
Finally, women do not need to be rescued or saved by men. What is needed, however, is for men not to be abusive
or violent. When men end the abuse, safety will take care of itself.


Sincerely,
Rachel Kindred

So far, I have not been able to secure representation, although I am trying to find John Edwards to speak with him about this.  As far as I'm concerned, this has been one gigantic cover-up.  Would you care to explain why the FBI has not taken any action?  Has the FBI launched an Internal Affairs Investigation as to why no action was taken a year and a half ago?  I am a citizen of the United States.  I reported a prima facie
violation of my Constitutional rights to every level of law enforcement of the state.  Noone made a determination of probable cause, let alone made arrests.  I believe that warrants a RICO investigation.   To say that I am irate would be the understatement of the 21st century.  Where do we stand?

Subject: RICO applied

A citizen reports a prima facie violation of her Constitutional rights to Lopez, Hodge, Council, 30 members of the command staff, the County Attorney Kitchen, the City Attorney Blinder, the FBI, the Bar via its agent, and Attorney General Cooper.  Did I miss anyone? Once even the possibility of a federal crime has been reported, RICO seems to make it clear that law enforcement possesses the duty to determine probable cause.  Refusal to determine probable cause if even the possibility of a federal violation has committed falls directly under the scope of RICO.  If two or more people discussed what do or not to do to accomplish an illegal objective, in this case a) violating a citizens first amendment right and b) refusing to determine probable cause then an overt act has taken place, then another crime of conspiracy exists.  Conspiracy is a separate crime and does not merge into the
underlying offense.  How is it that a citizen can report to every level of law enforcement in the state and have there be no action?  We know that is the way they do business in Zimbabwe, but in the United States?  I can't even wrap my mind around the monstrosity of that.

A city has the right to place time, place, and manner restrictions on a citizen's exercise of her first amendment right to free speech.  We just received an email from Patrick Baker that the City has never had the latter in place.  All anyone had to do was tell me that.  However, a police department acts unconstitutionally when it exercises UNFETTERED DISCRETION.  Refusing to advise a citizen of its permit and use of force procedures has no other purpose than to place that citizen in fear and is a prima facie violation of that citizen's 1st amendment rights.  Ron Evans told me when he was schmoozing me to pack up my picket sign and go home that "everyone knows you're crazy."  What kind of crazy am I, exactly?  Cherry Hill crazy?  Upon objective examination, you will find everyone thinks I'm crazy because I do not allow others to control me.  I do not trade sexual favors to gain influence or win city money.  When I get pushed around by
bullies, I fight back.  Even if I were crazy by some clinical standard, I note that crazy people are protected by the Constitution, too.   There was violence in the air around the back of the PD that week, and it was directed at me.  Could there be any other purpose to not informing me of permit procedures other than to show me who was boss?  Don't I have the right to know if I'm going to get beaten up if I'm protesting without a picket permit?  To make me scared?  To put me in my place?  To control me?  To pay me back?   I was so scared that I flashedback to when I was raped in my early 20's.  I was so scared you people made me cry.  Ron was right there, he walked me around the block.

 So let me tell you my intent.  I want an analysis of probable cause on the constititional violation, the civil rights conspiracy statute, and the RICO statute.  If probable cause is found against 50 people, then I want 50 people arrested.  I want them to be held without bond.  I want them to do jail time if found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  If probable cause is not found, there be better some airtight shit going on in that analsis cause I'm gonna pick it apart like I'm picking out fleas out of a hounddog's head.  And the city of Durham, the County, and the State need to come up with $10million each.  That is my civil settlement demand.  Ironically, no lawyer will return my call so this is still a DIY Constitutional revolution.  You people took oaths to defend the Constitution.  This is what defending the Constitution looks like.  Plus you made me scared and made me cry.  I will never stop.

Pay up.

Sincerely,
Rachel Kindred

Last week, this blurb was on the front page of the atty general's website, now it has been moved to FAQ.  Why?  And BTW this falls under the category of "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"  First, I note that the Atty general got well and truly involved in the Duke Lacrosse case, and so this standard does not, obviously, apply to the rich and powerful.  Second, you can see from my efforts how this hands-off policy applies to the real world.  I am uniquely stubborn--do you think anybody else would be stupid enough to pay the cost of what this quest for justice is costing me?  Ha, Ha. Governor, you can change this political policy with one Executive Order.  Set up a hotline so citizens can report government corruption in City Hall, police departments, District Attorneys, and Sheriffs department to someone who gives a crap. CrimeStoppers would be a great model.   Maybe an ADA or a cop would have called during the Duke Lacrosse case.  That is the obvious
 lesson learned from Mike Nifong, and y'all didn't do it.  Why?  What vested interest do you have in protecting city and county officials who violate the Constitution against economically helpless American citizens?  It would be interesting to find out how many complaints has your Atty General received and covered-up about city and county governments, PD, and Sheriffs offices...How many, Mr. Cooper? I have a public records/FOI request outstanding...y'all don't even follow the law yourselves.  Gag on y'all.

Complaints About Local Officials
District Attorneys:
In North Carolina, district attorneys are Constitutional officers directly elected by the people in the district where they serve and are not a part of the Attorney General's Office. Complaints against a member of a local district attorney's office should be directed to the staff member's immediate supervisor and, if unresolved, to the district attorney.
Local Police:
Local police departments are not supervised by the NC Department of Justice. Complaints against a member of a police department should be directed to the officer's immediate supervisor and, if unresolved, to the Chief of Police. The Chief of Police usually reports to a city or town manager (police commissioner in some small towns) who ultimately reports to the Mayor and the City/Town Council.
Local Sheriffs:
In North Carolina, Sheriffs are Constitutional officers directly elected by the people in county where they serve. Sheriffs' Offices are not supervised by the NC Department of Justice. Complaints against a member of a Sheriff's Office should be directed to the officer's immediate supervisor and, if unresolved, to the Sheriff.

Dear Governor Perdue:  A year and a half ago, I picketed at the back of the Durham PD.  The Durham PD and City Hall refused to advise me of picket permit requirements and use-of-force procedures.  That is a prima facie violation of my Constitutional rights. I picketed anyway and was scared to death. I believe the evidence will show that the command staff intended to put me in fear.  Lopez was well-briefed even before he came to Durham.   I reported to every level of law enforcement in the state: Lopez, Hodge, 30 members of the command staff, Sheriff Hill, County Attorney Kitchen, and Attorney General Roy Cooper to get help in getting permit and use-of-force proceudres.  In addition, I requested the help of several attorneys: Baker, Sindelair, Clement, Kitchen, and your Attorney general Cooper.  Noone did anything even as I exercised my right to speak in deathly fear at the back of the PD.    Mr. McMillan, President of the NC Bar is
in receipt of the details, as is the FBI and the people cc:d above.  I am getting stonewalled and stonewalled.  I made a very reasonable request below, and these people seem to be having an issue with dealing with me, contrary to public records law.  I am a JD but cannot find a lawyer. I am also being treated unfairly since I would love to have a lawyer but am unemployed, so I got to DIY.  I have requested an Internal Affairs investigation of the PD and the FBI and filed a complaint against several attorneys with the Bar, including your Attorney General Cooper.   I have requested a RICO investigation based on Obstruction of Justice and the civil rights conspiracy statute.  Madame Governor, the Duke Lacrosse legacy will never be over until Durham is cleaned up. How can you help?  Respectfully, Rachel Kindred, JD

I notice from the organizational charts on the DPD website that Captain Evans is no longer the District 5 commander as he was a year and a half ago nor is he the Executive Officer to Bev Council anymore...the only reference to him is on the obviously outdated contact list, he was taken off the organizational charts...was he forced to retire?  was he subjected to any disciplinary action?  was he subject to an internal affairs investigation?  was he directed down to manage me by Hodge?  Was he acting on orders?  From whom?   What orders was he acting on?   Was he interviewed?  Why are Internal Affairs complaints against regular officers public and complaints against the command staff not?   Why was I not given a status report of my complaints as is procedure stated by the Durham PD's own policies?  Did anyone from the City Council, city Attorney, or City Manager communicate with anyone at the PD about the complaints I raised?   Mr.
Bonfield, please tell me the procedures I need to follow (format) to get a complete documentary record.  Obviously, no lawsuit has been filed, so this entire matter is outside the scope of the litigation process, including claims of governmental immunity.  As far as I'm concerned, this is a criminal matter.  If the FBI will send me an email that these questions are being addressed and the documentary record being requested, then I will merely ask for a duplicate of everything that is turned over to them in that investigation....Mr. McMillan, what is the status of my complaints to the Bar about the attorneys in question:  Baker, Clement, Blinder, Sindelair, Kitchen, Cooper, the Police Attorneys?  FBI, has an Internal Affairs investigation been launched?  What's the delay?

ENDING MEN'S VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
By Ted Bunch
My most memorable experience of what a full sense of privilege probably feels like was when I first received myE-Z Pass for my car. E-Z Pass is a device that allows tolls to be automatically deducted from the driver’s accountso that cash is not needed and therefore you get processed through tolls much faster when traveling. As Iapproached the toll, the tollgate began to rise and I drove through with no delay. I looked back at the long line of
cars in the cash lane. I remember thinking as I watched the gate rise for me to pass that this must be what it is liketo be a white man in America. I had access and privileges that made me feel welcome and preferred.
My male privilege as a black man is different; it does not go everywhere I go. For instance, if the police stop mewhile I am driving my car, I instinctively know to keep my hands on the steering wheel at the 10:00 and 2:00 position. I don’t believe that the average white male experiences the police in the same way. This is because his
male privilege is directly connected to and cannot be separated from his race privilege. However, even men ofcolor, while being marginalized by racism, continue to experience the privileges and entitlements associated with
being male. The benefit of this privilege operates in virtually every household, from the oldest male member to
the youngest male child. Our privilege consists of rights, power and advantages given to men by men. Men control
these rights and monitor them often at the expense of women.
Naming The Problem: Domestic violence, rape, sexual assault and all forms of violence against women are the
manifestation of sexism. The violence and abuse by men toward women is rooted in our history, our laws and
woven into the fabric of our society. It must be contextualized within the construct of sexism, because male
privilege, patriarchy and misogyny support this violence. The privileges, entitlements and advantage that we as
men receive from the existing social and political construct provide us with support to act in overtly and covertly
demeaning, oppressive, controlling and abusive ways toward women. Our culture and norms are founded on the
belief that women have less value than men, and that the role of women is for the benefit, use, entertainment and
pleasure of men.
For many years, concerned citizens, activists, advocates and many other dedicated people have made great efforts
to end men’s violence against women. The anti-rape and sexual assault community as well as the domestic
violence community have been a tremendous change agent and have made remarkable progress in the effort to
create safety, justice and fairness for women. Unfortunately, despite years of great effort, sacrifice and loss of life,
the terror that women experience has not decreased. Men continue to get away with their violence, abuse,
intimidation as well as the misuse of power for the purpose of controlling and dominating women. This is no
reflection on those communities or any other effort for change. However, it is a reflection on men and the lack of
concern that we as men have for most issues affecting women. This is especially disturbing because the pain,
suffering, exploitation and immeasurable loss that women experience is almost always due to violence and abuse
at the hands of men.
Domestic violence, rape and sexual assault are the most devastating health issues and social problems facing our
society. There is no other problem, disease or illness that claims as many victims. In almost every case the
perpetrator is a male and the victim is a female. No other crime or social ill has such a destructive effect on
families, children, communities or the workplace than men’s violence against women. For this reason, if for no
other, it is vital that men become involved in the effort to end men’s violence against women. Each man
individually, and we as men collectively, must take a stand and own up to our responsibility to challenge other
men and end the violence that we allow to be perpetrated against women in our communities.
1
The American Medical Association estimates that almost 4 million men severely assault their intimate female
partner or spouse each year. Men’s violence against their intimate female partner is the leading cause of injury for
women, and is the cause of at least 35% of all emergency room visits. Every day approximately 4 men kill their
present or former intimate female partner. As many as 75% of those men murder the women they were partnered
with during or after a separation. It is estimated that 25% of men batter during a woman’s pregnancy. The U.S.
Department of Justice reports that men will rape 1 out of 6 women and commit more than 300,000 acts of rape
and sexual assault every year. It is estimated that 84% of rape and sexual assault goes unreported. In addition,
more than 80% of those women and girls will be under the age of 25. It is a fact that more than 3 out of 4 rapists
will know the women they rape. In fact there is not a moment or second during any day that men are not violating,
assaulting or exploiting women. Men are responsible for a multi-billion dollar industry that supports and promotes
the commercial sexual exploitation, enslavement and trafficking of women. There is no time that women are safe
or free from fear.
If we as men choose not to become involved in ending our violence against women it is because we choose to
remain invested in maintaining our privilege and advantage. Our privileges and entitlements can only come at the
expense of women. Any violence, abuse or degradation committed toward a woman by a man supports the status
of men as the dominating group while also reinforcing the oppression of women. There is no neutral position or
stance for men to take. We can either choose to become part of the solution or remain part of the problem.
The Use of Accountable Language: Violence against women is a violation of human rights. If any group were to
attack another group of people who are law abiding, peaceful, loving and productive members of a society, the
group that was the aggressor would be brought up on human rights violations. Here in the United States men,
women and children are socialized to protect the status of men. We protect men in our language and our
terminology. We almost always frame the issue of domestic violence and violence against women as a “women’s
issue”. By categorizing domestic violence, rape, sexual assault and other forms of violence against women as a
"women’s" issue we automatically minimize the seriousness of the problem and therefore the importance of it and
ultimately the attention men give the issues. The majority of our citizens are women. Yet, we continue to define
them as a “special interest group” or as a “minority group” not because of their numbers but because of their lack
of influence, resources and perceived lack of value.
We must all begin to use language that speaks to the issue of men perpetrating violence and that is accountable.
Rarely, if ever, do we refer to violence against women as an issue for men to confront. The lack of desire to name
the problem is not by coincidence. It is just one way that we protect men by placing the focus on women and on
their victimization, there by diverting attention away from the men who perpetrate the crimes. We all have learned
well to value and protect men while giving less value or concern for women. The use of our language and the way
we organize our thinking around issues concerning women is often presented in a way not to offend men or make
men uncomfortable. We label men’s violence against women with terms like gender violence, relationship abuse,
intimate partner violence and other similarly generic and neutral terms. The inaccurate naming of the problem
continues to remove responsibility and accountability from men. Even the term “domestic violence” does not
speak to the issue and places no responsibility on the offender.
Most offenses that men perpetrate against women that are illegal and arrestable go unreported and without any
form of consequence. The overwhelming majority of the men that do enter the criminal justice system do not
experience prosecution and the small percentages that are prosecuted receive little or no penalty. In operating the
largest batterers’ program in the country, it is clear that men who abuse, batter and assault share much more in
common with all men than they share differences. The belief systems and sense of entitlement are one in the same.
Both groups of men, those who are well meaning and those who perpetrate violence, have been socialized to
support the idea that they have rights that take precedence over the rights of woman and children.
2
The Socialization of Men: Specific beliefs, norms, and expectations are taught to men and boys, which assist
them in maintaining and reinforcing the control of their socially constructed and sanctioned male dominance. The
foundation that our traditional male socialization is built upon has three key elements of belief about women. The
first is the belief that women have less value or worth than men. The second is that women are to be considered as
property belonging to men. Finally, women are viewed as objects (to be objectified by men) which again
reinforces their status of having less value. We receive constant messages from every segment of our society that
reinforce and strengthen this foundation. Due to this belief system, when women are victims of violence, rape or
abuse, many men tend not to identify with the victim and do not experience any meaningful concern toward her
circumstance or situation. Moreover, most men consider themselves to be well intentioned and one of the “good
guys”. These men do not see themselves as men who would ever engage in violent or abusive behavior. In their
minds, they are exempt from fault and therefore have minimal concern about how other men behave toward
women.
However, most men often blame women for their victimization and excuse men for their abusive behaviors.
We tend to judge a woman before we believe a woman. We do this by showing support for men and skepticism
toward women. We often create a defense for men in our minds or with other men to excuse the abuser or rapists’
behavior. We too often seek to eliminate his fault while we blame her for his abuse. Men almost immediately
begin to examine what she wore, where she was and offer other excuses that have absolutely nothing to do with a
man’s choice to violate a woman.
Most tactics of control, abuse and oppression are not illegal. On a conscious and an unconscious level many men
engage in disrespectful, intimidating, and controlling behaviors. Most men who are abusive in these ways have not
broken any law and will never be a part of the criminal justice system; nor do they consider themselves to be
abusive. All men are not batterers, rapists, or abusive and many of us are not fully aware of the extent of our
privileges. However, all men do have the latitude to abuse power within their relationship and get away with it.
Due to the ever-present privilege that exists for men, the decision to abuse that power or to be egalitarian and
respectful is an individual decision and usually made on a daily basis. Yet, when forced to acknowledge abuse,
well meaning men consider other men who abuse and assault to be different from them and are quick to separate
themselves from the abuser. We look for ways to excuse or analyze the abusive man’s behavior. We attempt to
remove responsibility for his choices and actions by viewing his “outbursts” as pathological. We very often
excuse his violence and abuse by placing the blame on his anger. The assumption that a loss of control occurred is
incorrect. It is clear that he is fully capable of demonstrating restraint and control of his anger and his behavior
when he chooses. We too often seek to diagnose his abuse and attempt to provide treatment for his behavior.
There is no treatment because there is no sickness. As women have informed us “men’s violence against women is
a social ill, not an individual pathology, requiring social change not social work.”
Men Value Women Less: In our society we have a double standard concerning violence that men perpetrate
toward the women they are partnered with versus the violence that men perpetrate toward a stranger or nonintimate
partner. Men who break the law in both instances are hopefully arrested. If they are arrested they are
placed on two separate tracks within the criminal justice system and held to quite different standards of
accountability. Men who are violent toward their partner are given less of a penalty, consequence or sanction than
men who perpetrate the identical violence toward anyone else. Even men of color, when perpetrating crimes
against a female partner, experience leniency in the criminal justice system as a norm when compared to penalties
they receive associated with other crimes. Therefore, the moment a woman becomes identified as being the
intimate partner of a man, her value automatically decreases. Justice is no longer based on the crime that the man
committed, but rather whom the crime was committed against. This injustice should not be surprising. As a rule,
the social construct of sexism dictates that provisions, allowances and exceptions are to be made for men.
Consider if a person was anti-Semitic or acted out in a racist manner. What excuses would we come up with for
that behavior? What prescription or treatment would we offer to cure this prejudice? What term would our
3
therapists and clinicians find in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual to diagnose such hatred? These questions
sound ridiculous because we would not pathologize this behavior or belief; nor would we attempt to make excuses
for it. We would simply say stop it! It’s wrong and it is not acceptable! Everyone knows that such behavior breaks
the social contract and civilized folks don’t act that way. In addition, it would not matter if the anti-Semitic person
grew up in an anti-Semitic household or environment. It would not matter if the bigotry or racism were
“generational” or if the person was under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the offense. Individual
citizens and the entire community would fully understand that there is no excuse or reason for such behaviors.
Furthermore, the person of color or the Jewish person would not be blamed for the abusive act that was
perpetrated against them.
The Collusion of “Well Meaning” Men: I would like to believe that the majority of men are well meaning. It is
this group, however, that is responsible for supporting the epidemic of violence that the abusive men inflict upon
women. Men who choose to remain silent constantly reinforce the abusive man’s behavior. Our silence is also our
permission. While the intent of our silence may not be to cause harm, it does. The decision to not speak out is an
act of collusion and serves to preserve the privilege of men. The silence of men normalizes the abuser’s behavior
and this causes additional harm to women. We do this in many ways. Sometimes it is as simple as remaining silent
when a sexist joke is told or not challenging a friend who makes a statement that degrades women or is
threatening to women.
“Well-meaning” men consciously and subconsciously separate themselves from men who batter and abuse while
simultaneously giving them permission to do so. Well-meaning men consider themselves different from the
perpetrator because they have an imaginary line that they will not cross. This line represents the separation of
what are abusive behaviors from non-abusive behavior and who is a “good guy” from a “bad guy.” The wellmeaning
man, at times, will go right up against the line of inappropriate behavior. But, as long as he doesn’t cross
it (or get caught crossing it) he is still considered a “good guy”. Meanwhile, many of us have at least thought
about doing or saying things that are similar to what the abusive man says or does. When men do not speak out
about violence against women they are taking an active and/or passive role in affirming the violence. When we
remain by-standers we are making a choice to support the abuse. The abusive behavior by any man reflects and
therefore reinforces the established status and privileges of all men.
Recognizing Our Privilege and Entitlement: As men we are members of the dominating group. Because of this
membership, each individual man automatically receives the benefits available to the group as a whole. Even
those of us who may not want the benefits, privileges and entitlements that are given to men, as part of the
dominating group we have access to the benefits and privileges given to the entire group. In other words, men who
are well meaning, who choose to confront their sexism and their male privilege will continue to benefit from the
sexist construct that exist for their benefit and comfort. These advantages have been established and maintained
for their benefit and are outside of their control. Another example of this is the benefit of white privilege. White
people who are well meaning and choose to address their racism and their race privilege will continue to benefit
from the racist construct that exist and was established and maintained for their benefit and comfort. Even if and
when they do not want their race privilege or advantage to exist, it is still present.
Therefore, all men benefit from men’s violence against women. The well-meaning men and the perpetrator have a
silent partnership. The perpetrator is the enforcer of the rules that the well-meaning men have helped design, live
by, support and benefit from. In return, the well-meaning man does nothing and says nothing about the
objectification, the control or the abusive behavior. Our silence and our permission are synonymous.
How Men Can Become Part of The Solution: Violence against women is a problem that each man must own
and make a personal commitment to end. While some men are the perpetrators all men are the benefactors of the
conditions that allow violence against women. It will not end until we, as men, decide that it will. It begins with
our challenging our own sexism, privileges and beliefs. We must take ownership of the problem in order to create
4
positive social change. It will require honesty, sacrifice and transparency. In addition to examining our views
toward women (individually and collectively) we must also challenge our views and beliefs about each other. A
major obstacle will be to confront our traditional male socialization and how it limits us and boxes us in. We must
get out of the socially defined roles that sexism, patriarchy and male privilege provide for us. In addition, we must
end our collusion with the violence, objectification and demeaning thoughts and behaviors that we as men engage
in toward women. This will require that we address our fears and anxiety about stepping out of our defined roles
and challenge the traditional images of manhood. The fear of being perceived as “soft” or “weak” is an obstacle
for many men that stop them from challenging sexist attitudes and behaviors. Our conforming to traditional male
socialization prohibits us from confronting the abuse and objectification of women by other men. This belief
system negatively impacts men and women and the ways that we raise, educate, and socialize our boys and girls.
It is essential that men hold other men accountable for their violence. We must use our effort, resources and
influence within our communities to create appropriate and effective systems of accountability for men’s violence
and abuse toward women. Every community and social system that is a part of our society is influenced or run by
men. When we collectively decide to confront the issue of men’s violence against women in a serious and
meaningful way, we can end the terror and abuse.
Create Systems of Accountability to Women in Your Community: As men who are part of the solution to end
violence against women and sexism, our success is dependent on seeking the leadership of women and allowing
that leadership to guide us. We must be informed by the knowledge, experience and voice of the women who are
also dedicated to undoing sexism and ending all forms of violence against women. If we do not listen to, invest in
and believe the voice of women we are once again maintaining the imbalance of power and reinforcing our status
while we continue to marginalize women and their experience. After all, women are the experts on our violence
and abuse toward them. The dominating group cannot define the oppression for those who are oppressed.
The moment we as men decide to fully own our responsibility for violence against women we will be on the road
to social change. This will require integrity, accountability and consistency through action. Once we commit to
this way of life women will not need to worry about where they go, what they wear, or if they are safe. The day
when we, along with our sisters, have redefined manhood so that violence is not a part of being a man. We hope
for a time when we will be respected for the peace, honor and respect that we demonstrate.
Finally, women do not need to be rescued or saved by men. What is needed, however, is for men not to be abusive
or violent. When men end the abuse, safety will take care of itself.

Rachel Kindred

Subject: ATTN: Supervising agent

Dear FBI:  I was not aware that there was a field office in Raleigh, hence I sent the following complaint to the FBI in Charlotte <stacie.keen@ic.fbi.gov>.  After this email below, I was blocked, although they did get several of my emails.  I assume the following names are familiar to you, Mr. McMillan is the President of the NC Bar Association.  I filed this complaint a year and a half ago and nothing happened.  It is revived. Below is a statement of facts.  I have a JD although I am not licensed to practice.  So far, I have not been able to secure representation, although I am trying to find John Edwards to speak with him about this.  As far as I'm concerned, this has been one gigantic cover-up.  Would you care to explain why the FBI has not taken any action?  Has the FBI launched an Internal Affairs Investigation as to why no action was taken a year and a half ago?  I am a citizen of the United States.  I reported a prima facie
violation of my Constitutional rights to every level of law enforcement of the state.  Noone made a determination of probable cause, let alone made arrests.  I believe that warrants a RICO investigation.   To say that I am irate would be the understatement of the 21st century.  Where do we stand?

Sincerely,
Rachel Kindred

Subject: RICO applied

A citizen reports a prima facie violation of her Constitutional rights to Lopez, Hodge, Council, 30 members of the command staff, the County Attorney Kitchen, the City Attorney Blinder, the FBI, the Bar via its agent, and Attorney General Cooper.  Did I miss anyone? Once even the possibility of a federal crime has been reported, RICO seems to make it clear that law enforcement possesses the duty to determine probable cause.  Refusal to determine probable cause if even the possibility of a federal violation has committed falls directly under the scope of RICO.  If two or more people discussed what do or not to do to accomplish an illegal objective, in this case a) violating a citizens first amendment right and b) refusing to determine probable cause then an overt act has taken place, then another crime of conspiracy exists.  Conspiracy is a separate crime and does not merge into the
underlying offense.  How is it that a citizen can report to every level of law enforcement in the state and have there be no action?  We know that is the way they do business in Zimbabwe, but in the United States?  I can't even wrap my mind around the monstrosity of that.

A city has the right to place time, place, and manner restrictions on a citizen's exercise of her first amendment right to free speech.  We just received an email from Patrick Baker that the City has never had the latter in place.  All anyone had to do was tell me that.  However, a police department acts unconstitutionally when it exercises UNFETTERED DISCRETION.  Refusing to advise a citizen of its permit and use of force procedures has no other purpose than to place that citizen in fear and is a prima facie violation of that citizen's 1st amendment rights.  Ron Evans told me when he was schmoozing me to pack up my picket sign and go home that "everyone knows you're crazy."  What kind of crazy am I, exactly?  Cherry Hill crazy?  Upon objective examination, you will find everyone thinks I'm crazy because I do not allow others to control me.  I do not trade sexual favors to gain influence or win city money.  When I get pushed around by
bullies, I fight back.  Even if I were crazy by some clinical standard, I note that crazy people are protected by the Constitution, too.   There was violence in the air around the back of the PD that week, and it was directed at me.  Could there be any other purpose to not informing me of permit procedures other than to show me who was boss?  Don't I have the right to know if I'm going to get beaten up if I'm protesting without a picket permit?  To make me scared?  To put me in my place?  To control me?  To pay me back?   I was so scared that I flashedback to when I was raped in my early 20's.  I was so scared you people made me cry.  Ron was right there, he walked me around the block.

 So let me tell you my intent.  I want an analysis of probable cause on the constititional violation, the civil rights conspiracy statute, and the RICO statute.  If probable cause is found against 50 people, then I want 50 people arrested.  I want them to be held without bond.  I want them to do jail time if found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  If probable cause is not found, there be better some airtight shit going on in that analsis cause I'm gonna pick it apart like I'm picking out fleas out of a hounddog's head.  And the city of Durham, the County, and the State need to come up with $10million each.  That is my civil settlement demand.  Ironically, no lawyer will return my call so this is still a DIY Constitutional revolution.  You people took oaths to defend the Constitution.  This is what defending the Constitution looks like.  Plus you made me scared and made me cry.  I will never stop.

Pay up.

Rachel Kindred

Subject: NC Atty General's website

Last week, this blurb was on the front page of the atty general's website, now it has been moved to FAQ.  Why?  And BTW this falls under the category of "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"  First, I note that the Atty general got well and truly involved in the Duke Lacrosse case, and so this standard does not, obviously, apply to the rich and powerful.  Second, you can see from my efforts how this hands-off policy applies to the real world.  I am uniquely stubborn--do you think anybody else would be stupid enough to pay the cost of what this quest for justice is costing me?  Ha, Ha. Governor, you can change this political policy with one Executive Order.  Set up a hotline so citizens can report government corruption in City Hall, police departments, District Attorneys, and Sheriffs department to someone who gives a crap. CrimeStoppers would be a great model.   Maybe an ADA or a cop would have called during the Duke Lacrosse case.  That is the obvious
lesson learned from Mike Nifong, and y'all didn't do it.  Why?  What vested interest do you have in protecting city and county officials who violate the Constitution against economically helpless American citizens?  It would be interesting to find out how many complaints has your Atty General received and covered-up about city and county governments, PD, and Sheriffs offices...How many, Mr. Cooper? I have a public records/FOI request outstanding...y'all don't even follow the law yourselves.  Gag on y'all.

Complaints About Local Officials
District Attorneys:
In North Carolina, district attorneys are Constitutional officers directly elected by the people in the district where they serve and are not a part of the Attorney General's Office. Complaints against a member of a local district attorney's office should be directed to the staff member's immediate supervisor and, if unresolved, to the district attorney.
Local Police:
Local police departments are not supervised by the NC Department of Justice. Complaints against a member of a police department should be directed to the officer's immediate supervisor and, if unresolved, to the Chief of Police. The Chief of Police usually reports to a city or town manager (police commissioner in some small towns) who ultimately reports to the Mayor and the City/Town Council.
Local Sheriffs:
In North Carolina, Sheriffs are Constitutional officers directly elected by the people in county where they serve. Sheriffs' Offices are not supervised by the NC Department of Justice. Complaints against a member of a Sheriff's Office should be directed to the officer's immediate supervisor and, if unresolved, to the Sheriff.

Dear Governor Perdue:  A year and a half ago, I picketed at the back of the Durham PD.  The Durham PD and City Hall refused to advise me of picket permit requirements and use-of-force procedures.  That is a prima facie violation of my Constitutional rights. I picketed anyway and was scared to death. I believe the evidence will show that the command staff intended to put me in fear.  Lopez was well-briefed even before he came to Durham.   I reported to every level of law enforcement in the state: Lopez, Hodge, 30 members of the command staff, Sheriff Hill, County Attorney Kitchen, and Attorney General Roy Cooper to get help in getting permit and use-of-force proceudres.  In addition, I requested the help of several attorneys: Baker, Sindelair, Clement, Kitchen, and your Attorney general Cooper.  Noone did anything even as I exercised my right to speak in deathly fear at the back of the PD.    Mr. McMillan, President of the NC Bar is
in receipt of the details, as is the FBI and the people cc:d above.  I am getting stonewalled and stonewalled.  I made a very reasonable request below, and these people seem to be having an issue with dealing with me, contrary to public records law.  I am a JD but cannot find a lawyer. I am also being treated unfairly since I would love to have a lawyer but am unemployed, so I got to DIY.  I have requested an Internal Affairs investigation of the PD and the FBI and filed a complaint against several attorneys with the Bar, including your Attorney General Cooper.   I have requested a RICO investigation based on Obstruction of Justice and the civil rights conspiracy statute.  Madame Governor, the Duke Lacrosse legacy will never be over until Durham is cleaned up. How can you help?  Respectfully, Rachel Kindred, JD

I notice from the organizational charts on the DPD website that Captain Evans is no longer the District 5 commander as he was a year and a half ago nor is he the Executive Officer to Bev Council anymore...the only reference to him is on the obviously outdated contact list, he was taken off the organizational charts...was he forced to retire?  was he subjected to any disciplinary action?  was he subject to an internal affairs investigation?  was he directed down to manage me by Hodge?  Was he acting on orders?  From whom?   What orders was he acting on?   Was he interviewed?  Why are Internal Affairs complaints against regular officers public and complaints against the command staff not?   Why was I not given a status report of my complaints as is procedure stated by the Durham PD's own policies?  Did anyone from the City Council, city Attorney, or City Manager communicate with anyone at the PD about the complaints I raised?   Mr.
Bonfield, please tell me the procedures I need to follow (format) to get a complete documentary record.  Obviously, no lawsuit has been filed, so this entire matter is outside the scope of the litigation process, including claims of governmental immunity.  As far as I'm concerned, this is a criminal matter.  If the FBI will send me an email that these questions are being addressed and the documentary record being requested, then I will merely ask for a duplicate of everything that is turned over to them in that investigation....Mr. McMillan, what is the status of my complaints to the Bar about the attorneys in question:  Baker, Clement, Blinder, Sindelair, Kitchen, Cooper, the Police Attorneys?  FBI, has an Internal Affairs investigation been launched?  What's the delay?

ENDING MEN'S VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
By Ted Bunch
My most memorable experience of what a full sense of privilege probably feels like was when I first received myE-Z Pass for my car. E-Z Pass is a device that allows tolls to be automatically deducted from the driver’s accountso that cash is not needed and therefore you get processed through tolls much faster when traveling. As Iapproached the toll, the tollgate began to rise and I drove through with no delay. I looked back at the long line of
cars in the cash lane. I remember thinking as I watched the gate rise for me to pass that this must be what it is liketo be a white man in America. I had access and privileges that made me feel welcome and preferred.
My male privilege as a black man is different; it does not go everywhere I go. For instance, if the police stop mewhile I am driving my car, I instinctively know to keep my hands on the steering wheel at the 10:00 and 2:00 position. I don’t believe that the average white male experiences the police in the same way. This is because his
male privilege is directly connected to and cannot be separated from his race privilege. However, even men ofcolor, while being marginalized by racism, continue to experience the privileges and entitlements associated with
being male. The benefit of this privilege operates in virtually every household, from the oldest male member to
the youngest male child. Our privilege consists of rights, power and advantages given to men by men. Men control
these rights and monitor them often at the expense of women.
Naming The Problem: Domestic violence, rape, sexual assault and all forms of violence against women are the
manifestation of sexism. The violence and abuse by men toward women is rooted in our history, our laws and
woven into the fabric of our society. It must be contextualized within the construct of sexism, because male
privilege, patriarchy and misogyny support this violence. The privileges, entitlements and advantage that we as
men receive from the existing social and political construct provide us with support to act in overtly and covertly
demeaning, oppressive, controlling and abusive ways toward women. Our culture and norms are founded on the
belief that women have less value than men, and that the role of women is for the benefit, use, entertainment and
pleasure of men.
For many years, concerned citizens, activists, advocates and many other dedicated people have made great efforts
to end men’s violence against women. The anti-rape and sexual assault community as well as the domestic
violence community have been a tremendous change agent and have made remarkable progress in the effort to
create safety, justice and fairness for women. Unfortunately, despite years of great effort, sacrifice and loss of life,
the terror that women experience has not decreased. Men continue to get away with their violence, abuse,
intimidation as well as the misuse of power for the purpose of controlling and dominating women. This is no
reflection on those communities or any other effort for change. However, it is a reflection on men and the lack of
concern that we as men have for most issues affecting women. This is especially disturbing because the pain,
suffering, exploitation and immeasurable loss that women experience is almost always due to violence and abuse
at the hands of men.
Domestic violence, rape and sexual assault are the most devastating health issues and social problems facing our
society. There is no other problem, disease or illness that claims as many victims. In almost every case the
perpetrator is a male and the victim is a female. No other crime or social ill has such a destructive effect on
families, children, communities or the workplace than men’s violence against women. For this reason, if for no
other, it is vital that men become involved in the effort to end men’s violence against women. Each man
individually, and we as men collectively, must take a stand and own up to our responsibility to challenge other
men and end the violence that we allow to be perpetrated against women in our communities.
1
The American Medical Association estimates that almost 4 million men severely assault their intimate female
partner or spouse each year. Men’s violence against their intimate female partner is the leading cause of injury for
women, and is the cause of at least 35% of all emergency room visits. Every day approximately 4 men kill their
present or former intimate female partner. As many as 75% of those men murder the women they were partnered
with during or after a separation. It is estimated that 25% of men batter during a woman’s pregnancy. The U.S.
Department of Justice reports that men will rape 1 out of 6 women and commit more than 300,000 acts of rape
and sexual assault every year. It is estimated that 84% of rape and sexual assault goes unreported. In addition,
more than 80% of those women and girls will be under the age of 25. It is a fact that more than 3 out of 4 rapists
will know the women they rape. In fact there is not a moment or second during any day that men are not violating,
assaulting or exploiting women. Men are responsible for a multi-billion dollar industry that supports and promotes
the commercial sexual exploitation, enslavement and trafficking of women. There is no time that women are safe
or free from fear.
If we as men choose not to become involved in ending our violence against women it is because we choose to
remain invested in maintaining our privilege and advantage. Our privileges and entitlements can only come at the
expense of women. Any violence, abuse or degradation committed toward a woman by a man supports the status
of men as the dominating group while also reinforcing the oppression of women. There is no neutral position or
stance for men to take. We can either choose to become part of the solution or remain part of the problem.
The Use of Accountable Language: Violence against women is a violation of human rights. If any group were to
attack another group of people who are law abiding, peaceful, loving and productive members of a society, the
group that was the aggressor would be brought up on human rights violations. Here in the United States men,
women and children are socialized to protect the status of men. We protect men in our language and our
terminology. We almost always frame the issue of domestic violence and violence against women as a “women’s
issue”. By categorizing domestic violence, rape, sexual assault and other forms of violence against women as a
"women’s" issue we automatically minimize the seriousness of the problem and therefore the importance of it and
ultimately the attention men give the issues. The majority of our citizens are women. Yet, we continue to define
them as a “special interest group” or as a “minority group” not because of their numbers but because of their lack
of influence, resources and perceived lack of value.
We must all begin to use language that speaks to the issue of men perpetrating violence and that is accountable.
Rarely, if ever, do we refer to violence against women as an issue for men to confront. The lack of desire to name
the problem is not by coincidence. It is just one way that we protect men by placing the focus on women and on
their victimization, there by diverting attention away from the men who perpetrate the crimes. We all have learned
well to value and protect men while giving less value or concern for women. The use of our language and the way
we organize our thinking around issues concerning women is often presented in a way not to offend men or make
men uncomfortable. We label men’s violence against women with terms like gender violence, relationship abuse,
intimate partner violence and other similarly generic and neutral terms. The inaccurate naming of the problem
continues to remove responsibility and accountability from men. Even the term “domestic violence” does not
speak to the issue and places no responsibility on the offender.
Most offenses that men perpetrate against women that are illegal and arrestable go unreported and without any
form of consequence. The overwhelming majority of the men that do enter the criminal justice system do not
experience prosecution and the small percentages that are prosecuted receive little or no penalty. In operating the
largest batterers’ program in the country, it is clear that men who abuse, batter and assault share much more in
common with all men than they share differences. The belief systems and sense of entitlement are one in the same.
Both groups of men, those who are well meaning and those who perpetrate violence, have been socialized to
support the idea that they have rights that take precedence over the rights of woman and children.
2
The Socialization of Men: Specific beliefs, norms, and expectations are taught to men and boys, which assist
them in maintaining and reinforcing the control of their socially constructed and sanctioned male dominance. The
foundation that our traditional male socialization is built upon has three key elements of belief about women. The
first is the belief that women have less value or worth than men. The second is that women are to be considered as
property belonging to men. Finally, women are viewed as objects (to be objectified by men) which again
reinforces their status of having less value. We receive constant messages from every segment of our society that
reinforce and strengthen this foundation. Due to this belief system, when women are victims of violence, rape or
abuse, many men tend not to identify with the victim and do not experience any meaningful concern toward her
circumstance or situation. Moreover, most men consider themselves to be well intentioned and one of the “good
guys”. These men do not see themselves as men who would ever engage in violent or abusive behavior. In their
minds, they are exempt from fault and therefore have minimal concern about how other men behave toward
women.
However, most men often blame women for their victimization and excuse men for their abusive behaviors.
We tend to judge a woman before we believe a woman. We do this by showing support for men and skepticism
toward women. We often create a defense for men in our minds or with other men to excuse the abuser or rapists’
behavior. We too often seek to eliminate his fault while we blame her for his abuse. Men almost immediately
begin to examine what she wore, where she was and offer other excuses that have absolutely nothing to do with a
man’s choice to violate a woman.
Most tactics of control, abuse and oppression are not illegal. On a conscious and an unconscious level many men
engage in disrespectful, intimidating, and controlling behaviors. Most men who are abusive in these ways have not
broken any law and will never be a part of the criminal justice system; nor do they consider themselves to be
abusive. All men are not batterers, rapists, or abusive and many of us are not fully aware of the extent of our
privileges. However, all men do have the latitude to abuse power within their relationship and get away with it.
Due to the ever-present privilege that exists for men, the decision to abuse that power or to be egalitarian and
respectful is an individual decision and usually made on a daily basis. Yet, when forced to acknowledge abuse,
well meaning men consider other men who abuse and assault to be different from them and are quick to separate
themselves from the abuser. We look for ways to excuse or analyze the abusive man’s behavior. We attempt to
remove responsibility for his choices and actions by viewing his “outbursts” as pathological. We very often
excuse his violence and abuse by placing the blame on his anger. The assumption that a loss of control occurred is
incorrect. It is clear that he is fully capable of demonstrating restraint and control of his anger and his behavior
when he chooses. We too often seek to diagnose his abuse and attempt to provide treatment for his behavior.
There is no treatment because there is no sickness. As women have informed us “men’s violence against women is
a social ill, not an individual pathology, requiring social change not social work.”
Men Value Women Less: In our society we have a double standard concerning violence that men perpetrate
toward the women they are partnered with versus the violence that men perpetrate toward a stranger or nonintimate
partner. Men who break the law in both instances are hopefully arrested. If they are arrested they are
placed on two separate tracks within the criminal justice system and held to quite different standards of
accountability. Men who are violent toward their partner are given less of a penalty, consequence or sanction than
men who perpetrate the identical violence toward anyone else. Even men of color, when perpetrating crimes
against a female partner, experience leniency in the criminal justice system as a norm when compared to penalties
they receive associated with other crimes. Therefore, the moment a woman becomes identified as being the
intimate partner of a man, her value automatically decreases. Justice is no longer based on the crime that the man
committed, but rather whom the crime was committed against. This injustice should not be surprising. As a rule,
the social construct of sexism dictates that provisions, allowances and exceptions are to be made for men.
Consider if a person was anti-Semitic or acted out in a racist manner. What excuses would we come up with for
that behavior? What prescription or treatment would we offer to cure this prejudice? What term would our
3
therapists and clinicians find in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual to diagnose such hatred? These questions
sound ridiculous because we would not pathologize this behavior or belief; nor would we attempt to make excuses
for it. We would simply say stop it! It’s wrong and it is not acceptable! Everyone knows that such behavior breaks
the social contract and civilized folks don’t act that way. In addition, it would not matter if the anti-Semitic person
grew up in an anti-Semitic household or environment. It would not matter if the bigotry or racism were
“generational” or if the person was under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the offense. Individual
citizens and the entire community would fully understand that there is no excuse or reason for such behaviors.
Furthermore, the person of color or the Jewish person would not be blamed for the abusive act that was
perpetrated against them.
The Collusion of “Well Meaning” Men: I would like to believe that the majority of men are well meaning. It is
this group, however, that is responsible for supporting the epidemic of violence that the abusive men inflict upon
women. Men who choose to remain silent constantly reinforce the abusive man’s behavior. Our silence is also our
permission. While the intent of our silence may not be to cause harm, it does. The decision to not speak out is an
act of collusion and serves to preserve the privilege of men. The silence of men normalizes the abuser’s behavior
and this causes additional harm to women. We do this in many ways. Sometimes it is as simple as remaining silent
when a sexist joke is told or not challenging a friend who makes a statement that degrades women or is
threatening to women.
“Well-meaning” men consciously and subconsciously separate themselves from men who batter and abuse while
simultaneously giving them permission to do so. Well-meaning men consider themselves different from the
perpetrator because they have an imaginary line that they will not cross. This line represents the separation of
what are abusive behaviors from non-abusive behavior and who is a “good guy” from a “bad guy.” The wellmeaning
man, at times, will go right up against the line of inappropriate behavior. But, as long as he doesn’t cross
it (or get caught crossing it) he is still considered a “good guy”. Meanwhile, many of us have at least thought
about doing or saying things that are similar to what the abusive man says or does. When men do not speak out
about violence against women they are taking an active and/or passive role in affirming the violence. When we
remain by-standers we are making a choice to support the abuse. The abusive behavior by any man reflects and
therefore reinforces the established status and privileges of all men.
Recognizing Our Privilege and Entitlement: As men we are members of the dominating group. Because of this
membership, each individual man automatically receives the benefits available to the group as a whole. Even
those of us who may not want the benefits, privileges and entitlements that are given to men, as part of the
dominating group we have access to the benefits and privileges given to the entire group. In other words, men who
are well meaning, who choose to confront their sexism and their male privilege will continue to benefit from the
sexist construct that exist for their benefit and comfort. These advantages have been established and maintained
for their benefit and are outside of their control. Another example of this is the benefit of white privilege. White
people who are well meaning and choose to address their racism and their race privilege will continue to benefit
from the racist construct that exist and was established and maintained for their benefit and comfort. Even if and
when they do not want their race privilege or advantage to exist, it is still present.
Therefore, all men benefit from men’s violence against women. The well-meaning men and the perpetrator have a
silent partnership. The perpetrator is the enforcer of the rules that the well-meaning men have helped design, live
by, support and benefit from. In return, the well-meaning man does nothing and says nothing about the
objectification, the control or the abusive behavior. Our silence and our permission are synonymous.
How Men Can Become Part of The Solution: Violence against women is a problem that each man must own
and make a personal commitment to end. While some men are the perpetrators all men are the benefactors of the
conditions that allow violence against women. It will not end until we, as men, decide that it will. It begins with
our challenging our own sexism, privileges and beliefs. We must take ownership of the problem in order to create
4
positive social change. It will require honesty, sacrifice and transparency. In addition to examining our views
toward women (individually and collectively) we must also challenge our views and beliefs about each other. A
major obstacle will be to confront our traditional male socialization and how it limits us and boxes us in. We must
get out of the socially defined roles that sexism, patriarchy and male privilege provide for us. In addition, we must
end our collusion with the violence, objectification and demeaning thoughts and behaviors that we as men engage
in toward women. This will require that we address our fears and anxiety about stepping out of our defined roles
and challenge the traditional images of manhood. The fear of being perceived as “soft” or “weak” is an obstacle
for many men that stop them from challenging sexist attitudes and behaviors. Our conforming to traditional male
socialization prohibits us from confronting the abuse and objectification of women by other men. This belief
system negatively impacts men and women and the ways that we raise, educate, and socialize our boys and girls.
It is essential that men hold other men accountable for their violence. We must use our effort, resources and
influence within our communities to create appropriate and effective systems of accountability for men’s violence
and abuse toward women. Every community and social system that is a part of our society is influenced or run by
men. When we collectively decide to confront the issue of men’s violence against women in a serious and
meaningful way, we can end the terror and abuse.
Create Systems of Accountability to Women in Your Community: As men who are part of the solution to end
violence against women and sexism, our success is dependent on seeking the leadership of women and allowing
that leadership to guide us. We must be informed by the knowledge, experience and voice of the women who are
also dedicated to undoing sexism and ending all forms of violence against women. If we do not listen to, invest in
and believe the voice of women we are once again maintaining the imbalance of power and reinforcing our status
while we continue to marginalize women and their experience. After all, women are the experts on our violence
and abuse toward them. The dominating group cannot define the oppression for those who are oppressed.
The moment we as men decide to fully own our responsibility for violence against women we will be on the road
to social change. This will require integrity, accountability and consistency through action. Once we commit to
this way of life women will not need to worry about where they go, what they wear, or if they are safe. The day
when we, along with our sisters, have redefined manhood so that violence is not a part of being a man. We hope
for a time when we will be respected for the peace, honor and respect that we demonstrate.
Finally, women do not need to be rescued or saved by men. What is needed, however, is for men not to be abusive
or violent. When men end the abuse, safety will take care of itself.


Sincerely,
Rachel Kindred

Dear FBI:  I was not aware that there was a field office in Raleigh, hence I sent the following complaint to the FBI in Charlotte <stacie.keen@ic.fbi.gov>.  After this email below, I was blocked, although they did get several of my emails.  I assume the following names are familiar to you, Mr. McMillan is the President of the NC Bar Association.  I filed this complaint a year and a half ago and nothing happened.  It is revived. Below is a statement of facts.  I have a JD although I am not licensed to practice.  So far, I have not been able to secure representation, although I am trying to find John Edwards to speak with him about this.  As far as I'm concerned, this has been one gigantic cover-up.  Would you care to explain why the FBI has not taken any action?  Has the FBI launched an Internal Affairs Investigation as to why no action was taken a year and a half ago?  I am a citizen of the United States.  I reported a prima facie
violation of my Constitutional rights to every level of law enforcement of the state.  Noone made a determination of probable cause, let alone made arrests.  I believe that warrants a RICO investigation.   To say that I am irate would be the understatement of the 21st century.  Where do we stand?

Sincerely,
Rachel Kindred

Subject: RICO applied

A citizen reports a prima facie violation of her Constitutional rights to Lopez, Hodge, Council, 30 members of the command staff, the County Attorney Kitchen, the City Attorney Blinder, the FBI, the Bar via its agent, and Attorney General Cooper.  Did I miss anyone? Once even the possibility of a federal crime has been reported, RICO seems to make it clear that law enforcement possesses the duty to determine probable cause.  Refusal to determine probable cause if even the possibility of a federal violation has committed falls directly under the scope of RICO.  If two or more people discussed what do or not to do to accomplish an illegal objective, in this case a) violating a citizens first amendment right and b) refusing to determine probable cause then an overt act has taken place, then another crime of conspiracy exists.  Conspiracy is a separate crime and does not merge into the
underlying offense.  How is it that a citizen can report to every level of law enforcement in the state and have there be no action?  We know that is the way they do business in Zimbabwe, but in the United States?  I can't even wrap my mind around the monstrosity of that.

A city has the right to place time, place, and manner restrictions on a citizen's exercise of her first amendment right to free speech.  We just received an email from Patrick Baker that the City has never had the latter in place.  All anyone had to do was tell me that.  However, a police department acts unconstitutionally when it exercises UNFETTERED DISCRETION.  Refusing to advise a citizen of its permit and use of force procedures has no other purpose than to place that citizen in fear and is a prima facie violation of that citizen's 1st amendment rights.  Ron Evans told me when he was schmoozing me to pack up my picket sign and go home that "everyone knows you're crazy."  What kind of crazy am I, exactly?  Cherry Hill crazy?  Upon objective examination, you will find everyone thinks I'm crazy because I do not allow others to control me.  I do not trade sexual favors to gain influence or win city money.  When I get pushed around by
bullies, I fight back.  Even if I were crazy by some clinical standard, I note that crazy people are protected by the Constitution, too.   There was violence in the air around the back of the PD that week, and it was directed at me.  Could there be any other purpose to not informing me of permit procedures other than to show me who was boss?  Don't I have the right to know if I'm going to get beaten up if I'm protesting without a picket permit?  To make me scared?  To put me in my place?  To control me?  To pay me back?   I was so scared that I flashedback to when I was raped in my early 20's.  I was so scared you people made me cry.  Ron was right there, he walked me around the block.

 So let me tell you my intent.  I want an analysis of probable cause on the constititional violation, the civil rights conspiracy statute, and the RICO statute.  If probable cause is found against 50 people, then I want 50 people arrested.  I want them to be held without bond.  I want them to do jail time if found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  If probable cause is not found, there be better some airtight shit going on in that analsis cause I'm gonna pick it apart like I'm picking out fleas out of a hounddog's head.  And the city of Durham, the County, and the State need to come up with $10million each.  That is my civil settlement demand.  Ironically, no lawyer will return my call so this is still a DIY Constitutional revolution.  You people took oaths to defend the Constitution.  This is what defending the Constitution looks like.  Plus you made me scared and made me cry.  I will never stop.

Pay up.

Rachel Kindred

Why the hell should I protect the NAACP?  See below.  Did any of you ask the question of how Al Sharpton and the Black Panthers came to town?  What connection is there between City Hall and the PD and the NAACP, if any?  why don't you seize computers and see how far a RICO investigation extends? Donb't forget the home computers, too.  Plenty of business is conducted at home. Why are you so scared of the NAACP?  Politics, right?  You don't want Mr. Barber to come out and say boo.  Well, this is a late breaking newsflash but history is replete of instances when the oppressed become the oppressor.  Believe it or not, some black people are unmitigated assholes too.  Here, let me be the first.  Mr. Barber, take your racial politics and your racial rhetoric and your racial influence and shove them up your ass.   Y'all remind of a collective Lurch...you hide, you dodge, you cower behind your titles, and your importance, and your power.  All of

Tick-tock on the status of my requests for a RICO investigation, Bar investigation, and records' requests....anyone care to report in?  Mr. Barber, I'm flattered that you felt so threatened by my questions that you made a point of being quoted by both papers, the H-S and the N & O, in the last week.  POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

GOAL OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL REVOLUTION:  To achieve a poor man's Constitutional revolution by first exposing the virtual impossibility that a working-class citizen can expect to receive justice from an incestuous system of rich, powerful, and politically co-dependent lawyers, politicians, and law enforcement who prefer to cover-up systematic abuses of citizens' rights rather than apply justice even-handedly.  Second, to demonstrate that the Durham establishment's contempt for the Constitution existed long before the Duke Lacrosse case and continues on today.  Third, to shame the state into setting up a mechanism by which the average citizen can report, and expect investigation and prosecution of, those government agents who violate state or federal law.  The poor do not have access to legal counsel nor do we have any hope that the powerful will police the powerful.  The only check and balance against the crushing power of the State is the right of
 citizens to speak out.  Cops and soldiers defend my right to speak with their blood on the streets and in foreign lands.   It is my duty to exercise my right to speak radically in order to honor their collective sacrifice.

Tick-tock on the status of my requests for a RICO investigation, Bar investigation, and records' requests....anyone care to report in?  Mr. Barber, I'm flattered that you felt so threatened by my questions that you made a point of being quoted by both papers, the H-S and the N & O, in the last week.  POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

GOAL OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL REVOLUTION:  To achieve a poor man's Constitutional revolution by first exposing the virtual impossibility that a working-class citizen can expect to receive justice from an incestuous system of rich, powerful, and politically co-dependent lawyers, politicians, and law enforcement who prefer to cover-up systematic abuses of citizens' rights rather than apply justice even-handedly.  Second, to demonstrate that the Durham establishment's contempt for the Constitution existed long before the Duke Lacrosse case and continues on today.  Third, to shame the state into setting up a mechanism by which the average citizen can report, and expect investigation and prosecution of, those government agents who violate state or federal law.  The poor do not have access to legal counsel nor do we have any hope that the powerful will police the powerful.  The only check and balance against the crushing power of the State is the right of
citizens to speak out.  Cops and soldiers defend my right to speak with their blood on the streets and in foreign lands.   It is my duty to exercise my right to speak radically in order to honor their collective sacrifice.  Every American should remember that a government agent's most ferocious nightmare is a citizen with a picket sign who never gives up.  I never will.

Mr. Kitchen, did anyone bother to tell you I made a complaint against you with Mr. McMillan of the State Bar because you failed to report those attys who refused to advise me of permit requirements and use-of-force procedures?  Did you contact anyone anywhere?  I'm sorry, I really can't support immunity in exchange for flipping, as a matter of general principle.  Have a great week.

Sincerely,
Rachel Kindred

Just in case y'all missed it, the idiot Sindelar actually emailed me back. Below.  I forwarded it you but  wanted to send it again just to make sure you saw it. See this was dumb because if memory serves correctly, I haven't sent an email out without cc:ing Stan Chambers at the N & O.  And I do believe he kept all my emails, which means this is a lie in writing.  tick-tock on that delicious probable cause.  FBI, DOJ, you coming or what?  You guys take way too long to get it in gear.  Mr. McMillan where the hell is the Bar?  JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE NOW!

Dear Ms. Kindred:

I hadn't been notified of your complaint, so thank you for letting me know.  Actually, I don't have any history with the topics you are referring to in your email below -- the picket permit and use of force procedure.  It's clear from your email below that you are frustrated with government.  It can be hard, I know, to make your voice heard, and I regret that you've had problems.

Sincerely,
Karen Sindelar
Senior Assistant City Attorney


Sincerely,
Rachel Kindred
