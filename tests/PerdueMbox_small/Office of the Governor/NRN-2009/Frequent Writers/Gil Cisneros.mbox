An American Entrepreneur‚Äôs Perspective on the

Business Opportunities in Peru in 2009



By: Daniel R. Meylan

President and Founder - Weavers

<mailto:dmeylan@weaversonline.org>dmeylan@weaversonline.org







I am an American businessman with 36 years of banking and insurance experience. I have been I involved in multiple new businesses and have watched the United States economy and business environment ebb and flow over the last 36 years. I currently teach and consult with emerging business owners throughout the United States. From March 1 to March 6, 2009 I had the good fortune to join a United States Trade Mission to Peru as a guest of the Chamber of the Americas, headquartered in Denver Colorado. The purpose of this trade mission was to introduce Colorado and Texas businesses to the extensive economic opportunities that currently exist in Peru. Gil Cisneros the Executive Director of the Chamber the Americas did an marvelous job organizing a series of meetings with top Peruvian and US government officials as well key Peruvian business leaders. Every day for the three days of our mission we heard the same encouraging story about Peru from the perspective of each individual presenter from the both the public and private sectors of the Peruvian economy. Here were the prevailing themes:

Peru is a great place to do business!

Peru is a safe and secure place to invest in business!

Peru is a vibrant and growing country!

Peru has incredible natural and human resources!

The Peruvian‚Äôs, as a people have an attitude of eager expectation about

their immediate and long term future!

Peru offers considerable business opportunities and security for those

††††††††† businesses that are willing to make an investment in Peru!

The public and private sectors within Peru have formed a strong alliance to

foster and promote the growth of the Peruvian economy!



When the trade mission was complete I extended my stay to make myself more familiar with the grass roots opportunities within the country and to provide business consulting and teaching services to a group of emerging business owners. What I heard and saw and experienced during that additional time confirmed everything we had heard during the trade mission.† The commerce I observed from retail consumer activity, to restaurant crowds, to people engaged in gainful employment, to intense traffic and an airport jammed to capacity in the middle of the night served to support that Peru is indeed a vibrant and thriving country.† American based franchises from Burger King to Starbucks, to Papa Johns Pizza were all being patronized at a level beyond what we would see today in the United States.† In a large women‚Äôs clothing store in downtown Lima we saw people standing in multiple cash register lines 25 deep to pay for their purchases after 8pm on a Thursday evening. A comparable store in America today would be all but vacant at that hour of the week. I did not have time to visit the interior of the country but am planning to organize another trip to Peru later in 2009 with a group of US business owners where we will take the time to explore the business opportunities throughout Peru.

††††††††† For those American‚Äôs who would like to seriously consider possible business opportunities in Peru the best resource is the American Chamber of Commerce of Peru aka AMCHAM <http://www.amcham.org.pe/>www.amcham.org.pe† The American Chamber of Commerce of Peru is an independent non-profit organization founded on January 17, 1968 to represent American, Peruvian and foreign companies. Its membership includes 2500 individuals who represent over 500 companies, whose sales account for 60% of the GDP of Peru. AMCHAM provides a ‚ÄúMatchmaking Service‚Äù that connects interested parties wanting to engage in business to or from Peru.†

Gil,



I'm glad your trip to Veracruz went well, if not a little on the hot side.



Anyway, I'm not sure if the veracruzanos†were quite as upset as the chilangos were about the mistreatment of Mexico by their neighbor to the north. In my 20 years of conducting business in Mexico I cannot recall any other trip when so many Mexicans expressed their displeasure with the United States. Clearly, the U.S.-Mexico relationship is more†dysfunctional now than at any other time during the past 30 years.



Lately, U.S. mistreatment of Mexico has increased so much that Mexicans are wondering if these efforts to discredit them are actually being orchestrated by our government and press. Mexicans already wrote off the last 8 years as a lost opportunity to advance our relationship, and now there is already talk about writing off the next 8 years as well. Here are the latest incidents:

* U.S. cancels cross-border trucking pilot program.
* December issue of Forbes asks if Mexico has become a failed state.
* Story about ex-intelligence chief Tenet advising son not to go to Mexico for spring break released to the press.
* State and White House officials questioning Mexico's ability to control narco-traffickers and insinuating that U.S. drug problem is somehow caused by Mexico's inability to control the narcos.
* Protectionist rhetoric woven throughout stimulous package.
* And the most shocking . . . Forbes includes "El Chapo", head of the Sinaloa Cartel, in their "Billionaire Club" list.
For some reason Forbes appears to have decided that its new mission is to wage a publicity war against Mexico. Whatever Forbes' reason, the inclusion of El Chapo alongside legitimate businessmen like Carlos Slim, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett has outraged Mexico, and rightfully so. This type of yellow, muckraking, irresponsible journalism is wrong on so many levels it is unbelievable that a once respected publication like Forbes would do this. It legitimizes a "business" that both the U.S. and Mexico are struggling to fight; it singles out a Mexican criminal (the only wanted person to appear among the 700+ names), when there are certainly other leaders of criminal organizations around the world who have amassed similar fortunes; even Forbes' attempt at calculating El Chapo's wealth was overly simplistic and impossible to substantiate -- the calculation would never meet the minimum journalistic requirement to publish in any newspaper.



I hope you will encourage Chamber members to communicate their displeasure about the current state of affairs with Mexico to their elected representatives. Lets tell our elected officials to get back on track and work on important issues with Mexico and that protectionism will only prolong the recession. Lets tell them that any meaningful dialogue with Mexico regarding the drug trade must involve our taking some responsibility for the problem, not just sending annual report cards to Mexico and other Latin American countries rating their level of "cooperation" in the drug war (forward them the attached cartoon).



Finally, please encourage any Chamber member who subscribes to Forbes to ask the "billionaire list" editor what in the world she was thinking and then promptly cancel their subscription.



Hopefully, will see you again soon. All the best . . .
