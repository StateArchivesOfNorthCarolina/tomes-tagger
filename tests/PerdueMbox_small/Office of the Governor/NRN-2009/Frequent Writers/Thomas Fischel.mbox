Don't know if this is worthy to be a Letter to Editor or not;
It can be if you like it.

Of Retirees & Crock Pots

Since Old Man Winter has set in the past few weeks, we have begun using the
covered back porch as a "Walk Out Freezer" for leftovers.

I decided to make a beef stew and was looking around for a suitable pot.....but,
they were in use out on the back porch "Freezer"  to store leftovers.

Then I remembered there was a ceramic insert and glass lid to an old crock pot
in the basement.....hmmmmm.

Down to the basement to retrieve the pot, only to find it was in deplorable shape. 
After scrubbing with green scratch pads and cleanser, it began to look usable again.

After getting the "From Scratch" stew together, I used the oven to cook it with.
Kinda matches how the crock pot works anyway. The stew turned out so well, that
my wife said " you should patent this".  I told her I might if I could just remember
what I put in it  :))

Next morning looking at the old crock pot on the sink, cleaned up again after doing a
yeoman's job, I thought perhaps one day someone would shine up this old retiree
and make use of him again  :))

There are countless years of experience sitting idle in our retirees of this county.
Some might actually want to embark on a second or third  "semi-career"

True, they do not move about as they used to, but the knowledge stored above the shoulders,
could be an invaluable asset.

Dear Governor Perdue,

We need your help.

Below is a msg to Commissioner  Mark Jones outlining a most severe problem in Jackson County
and the surrounding areas; Lack of high speed Broadband.
Also my response to Ron Masssingale at Balsam-West below that.

Balsam-West has the Fiber in the ground already in several areas, but lacks the funds to hook up small businesses and private homes.
I spoke with Balsam-West, owner of the Fiber cable, installed from Sylva to Cashiers, NC ., funded by Private monies yesterday.
Ron Massingale Vice President of Sales & Marketing,  BalsamWest FiberNet, 704-896-3666

He stated that his company simply can not afford to hook up businesses or private homes along the route of

of their fiber cable due to the high costs of doing so and not being able to show a return.

"Fiber to the Brick" is the term. By far the best method, rather than other methods requiring the use
of the RF Spectrum, causing ( two way ) interference problems to the user of the Broadband and other users
of the RF Spectrum such as EMS folks, Amateur Radio, even CB.
"Fiber to the Brick"  ( straight to the small business or home ) causes no problems and has the best through put speeds.  

Our small businesses create jobs......
They are working at an extreme disadvantage by not being able to utilize the Net other than with Dial-Up service.

Verizon has not upgraded their lines to Fiber ( in the 14 years I have lived here ) and probably will not in my life time.

Balsam-West is a small local company providing jobs in our area.
A private Donor, provided the funds for BalsamWest to install miles of buried fiber cable between Sylva
and Cashiers, NC for the Schools to have high Speed Broadband service. At a Cost of over 2 Million dollars.
It was the only way to get the job done.

So, BalsamWest has the infrastructure to provide many small businesses and homes with high speed broadband
but can not due to the high costs of hooking them up.

Commissioner, Mark Jones
Jackson County
Sylva, NC

GM Mark,

Looks like this new gadget [ Femtocell ] by major Carriers ( Verizon, AT&T & Sprint ) may reduce the need of yet more Cell Towers.
It seems they will be placing Cell Phone repeaters(?) into your Fiber Modem in each home.
Guess that would give better Cell coverage in our rural areas?

Sounds OK, but you are using a BROADBAND connection to do this............which folks on Cullowhee Mountain Road
and many other areas in Jackson County simply do not have. ( Even though, there are Orange & Blue cables of Fiber going right past
our homes.......installed by Balsam West - Sylva, for a private Donor,  providing fiber cable Broadband to our Schools )

I have asked Balsam West on many occasions what possible Time Frame to supply folks (private homes)
with this new Broadband Service. The answer is/was possibly late 2009 or later. Hooking up private homes
is not a priority. Mind, download speeds with Dial Up ( in case you have forgotten ) are incredibly slow.

It also looks like the major phone companies are trying to reduce their losses to VOIP calls placed over the Net via Broadband connectionsand preserve/enhance  their Cell Phone revenues.
Probably a Smart Move on their part. If you can not beat them, join them.....? Saving Big $$$$ in Cell Tower Construction as well.
Again, this new technology only works if you have a Broadband connection already.

The County  Commissioner's recent hard work on creating guide lines for new Cell Towers in our County,
may have been a moot issue, as Technology moves ever forward?

So, what can the  Commissioners do to speed up the deployment of a high speed Broadband Service to those
folks still on Dial Up ( beyond DSL range ) that have fiber right at their front door, with no hope of getting better Net speeds, ever?
Yes, there are two other methods of obtaining Broadband; Hughs Sat and Verizon via a Cell Tower.
Both at additional costs that I am not willing to pay, when there is State of The Art fiber cable at my front door!

Ron Massingale,
BalsamWest

Tnx Ron,

It was great talking with you about the need for broadband in our rural areas for both
small businesses and private homes..

I did phone Kelly at the paper after we spoke. He may be doing an update article in a week or so.

He may give you a call.  The thrust of the article may be the feasabilty of Private, Local, State or Fed funds
to assist in bringing Broadband to our rural areas needing coverage, by way of Jackson County
in some form or fashion via our Board of Commisioner's efforts..

As you pointed out, our small business folks in and around Jackson County are at a disadvantage without
high speed Net service, as well as the private home owners.

Our small business folks are a great source of jobs........that alone should carry some weight.

Funding seems to be the major roadblock, not the availablity of the Fiber( in the ground already ) or the
equipment to hook up  small businesses or private homes with "Fiber to the Brick".
Fiber to the Brick seems to be the best method, in that it does not involve broadcasting on radio freq's
from the Node to the Business/Home. Much higher through put speeds would be had with fiber to the brick
and none of the inherent associated problems with interference using the RF Spectrum.

Sorry to get so long winded on this, but lots of folks have no clue that a BPL, VDSL/2, or ADSL/2 ( copper phone
drop lines to the customer ) system will cause serious communications problems, both ways.

To All;
I have reached my limit on this issue. I hope others will pick up the cause that "Can Do" something about it.
I told my wife about this project and she said, well the worst thing they can tell you is -  No, we can not be of help.......

Tom


Last Up Date;


Dear Gov,

I forgot to mention the same school children helped by the high speed broadband at their Schools in our area, over half or better do not have high speed broadband available to them at their homes, due to the rural areas they live in.
Many could benefit from fiber to their homes that live along the cable route as I do. I know two children next door and five more down the road that may never see Broadband available in their homes, probably in their life times. Again, the cable runs right past their homes.
The Donor of that cable line to our area schools had a very "Can Do" attitude.
Can we count on you to do the same?

Best Regards,


Tom Fischel

> Governor names Dempsey Benton to head the Office of Economic Recovery and Investment

Wednesday, Governor Perdue announced the creation of the Office of Economic Recovery & Investment to coordinate and track North Carolina’s handling of federal stimulus funds as well as state-level economic recovery initiatives.  She named Dempsey Benton, former secretary of the state Health and Human Services Department, to lead the office and provide accountability for use of the recovery dollars.

The federal stimulus package was signed into law this week by President Barack Obama.  It provides about $6.1 billion in direct aid to North Carolina to create jobs and rebuild and expand our state’s critical infrastructure, including highways and schools.  The recovery program will also inject additional money into the state through targeted tax cuts, additional grants from federal agencies and direct funding for specific federal programs in the state.

This temporary office will be assisted by staff in the governor’s office and designated representatives from the various state agencies responsible for administering or distributing the federal stimulus funds.


Agreement signed to provide additional money for unemployed

Thursday, Gov. Perdue signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Labor to provide $25 more per week in federal unemployment insurance benefits to those who qualify under the Unemployed Workers and Struggling Families Act.

February 19th was the earliest the agreement could be executed. The action, part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was passed by Congress and signed by the president, creates a new federally-funded initiative which increases unemployment benefits by $25 a week through calendar year 2009, with a “phase-out” period for previously-qualified individuals. Gov. Perdue and officials from other states had to sign an agreement to act as the agent for disbursing this money.

“We need to do all we can to help people looking for work who have been hard hit by the nation’s economic crisis,” said Gov. Perdue. “I have spoken with Employment Security Commission Chairman Moses Carey, and his staff is already hard at work implementing this initiative as quickly as possible. Within the next few weeks, those unemployed who qualify will begin receiving this money.”


Governor pursues grant money to replace the Yadkin River Bridge

Governor Perdue and NCDOT Secretary Gene Conti will work with Sen. Kay Hagan, Rep. Mel Watt and the rest of North Carolina’s Congressional delegation to obtain funding for the replacement of the Yadkin River Bridge on I-85 in Davidson and Rowan counties.

The federal stimulus and recovery bill signed into law this week by President Obama included $1.5 billion in discretionary grants to be awarded to states for transportation projects.  The estimated cost of the Yadkin River Bridge project is around $300 million.

“North Carolina must preserve the safety and mobility of important transportation links like the Yadkin River Bridge," said Gov. Perdue. "The large price tag, which has made it hard to fund, makes it a perfect candidate for this additional stimulus grant money.”

Cherokee County Manufacturer to Add 40 Jobs

<http://www.snapon.com/>Snap-on Inc., a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools and diagnostic equipment, is expanding its operations in Murphy.  The company plans to invest nearly $2 million and create 40 jobs this year by consolidating operations from a Massachusetts plant to this state.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $120,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

“North Carolina’s manufacturing sector continues to evolve and take advantage of new regional and global opportunities,” Gov. Perdue said. “Snap-on is one of a growing number of companies that know first-hand our state’s excellent workforce, innovative training and education programs, and top business climate.”

Snap-on Inc., headquartered in Wisconsin, is a household name in professional tools and other equipment, with 35 manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide, including 11 U.S. plants.  The Snap-on plant in Murphy, which makes industrial power tools, employs 178 workers.  The company plans to consolidate its power tools manufacturing operation in Massachusetts to Murphy.
