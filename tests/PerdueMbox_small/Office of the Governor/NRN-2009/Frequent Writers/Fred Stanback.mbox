Itâ€™s Survival of the Weak and Scrawny
Researchers see 'evolution in reverse' as hunters kill off prized animals with the biggest antlers and pelts.

Lily Huang
NEWSWEEK
from the magazine issue dated Jan 12, 2009
Some of the most iconic photographs of Teddy Roosevelt, one of the first conservationists in American politics, show the president posing companionably with the prizes of his trophy hunts. An elephant felled in Africa in 1909 points its tusks skyward; a Cape buffalo, crowned with horns in the shape of a handlebar mustache, slumps in a Kenyan swamp. In North America, he stalked deer, pronghorn antelope, bighorn sheep and elk, which he called "lordly game" for their majestic antlers. What's remarkable about these photographs is not that they depict a hunter who was also naturalist John Muir's staunchest political ally. It's that just 100 years after his expeditions, many of the kind of magnificent trophies he routinely captured are becoming rare.

Elk still range across parts of North America, but every hunting season brings a greater challenge to find the sought-after bull with a towering spread of antlers. Africa and Asia still have elephants, but Roosevelt would have regarded most of them as freaks, because they don't have tusks. Researchers describe what's happening as none other than the selection process that Darwin made famous: the fittest of a species survive to reproduce and pass along their traits to succeeding generations, while the traits of the unfit gradually disappear. Selective huntingâ€”picking out individuals with the best horns or antlers, or the largest piece of hideâ€”works in reverse: the evolutionary loser is not the small and defenseless, but the biggest and best-equipped to win mates or fend off attackers.

When hunting is severe enough to outstrip other threats to survival, the unsought, middling individuals make out better than the alpha animals, and the species changes. "Survival of the fittest" is still the rule, but the "fit" begin to look unlike what you might expect. And looks aren't the only things changing: behavior adapts too, from how hunted animals act to how they reproduce. There's nothing wrong with a species getting molded over time by new kinds of risk. But some experts believe problems arise when these changes make no evolutionary sense.

Ram Mountain in Alberta, Canada, is home to a population of bighorn sheep, whose most vulnerable individuals are males with thick, curving horns that give them a regal, Princess Leia look. In the course of 30 years of study, biologist Marco Festa-Bianchet of the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec found a roughly 25 percent decline in the size of these horns, and both male and female sheep getting smaller. There's no mystery on Ram Mountain: male sheep with big horns tend to be larger and produce larger offspring. During the fall rut, or breeding season, these alpha rams mate more than any other males, by winning fights or thwarting other males' access to their ewes. Their success, however, is contingent upon their surviving the two-month hunting season just before the rut, and in a strange way, they're competing against their horns. Around the age of 4, their horn size makes them legal gameâ€”several years before their reproductive peak. That means smaller-horned males get far more opportunity to mate.

Other species are shrinking, too. Australia's red kangaroo has become noticeably smaller as poachers target the largest animals for leather. The phenomenon has been most apparent in harvested fish: since fishing nets began capturing only fish of sufficient size in the 1980s, the Atlantic cod and salmon, several flounders and the northern pike have all propagated in miniature.

So what if fish or kangaroos are smaller? If being smaller is safer, this might be a successful adaptation for a hunted species. After all, " 'fitness' is relative and transitory," says Columbia University biologist Don Melnick, meaning that Darwinian natural selection has nothing to do with what's good or bad, or the way things should be. Tusks used to make elephants fitter, as a weapon or a tool in foragingâ€”until ivory became a precious commodity and having tusks got you killed. Then tuskless elephants, products of a genetic fluke, became the more consistent breeders and grew from around 2 percent among African elephants to more than 38 percent in one Zambian population, and 98 percent in a South African one. In Asia, where female elephants don't have tusks to begin with, the proportion of tuskless elephants has more than doubled, to more than 90 percent in Sri Lanka. But there's a cost to not having tusks. Tusked elephants, like the old dominant males on Ram Mountain, were "genetically 'better' individuals," says Festa-Bianchet. "When you take them systematically out of the population for several years, you end up leaving essentially a bunch of losers doing the breeding."

"Losers" tend not to be very good breeders, meaning that this demographic shift ultimately threatens the viability of a species. Researchers also worry that the surviving animals are left with a narrower gene pool. In highly controlled environments, a species with frighteningly little genetic diversity can persistâ€”think of the extremes of domesticated animals like thoroughbred horses or commercial chickensâ€”but in real ecosystems changes are unpredictable. Artificially selecting animals in the wildâ€”in effect, breeding themâ€”is "a very risky game," says Columbia's Melnick. "It's highly likely to result in the end of a species."

At present, researchers' alarm about these trends are based on theories that are hard to prove. To make scientific claims about the effects of hunting on the evolution of a species, researchers like Melnick would need thorough data from animal populations that lived at least several decades ago, which rarely exist. Evolution, it turns out, is a difficult beast to study in real time because it is the product of so many factorsâ€”changes in climate, habitat and food supply, as well as gene frequenciesâ€”and because it occurs so slowly. Researchers began tracking sheep on Ram Mountain in the early 1970s, corralling the entire population every year to make measurements and trace genealogies. "You cannot really just go out and take data and look for a trend," says Festa-Bianchet. "Even if you find a trend it can be due to environmental changes, to changes in density. You're really trying to tease out the genetic part of the change."

The time scale is one reason that most wildlife departments managing hunting harvests simply count the heads each year and decide how many to let hunters bag without thinking about genes. The most popular method of regulating huntingâ€”restricting legal game to males with a minimum antler sizeâ€”results in populations overrun with females and inferior males, which is ultimately no service to hunters. "The hunters wish for animals with large antlers and large horns, and yet their actions are making that harder to achieve," says Richard Harris, a conservation biologist in Montana. As a hunter, Harris knows that the outcome of this trend will satisfy no one, the Teddy Roosevelts of the next generation least of all.

Leadership needed to break coal's toxic grip
By LEE BRINSON

Is it apathy, ignorance or both that makes us mindlessly allow ourselves and our environment to be poisoned by coal? Is it that we are duped by the ads of the coal coalition and the politicians that support the coal and utility companies? Where is the outrage? What does the coal coalition stand to lose if real change takes place?

In 2007, the 48 companies that make up the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, made a combined profit of $57 billion ( Duke Energy, $1.5 billion, and Norfolk Southern, $1.46 billion, are two).

To protect their investments ACCCE spent $125 million in the first nine months of 2008, lobbying Congress to delay global warming pollution reduction until clean coal technology is ready, and $45 million trying to convince Americans that clean coal is the answer to our energy crisis.

The spokesman for ACCCE, Joe Lucas, admits it will be 10 to 15 years before carbon capture and storage will be available commercially. Ten to 15 years, when global scientists say we have no more than four or five years to make drastic changes with our energy policy to avoid the climate tipping point.

One of ACCCE's arguments is that coal is a clean, cheap source of energy. At every stage of coal development, it is neither clean nor cheap. Today, the preferred method of mining is mountain-top removal where an entire mountain top is removed by blasting. Once coal is removed from other materials by use of water and toxic chemicals, valleys are filled with the leftovers â€” toxic material in earthen dams with no liners.

Not only do these valley fills disrupt stream flow and pollute underground water, but in Kentucky in 2001, one of these earthen dams holding back 300 million gallons of toxic waste, failed. The EPA said it was the worst environmental disaster east of the Mississippi. Is this clean? Cheap?

Ash is a by-product of coal-fired power plants. In many cases, it is stored in ash pools behind unlined, earthen dams. On Dec. 22, 2008 the Kingston plant in Harriman, Tenn., failed, releasing over one billion gallons of toxic waste. That's three times the amount of the Kentucky disaster.

What toxic materials are in ash pools? Arsenic, mercury, and lead to name only three. Arsenic levels since the spill have been measured at 100 times the safe level for humans. Is this clean? Cheap?

Even though ash contains toxic material, it isn't classified as toxic.Therefore, it is free of virtually any regulation in ash pools. Duke Energy has 10 of these in North Carolina.

What harm do these toxins create? Mercury causes brain, kidney and lung damage. Arsenic causes vomiting, diarrhea, convulsions and death. Lead causes irreversible neurological damage and reproductive toxicity.

Duke Energy's Cliffside plant, being built in Rutherford County, is projected, among other pollutants, to release 400 pounds of mercury and 3 to 6 million tons of CO2 into the air annually. Another blow to our environment is that Cliffside is projected to use 20 million gallons of water daily. Is this clean? Cheap? Healthy?

What about recreational costs? Powellton Coal Co. is in the process of starting mountain-top removal of Gauley Mountain, West Va. Gauley Mountain sits astride the New River and the Gauley River gorge where 275,000 rafters annually enjoy the out of doors. Will their playground be spoiled?

If you would like to see what mountain-top removal leaves behind, go to Google Earth and zero in on West Virginia and surrounding states. One can easily see the destruction. Mining companies say they practice reclamation. You be the judge. Is this clean? Cheap?

U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry has consistently supported coal and gas over alternative energy. McHenry says he supports alternative energy; however.

In 2008, he opposed each major piece of legislation for alternative energy (H.R. 6899, H.R. 6049 and H.R. 5351).

Not only is coal not cheap or clean, it is the major contributor to global warming. We must move away from it with all deliberate speed. Political leadership is the first step along that path. Let's hope McHenry will vote on the right side of history.

Lee Brinson is a resident of Hickory.

Note: The N.C. Division of Air Quality has scheduled public hearings on a proposed air quality permit revision on Duke Energy's Cliffside Plant on Jan. 15 at 6 p.m. at Chase High School in Forest City and on Jan. 22 at 6 p..m. at Statesville High School in Statesville.

Here are the power plants in North Carolina with coal ash ponds as reported by The Associated Press:

Progress Energy Carolinas Inc., Buncombe County, 106,000 tons

Progress Energy, Chatham County, 101,300 tons

Progress Energy, Wayne County, 106,100 tons

Progress Energy, Person County, 46,300 tons

Progress Energy, New Hanover County, 166,000 tons

Progress Energy, Robeson County, 47,000 tons

Progress Energy, Person County, 212,800 tons

Duke Energy Corp., Gaston County, 143,400 tons

Duke Energy, Rowan County, 121,900 tons

Duke Energy, Cleveland County, 96,900 tons

Duke Energy, Rockingham County, 28,500 tons

Duke Energy , Catawba County, 33,500 tons

Duke Energy, Gaston County, 93,100 tons

Duke Energy, Stokes County, 41,400 tons

Paint it white

Global warming may seem like an overwhelmingly complex problem to tackle. But one scientist thinks the answer is brilliantly simple: all we need is white paint. A lot of white paint. David Adam reports

In California, flat-roofed premises are now required to have white roofs. Photograph: Alamy

Hashem Akbari has a vision of a shiny, happy world. He sees polished roads and cities that gleam in the sunlight. Rooftops are bright and pavements light. Akbari wants to turn our cities into a giant mirror and he needs your help. And paint, lots of it.

Akbari is no architect and his grand plan is no conceptual art project. Based at the prestigious Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, Akbari is a scientist who has come up with a new way to fight global warming. It could be the easiest solution you've never heard of.

His big idea is based on principles as old as the whitewashed villages that scatter the hills of southern Europe and North Africa. Turn enough of the world's black urban landscape white, he says, and it would reflect enough sunlight to delay global warming, and grant us some precious breathing space in the global struggle to control <http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/carbonemissions>carbon emissions.

Akbari is poised to launch a campaign to paint the world white. He wants dozens of the world's largest cities to unite in an effort to replace the dark-coloured materials used to cover roads and roofs with something a little more reflective.

It sounds simple, but the effect could be dramatic. Study after study has shown that buildings with white roofs stay cooler during the summer. The change reduces the way heat accumulates in built-up areas - known as the urban heat island effect - and allows people who live and work inside to switch off power-hungry air conditioning units.

Aware of the benefit, California has forced warehouses and other commercial premises with flat roofs to make them white since 2005, and, if such an effort could be extended, the results could make a big difference.

Together, roads and roofs are reckoned to cover more than half the available surfaces in urban areas, which have spread over some 2.4% of the Earth's land area. A mass movement to change their colour, Akbari calculates, would increase the amount of sunlight bounced off our planet by 0.03%. And, he says, that would cool the Earth enough to cancel out the warming caused by 44bn tonnes of CO2 pollution. If you think that sounds like a lot, then you're right. It would wipe out the expected rise in global emissions over the next decade. It won't solve the problem of <http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climatechange>climate change, Akbari says, but could be a simple and effective weapon to delay its impact - just so long as people start doing it in earnest. "Roofs are going to have to be changed one by one and to make that effort at a very local level, we need to have an organisation in place to make it happen," he says. Groups in several US cities, including Houston, Chicago and Salt Lake City, are on board with his plan, and he is talking to others.

The idea is a form of geo-engineering, a broad term used to cover all schemes that tackle the symptoms of climate change, namely catastrophic temperature rise, without addressing the root cause, our spiralling greenhouse gas emissions. And if altering all of the world's roofs and roads sounds extreme, then take a look at some ideas from the other end of the geo-engineering scale: giant mirrors in space, shiny balloons to float above the clouds and millions of fake plastic trees to suck carbon from the air. An increasing number of climate scientists argue that the world has little choice but to investigate such drastic options. Carbon emissions since 2000 have risen faster than anyone thought possible, mainly driven by the coal-fuelled boom in China, and a global temperature rise of 2-3C seems inevitable. Last year a special edition of a Royal Society journal dedicated to geo-engineering said the geo-engineering schemes "may be risky, but the time may well come when they are accepted as less risky than doing nothing".

Akbari says his plan is more workable than other geo-engineering ideas. The science is simple. Sunlight reflected from a surface does not contribute to the greenhouse effect, which drives global warming. That problem comes when dark surfaces soak up sunlight and send it back up as thermal energy, at just the right wavelength to rebound off CO2 in the sky.

The problem with shiny cities, according to Kevin Anderson of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at Manchester University, is more simple science. "It won't tackle global warming because carbon emissions are still rising," he says. Like all geo-engineering schemes, it will need to be kept up indefinitely, he says, and does not address the growing acidification of the oceans, caused as extra CO2 dissolves. The cooling effect and energy savings in cities would be welcome though, he adds.

Akbari says his idea is not intended to replace efforts to cut carbon emissions, but to work alongside them. "We can give the atmosphere time to breathe," he says. "I just don't see a downside to this idea. It benefits everybody and you don't have to have hard negotiations to make it happen."

Dark roofs reflect about 10-20% of sunlight, while white surfaces tend to send back at least half. In technical terms, the percentage of light reflected by a surface is called its albedo - so a perfectly reflective surface has an albedo of 1. Coloured paints have an albedo of 0.1-0.3, and white paints an albedo of 0.5-0.9. Asphalt road surfaces have albedos as low as 0.05, so they absorb up to 95% of the sun's energy. Concrete has an albedo of up to 0.3, tar and gravel just 0.1. Akbari's mission is to get individuals, local authorities, builders and communities to think about albedo alongside cost, colour and design when it comes to repairs, maintenance and new construction.

"This is not just a question of painting things white. Roofs and roads are routinely repaired and replaced and, when it comes to a householder changing their roof, we want them to look at reflective options. That's the time to target people." He says an "aggressive" programme could convert all cities within 10-20 years.

It is fairly easy to persuade, or require, the owners of buildings to select white materials for flat roofs, because the colour is only noticed by passing air travellers. But sloping roofs, found on most houses, are a different issue because they are visible from the ground. As pretty as snow-coated Alpine villages may look, skiers wear powerful sunglasses for a reason. Streets of white-roofed houses would dazzle in the sun. The same is true of road surfaces - too light a colour and too much light reflects as glare into the eyes of motorists.

No problem, Akbari says: reflective materials need not be white. Lighter colours such as grey are good too. And there are other ways to increase the albedo of materials. Pigments that bounce back infrared light can raise the reflectivity of dark surfaces by 40% without any obvious change in colour. They are not as effective as white, which bounces back visible wavelengths of light too, but they are much better than conventional materials.

The Public Works Research Institute in Japan has experimented with paints with such pigments applied to conventional asphalt surfaces. They made a road that reflects 86% of infrared light, which helps keep the surface cool, yet reflects just 23% of visible light, to keep down glare. The researchers were nervous that the extra infrared bouncing off the shiny road could cook pedestrians, but volunteers recruited in summertime to "stand on the paint-coated pavement and conventional pavement" said they actually preferred the painted version. This could be because the coated road kept their feet cool, the researchers said.

There are other benefits too. Computer simulations of Los Angeles show that resurfacing about two-thirds of roads and rooftops with reflective surfaces, as well as planting more trees, could cool the city by 2-3C. That would reduce LA smog as much as a total ban on cars and lorries, and cooler roofs could also save a fortune in electricity bills. On hot days in North America, up to 40% of all electricity can be consumed by air-conditioners, and each degree a city such as LA warms is reckoned to see the air-con turned up enough to need another 500MW - the output of a decent sized nuclear power station. Akbari estimates that widespread use of cooler rooftops could slash $1bn from electricity bills in the US alone.

That may be very well for places such as California, with its 300 days of sunshine a year, but what about gloomy northern Europe and the UK, with a measly 100 sunny days? The effect would not be as great, admits Surabi Menon, who works with Akbari at Lawrence Berkeley, but she says anywhere that needs air-conditioning, or has cities warmer than the outer rural areas would benefit. Akbari says his estimates of the global cooling potential of reflective cities are based on a global average, so the cloudier places will be made up for by the sunnier spots. "It's absolutely worth doing in the UK," he says. And, he adds, he might just have found a way to pay for it.

Each 10 sq m of urban surface changed from dark to white, he says, has the same cooling effect as preventing the release of a tonne of carbon dioxide. So why not include such resurfacing in carbon offset schemes? Just as money from green consumers and firms anxious about their carbon footprint is used to fund projects that plant trees, fit green lightbulbs and develop renewable energy, in exchange for carbon credits, so it could pay people across the world to paint, coat and resurface. At today's carbon prices, changing the colour of an average roof could net the householder £150, and Akbari's global scheme could together generate more than £500m. "We want to target 30 to 40 cities initially, but within a few years we hope it will mushroom around the world," he says. Go on, paint your town white.

> "Next Generation Biofuels": Bursting The New "Green" Bubble
> Letter challenges unrealistic promises from an unsustainable industry
> 
> United States--A diverse alliance of organizations published an open
> letter [1] today in the U.S. and internationally warning of the
> dangers of industrially produced biofuels (called agrofuels by
> critics). The letter explains why large-scale industrial production
> of transport fuels and other energy from plants such as corn, sugar
> cane, oilseeds, trees, grasses, or so-called agricultural and
> woodland waste threatens forests, biodiversity, food sovereignty,
> community-based land rights and will worsen climate change. With the
> new Obama Administration slated to take office Tuesday, the letter's
> originators warn that if Obama's "New Green Economy" runs on
> agrofuels it may trap the U.S. in a dangerous "Green Bubble" of
> unrealistic promises from an unsustainable industry.
> 
> Indications that the incoming Obama Administration may be
> ideologically wedded to continuing the agrofuel disaster are clear.
> President Obama's "New Green Deal" includes support for notoriously
> destructive agrofuel corporations, the creation of a pro-agribusiness
> cabinet that includes Tom Vilsack, Ken Salazar and Steven Chu,
> promotion of cellulosic fuel technologies, and references to
> increasing the Renewable Fuel Standard biofuel target. Additionally,
> Obama, a former Senator from a corn-growing state, has indicated that
> the already troubled U.S. ethanol industry will receive a financial
> boost soon, despite mounting evidence that the industry simply cannot
> meet the demand for fuel in any just or sustainable way.
> 
> "This no longer about corn ethanol-turning any plants into fuel is
> simply not renewable," stated Dr. Rachel Smolker, co-author of the
> letter and Global Justice Ecology Project agrofuels specialist. "All
> plants, edible or not, require soils, water, fertilizers and land,
> all of which are in shortening supply. Yet these unsustainable
> technologies are commanding the vast majority of renewable energy tax
> incentives, at the expense of genuine cleaner energy solutions like
> conservation, efficiency, wind, solar, and ocean power. Additionally,
> because agrofuel crops rely on fertilizers, 44% of which are
> imported, they cannot even satisfy the calls for U.S. energy independence."
> 
> Corn and sugar based agrofuels have already come under extreme
> scrutiny due to their documented contribution to the food crisis,
> with venture capital investment in these so-called 'first generation
> biofuels' dropping to zero. The open letter exposes the further
> problems that will result from the so-called 'second generation' of
> agrofuels. These problems range from wholesale destruction of the
> world's rainforests and other sensitive forests, to the forced
> displacement of entire communities to make way for agrofuel
> expansion, and the biosafety risks of gambling on novel technologies
> like Synthetic Biology and genetically engineered trees. The letter
> also makes clear that agrofuels made from inedible plant feedstocks
> (cellulosic fuels) will continue to exacerbate the food crisis by
> monopolizing additional agricultural lands for the growing of
> agrofuel crops such as grasses and trees, instead of food crops.
> 
> The groups originating the letter have called on others to join them
> in preventing another ill-conceived push into agrofuels similar to
> that which last year raised food prices and hunger levels to crisis
> proportions. "The last administration's enthusiastic foray into
> biofuels exacerbated global environmental destruction, land theft and
> hunger in just a very short space of time," explains Kathy Jo Wetter
> of the ETC Group. "Redoubling that biofuels push is a continuation of
> disastrous policies rather than the change we need."

USDA APPROVES FIRST EVER GUARANTEED LOAN FOR COMMERCIAL-SCALE CELLULOSIC ETHANOL PLANT
Funding for Wood-chip Plant Paves Way for Next Generation of Biofuels

WASHINGTON -- Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer announced today that USDA Rural Development has approved the first ever loan guarantee to a commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol plant. The $80 million loan to Range Fuels Inc., Soperton, Ga., comes from the Section 9003 Biorefinery Assistance Program authorized by the 2008 Farm Bill.

"The investment in this facility -- which will make cellulosic ethanol from wood chips -- has the potential to significantly advance the timetable for second generation ethanol production in this country," Schafer said. "I visited the pilot plant last October and was excited to see how well the technology works. The funding announced today helps the Bush administration fulfill its commitment to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil by developing alternative, renewable energy sources. USDA is proud to work with the private sector to lead this important breakthrough in renewable energy production."

The Biorefinery Assistance Program promotes the development of new and emerging technologies for the production of advanced biofuels -- defined as fuels that are not produced from food sources. The program provides loan guarantees to develop, construct and retrofit viable commercial-scale biorefineries producing advanced biofuels. The maximum loan guarantee is $250 million per project. The program is designed to create energy-related jobs and economic development in rural America. The loan to Range Fuels is approved subject to conditions.

The project is expected to produce an estimated 63 jobs. When fully operational in 2010, the plant is expected to produce approximately 20 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol per year.

USDA Rural Development's mission is to increase economic opportunity and improve the quality of life for rural residents. Rural Development has invested more than $111 billion since 2001 for equity and technical assistance to finance and foster growth in homeownership, business development, and critical community and technology infrastructure. More than 2 million jobs have been created or saved through these investments. Further information on rural programs is available at a local USDA Rural Development office or by visiting USDA Rural Development's web site at <http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/>http://www.rurdev.usda.gov.

Battle lines are drawn on beach over sandbags

Towns join push to relax state ban

North Carolina's push to get long-standing sandbags off its beachfront took a hit last week when a New Hanover County judge ruled that The Riggings could keep the bags that have protected the Kure Beach condominium complex for 23 years.

<http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20090116/ARTICLES/901160312/1118/NEWS01?Title=Battle_lines_are_drawn_on_beach_over_sandbags#><http://www.starnewsonline.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=WM&Date=20090116&Category=ARTICLES&ArtNo=901160312&Ref=AR&MaxW=250&border=0>

But a much bigger challenge to the state's policy against hardened structures along the coast could be brewing - and not just because the Riggings ruling might be unique to that situation.

When the General Assembly reconvenes in Raleigh Jan. 28, supporters of a plan to allow beach communities to build terminal groins near unstable inlets are promising a renewed push.

The idea isn't new. It was first floated two years ago. But it never garnered enough support from both chambers of the legislature to gain any traction in the face of opposition by then-Gov. Mike Easley.

This year, however, things could be different.

Proponents have broadened the bills' backers beyond Figure Eight Island to remove the stigma of a rich, private island looking to protect million-dollar homes.

Now, towns from the Outer Banks to Brunswick County intend to press their representatives to get the state's ban softened to make exceptions for erosion around the volatile inlets.

Their argument goes something like this: The state's long-standing ban on sea walls and jetties shouldn't be changed. But inlets are special situations that require special tools to protect people and property, since traditional options such as beach nourishment have proven ineffective.

That preferred solution would be a terminal groin - a low-slung wall adjacent to an inlet that would trap enough sand to stabilize the immediate beach area. Eventually it would be buried and let excess sand by.

"This is not like other structures people are worried about," said Caswell Beach Mayor Harry Simmons, who also is the executive director of the N.C. Beach, Inlet and Waterway Association.

"This is a sediment-management tool, not an armoring device. And since we already have a different set of rules for building around inlets, why don't we have a different set of tools in our toolbox to deal with erosion there?"

But Jim Stephenson, coastal policy analyst with the N.C. Coastal Federation, said the only thing that's changed this time around is the amount of money the bill's proponents have to lobby legislators.

He said the state is already moving to expand its inlet-hazard areas to allow them to include all areas influenced by the volatile channels so that future development doesn't face the same problems current homes do.

But he maintains that hardened structures simply move the erosion problem to someplace else along the beachfront.

He also hinted that the federation may appeal the ruling allowing The Riggings to keep its sandbags if state regulators decide not to.

But even Judge Jay Hockenbury said his ruling might be specific to The Riggings and not very applicable to the roughly 150 other sandbag structures along the coast that state regulators have said need to come out.

The condos are squeezed between federally protected coquina rock and a state-built rock revetment, effectively starving The Riggings of sand and a stable beach.

Senators seek stimulus funds for nuclear cleanup



Monday, January 19, 2009 11:43 AM PST

By Shannon Dininny
The Associated Press

RICHLAND, Wash. â€” Miles of tainted groundwater. Dozens of burial sites, silently brimming with dangerous radioactive waste. Weapons-grade plutonium still to be shipped off the nationâ€™s most contaminated nuclear site.

The Hanford nuclear reservation in southeast Washington presents no shortage of work toward cleaning up the site, work that is expected to continue for decades, but managers say they will miss 23 deadlines this year because budgeted funds were insufficient

Thatâ€™s one reason senators whose districts include Department of Energy sites like Hanford are pushing for stimulus money to rejuvenate local economies with cleanup work and, they hope, provide freshly-scrubbed land for industrial development.

â€œThis is exactly the kind of thing a stimulus package should be composed of,â€ said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho.

Spending more and completing cleanups faster would enable the government to decrease the â€œfootprintâ€ or overall size of each site, releasing more property for development, according to an Energy Department proposal for the stimulus package.

The 586-square-mile Hanford reservation is one of dozens of sites created nationwide to build the first atomic bombs during World War II and nuclear weapons during the Cold War. Other major sites are in Kentucky, Tennessee, South Carolina, New Mexico, Nevada, Idaho and other states.

Cleanup at the Idaho National Laboratory, unlike many other sites, is generally on schedule and in some areas ahead of schedule. Crapo said he doesnâ€™t generally support stimulus packages, and heâ€™s not certain heâ€™ll support the bill when it goes to a Senate vote, but he still signed the letter seeking more nuclear cleanup funds.

â€œIf we had an entire stimulus package that had these kinds of worthy projects in it, it would be a lot easier to justify a yes vote,â€ Crapo said.

Others signing the letter include Sens. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.; Ron Wyden, D-Ore.; Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.; Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Jim Risch, R-Idaho, and Tom Udall, D-N.M.

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., also supports boosting cleanup spending nationally by $6 billion.

The federal government retains ownership of the properties, most of them highly contaminated and often near major waterways, threatening public health and the environment. Since the mid-1990s, the Energy Department has spent $7.3 billion to $5.5 billion on environmental cleanup nationally each year.

The longer the cleanup drags on, the more technically challenging and expensive it gets, said Susan Gordon, director of the Alliance for Nuclear Accountability in Washington D.C.

â€œIf weâ€™re supposed to do big public works projects, environmental cleanup seems to me would fit right into that,â€ she said. â€œAll of the sites are Superfund sites, so theyâ€™re supposed to be cleaned up.â€

Most also are governed under cleanup compacts with regulators, generally either the Environmental Protection Agency, state agencies or both, but many deadlines are being missed.

Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire sued the federal government last month for failing to meet deadlines in the Hanford compact.

At Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in northern California, EPA fined the Energy Department $105,000 for failing to clean up groundwater contaminated by hazardous chemicals, plus $10,000 a week until the department resumes the effort.

â€œIn most cases, these violations result from a lack of adequate funding, causing milestones to be missed, cleanup schedules to be delayed and commitments to local communities, regulators and states to fall by the wayside,â€ several senators wrote in a letter to leaders on the appropriations committee.

A House stimulus bill released last week includes $500 million for such cleanup. Senators in states with significant cleanup responsibilities are pushing for $6 billion over four years, $1.5 billion a year.

Hanford, where overall cleanup costs are expected to top $50 billion, gets about $2 billion of the Energy Departmentâ€™s total cleanup budget annually.

Some work could be accelerated with additional money, said David Brockman, manager of the agencyâ€™s Richland operations office, which oversees half of the Hanford cleanup. He cited work to pump-and-treat contaminated groundwater, cleanup of two aging pools that once contained spent nuclear fuel and efforts to retrieve highly radioactive waste from the siteâ€™s central plateau.

Cleanup of the plateau, which holds some of the most dangerous waste, has slowed because it is farther from Columbia River, the principal waterway in the Pacific Northwest.

â€œWe could put more money to really good work,â€ Brockman said. â€œWeâ€™re ready to roll. Weâ€™d just have to hire the people.â€

Coal-tar sealants erode and create dust that can contain high levels of PAHs.






Parking lots treated with coal-tar-based sealcoats are a major source of cancer-causing contaminants that can pollute air, soil, water and wildlife, posing a significant health risk to humans who may breathe, drink or eat them in fish and other food.








Context

Parking lots and other paved areas are sometimes sealed to protect them from the elements. Two main sealants are used in the US: asphalt (crude oil base) and coal-tar base. Asphalt is more common in western states, while coal-tar base is the dominant form used in eastern and central states.

<http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-coal-tar.htm>Coal-tar is formed when coal is coked, a process to prepare coal for use as a fuel.  Coal-tar base sealants contain high levels of a class of chemicals known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). A mix of different types of PAHs are found in the sealant.

The long-lived PAHs widely pollute the environment, wildlife and people. These highly dangerous chemicals are expected to cause cancer in people.

PAHs form if oil, coal, wood and petroleum do not burn completely. Sources include vehicles, factories, power plants and pavement sealcoats. Of the many sources of PAHs in the environment, it is not known how much of it comes from sealcoated pavements.

As the black, shiny sealcoats wear away over time, small, dusty particles form. The specks can contain PAHs and other chemicals found in the sealants.

Wind and water disperse the particles into the surrounding environment. Wind carries the contaminated dust almost everywhere -- into the water, onto other pavements or onto land used for gardens or crops. Potentially, the dust, if very fine, could be breathed in by animals and people.

The dust is also washed off the surfaces into local lakes, streams and other waterways by rain and snow melt. The stormwater runoff can contain high levels of PAHs. Some researchers suggest that coal-tar based sealcoats are a major source of PAH pollution in streams. Often, high levels of PAHs are found in the sediments of the lakes and streams accepting the stormwater runoff.

This pollution poses an environmental health risk for the organisms that live in the waterways, including fish that may be eaten by humans. A study of sealcoats in runoff in Austin, Texas, has linked adverse effects in local amphibians to sealcoat dust runoff (<http://www.environmentalhealthnews.org/ehs/newscience/coal-tar-sealcoats-release-pahs/#bryer>Bryer et al. 2006).

What did they do?

The authors studied paving in nine US cities, choosing the cities because of their proximity to lakes and their regional location in the western (Seattle, WA; Portland, OR; Salt Lake City, UT), eastern (New Haven, CT; Washington, DC) and central (Minneapolis, MN; Chicago, IL; Detroit, MI; Austin, TX) parts of the country. The pave study sites within each city were not near industry and represented different uses, such as home driveways, schools, office parks and retail businesses. Dust was also gathered from adjacent roads and soils.

The samples were collected, sieved and analyzed for total PAHs. Depending on the comparisons made, data were either combined -- to examine PAHs in dust from surfaces with or surfaces without sealants -- or analyzed individually -- to determine site-to-site variability. The researchers compared PAH levels in the dust samples: 1) among different US cities, 2) between the nonsealcoated and sealcoated  pavements, 3) between the two major types of sealcoatings and 4) with levels in nearby lake sediments as measured by other studies.


What did they find?

The amount of PAHs in the dust samples reflected whether the pavement was unsealed or sealed. Very low levels of PAHs were found in all unsealed pavements.

However, the level of PAHs in dust on sealed pavements depended on which sealant was used. Surfaces sealed with an asphalt-based product contained low PAH levels, similar to those of unsealed pavements.

In sharp contrast, samples from coated pavements in the east and central US  had mean total PAH levels up to 80 times higher than those from unsealed lots. In the six central and eastern cities, where coal-tar based products dominate, the average levels of total PAHs were 2,200 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg). Samples from uncoated pavements from the same cities were just 27 mg/kg. The sealcoated samples also had large variablity -- an order of magnitude -- among sites,  with levels ranging from 345 to 3,400 mg/kg.

Samples from both coated and uncoated sites in cities in western states had low levels of PAHs. All but one were less than 13 mg/kg, which is 1,000 times lower than levels found in the eastern and central sites. One of the nine coated lots was sealed with a coal-tar base product and had PAH levels of 850 mg/kg. These data highlight the predominant use of asphalt base rather than coal-tar base sealants.

Samples of soil and dust collected from areas close to sealcoated lots had elevated levels of PAHs, from 2 to 39 times higher than samples obtained near unsealcoated lots. A similar trend was seen between PAH levels in local lake sediments near sealed lots.

Two residential homes in suburban Chicago had the highest levels of PAHs at 5,800 and 9,600 mg/kg.

What does it mean?

In general, the amount of PAHs in dust samples  clearly differed among regions. Eastern and central cities had higher levels of PAHs than the study sites in western states. This held for PAH levels in the dust from the paved areas, in the samples from nearby streets/soil and from records of lake sediments.

These differences reflect the type of sealant predominantly used in different areas of the country. Some of the contamination found in eastern and central cities was chemically traced to coal-tar based sealcoats. Also, the difference between eastern and western samples in PAH levels -- reported as a ratio of 1,000 to 1 -- mimics the total PAH concentrations found in the coal-tar base and the asphalt base products, respectively.

This study adds more informtion about regional and national PAH pollution from coal-tar sealants. It also highlights the potential human health risk from coal-tar based products and shows a need to better understand and reduce use and impacts.

Coal-tar based sealcoats contain very high levels of PAHs -- up to 30 percent by weight. PAHs are known to cause an array of health effects and pose a significant threat to wildlife and humans.

Sealcoats are not stable. The coatings break down over time, forming dust that moves the PAHs from the paved surfaces to surrounding areas, including soil, water and air.

Of particular concern are the levels found in residential driveways. PAH levels in the collected dust were above toxic guideline limits for indoor dust and soils. Potentially, the outside dust could pose a human health risk either directly, by someone touching the surface, or indirectly through objects that contact the surface, such as shoes or basketballs.

Hand to mouth contact is a major route of exposure for infants, children and adults. People can ingest contaminant-laden house dust by touching it then eating without washing their hands. Mouthing toys and other objects is another way babies are exposed (<http://www.environmentalhealthnews.org/ehs/newscience/coal-tar-sealcoats-release-pahs/#stapleton>Stapleton et al. 2008).

Outdoor, PAH-laden dust could also be ingested by hand to mouth contact. The dust could be picked up on hands or carried indoors on the bottom of shoes. It could also be breathed in while working or playing outside (driveways, playgrounds, etc.).

PAHs in the lake sediments and surrounding soils is also a concern for wildlife and people. Humans could eat contaminated fish or agriculural crops grown on soils polluted with PAHs.

Clearly, the high levels of PAHs observed in these urban and suburban areas warrant further research as to the health risk of these common and widely used sealing products. 

Coal-tar sealants are <http://www.danewaters.com/business/coalTar.aspx>banned from use in some places. One simple solution is use asphalt containing sealcoats, particularly for residential use and playgrounds.

Change won't happen unless the money works out.  That is part of capitalism, which is much maligned, but not inherently evil.  Greed may, indeed, be to the greater good.   

The most innovative feat will be the shift to solar powered batteries that can power homes and cars.  There is free energy available and the reason it has not been served to the general public is that there is not an obvious revenue stream attached.  Also, that a lack of creativity has ham-strung the economic systems that keep us locked into existing work ecologies that are in great need of major overhauls.

Manufacturers assume that once you own solar technology, you will no longer need as much energy from the existing power grid and from gas.  While this is true, servicing the equipment and making the transition equipment and outfitting new systems will fill part of that revenue stream void.  Also, new needs will emerge from the use of the new technology.  No one had a clue that cars would completely revolutionize American culture and economics.  The shift to solar/battery energy sources will have the same this time intended consequence.

One of these would be a shift in driving patterns that would make people rely on their own battery powered cars for local and commuting needs and on other means of transportation for longer trips.  This could mean a huge number of people who do not rent now suddenly choosing to rent larger vehicles for such trips.  Car makers would still make cars, but they would no longer be tied to gas economies.  The new rentable luxury travel vehicles would be funded and maintained by short-term leases and designed for recycling after a certain period of use.  Overhauling and maintaining the communal fleet would keep many jobs in the system while keeping a lot of rusting, outdated metal out of landfills.  This would also open up a new but currently marginally tapped revenue stream.

Another would be building on the existing national rail system to make it more available between smaller communities and within communities.  Before people all had their own multiple cars, people travelled by train.  It was exciting and affordable.  They would find it exciting and affordable again if train stations were re-opened or built and train cars were comfortable and managed as a luxury service that could accommodate families safely and conveniently.  Travelling to large cities with my husband and son in a private car, even if it were small, would be magically different and exciting over the standard rugged individual road trip.  Currently that means the extra expense and inconvenience of  hotels, moving all of your things every two days, the child cramped in the back seat in a harness, bored and hating it.  He could instead be looking out the window or possibly being babysat in a day-care car, with bonded, professional and monitored paid attendants and other children to play with on a three hour trip, an internal revenue stream which would also again include food services (McDonald's Rail Car!).  I would certainly love that over flying, which is just a harnessed child in the air.  And trains also can be run on alternative fuels.  Trains have possibilities that cars do not, including a new possible revenue stream.

Car companies could convert and move to new transportation venues.  They can make the new loco-vore equivalent cars.  And they could manage, maintain, and innovate the rail system between and inside cities. A renewal of interest and building on our culture with a new eye to keeping us connected instead of isolated in little boxes, whether that means track housing or personal automobiles, would revitalize the idea of community by having us all using the same materials to have a better life, each only taking as they need rather than hoarding for when they want.  

But solar innovation has another hidden advantage that would be the most crucial in social innovation.  Solar is nothing for countries to kill each other's children over.  We all get our share every 12 hours or so.  This would be the biggest innovation of all.

> PLANTING TREES AND MANAGING SOILS TO SEQUESTER CARBON

     by Lester R. Brown
> 
> 
> Although banning deforestation may seem farfetched, environmental reasons have pushed three countries - Thailand, the Philippines, and China - to implement complete or partial bans on logging. All three bans were imposed following devastating floods and mudslides resulting from the loss of forest cover. After suffering record losses from several weeks of nonstop flooding in the Yangtze River basin, Beijing noted that when forest policy was viewed not through the eyes of the individual logger but through those of society as a whole, it simply did not make economic sense to continue deforesting. The flood control service of trees standing, they said, was three times as valuable as the timber from trees cut. With this in mind, Beijing then took the unusual step of paying the loggers to become tree plantersto reforest instead of deforest.
> 
> Other countries cutting down large areas of trees will also face the environmental effects of deforestation, including flooding. If Brazils Amazon rainforest continues to shrink, it may also continue to dry out, becoming vulnerable to fire. If the Amazon rainforest disappears, it would be replaced largely by desert and scrub forestland. The capacity of the rainforest to cycle water to the interior, including to the agricultural areas to the south, would be lost. At this point, a fast-unfolding local environmental calamity would become an economic disaster, and because the burning Amazon would release billions of tons of carbon into the atmosphere, it would accelerate global warming.
> 
> Just as national concerns about the effects of continuing deforestation eventually eclipsed local interests, now global interests are beginning to eclipse national ones as deforestation has become a major driver of global warming. Deforestation is no longer just a matter of local flooding, but also rising seas worldwide and the many other effects of climate change. Nature has just raised the ante on protecting forests.
> 
> Reaching a goal of zero net deforestation will require reducing the pressures to deforest that come from population growth, rising affluence, the construction of ethanol distilleries and biodiesel refineries, and the fast-growing use of paper. Protecting the earth's forests means halting population growth as soon as possible, and, for the earth's affluent residents who are responsible for the growing demand for beef and soybeans that is deforesting the Amazon basin, it means moving down the food chain. A successful deforestation ban may require a ban on the construction of additional biodiesel refineries and ethanol distilleries.
> 
> Against this backdrop of growing concern about the forest-climate relationship, a leading Swedish energy firm, Vattenfall, has examined the large-scale potential for foresting wasteland to sequester carbon dioxide. They begin by noting that there are 1.86 billion hectares of degraded land in the world - land that was once forestland, cropland, or grasslandand that half of this, or 930 million hectares, has a decent chance of being profitably reclaimed. Some 840 million hectares of this total are in the tropical regions, where reclamation would mean much higher rates of carbon sequestration.
> 
> Vattenfall estimates that the maximum technical potential of these 930 million hectares is to absorb roughly 21.6 billion tons of CO2 per year. If, as part of a global climate stabilization strategy, carbon sequestration were valued at $210 per ton of carbon, the company believes that 18 percent of this technical potential could be realized. If so, this would mean planting 171 million hectares of land to trees. This arealarger than that planted to grain in Indiawould sequester 3.5 billion tons of CO2 per year, or over 950 million tons of carbon. The total cost of sequestering carbon at $210 per ton would be $200 billion. Spread over a decade, this would mean investing $20 billion a year to give climate stabilization a large and potentially decisive boost. This global forestation plan to remove atmospheric CO2, most of it put there by industrial countries, would be funded by them. An independent body would be set up to administer, fund, and monitor the vast tree planting initiative.
> 
> Aside from the Vattenfall forestation idea, there are already many tree planting initiatives under way that are driven by a range of concerns, from climate change to desert expansion, to soil conservation, to making cities more habitable.  In late 2006, the U.N. Environment Programme, inspired by Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai, announced plans for a worldwide effort to plant 1 billion trees in one year to fight climate change. This initial target was easily exceeded and by mid-2008, more than 2 billion trees had been planted in more than 150 countries. The new goal is to have 7 billion trees planted by the end of 2009 just over one tree for every person on the planet.
> 
> A number of agricultural practices can also increase the carbon stored as organic matter in soils. Farming practices that reduce soil erosion and raise cropland productivity usually also lead to higher carbon content in the soil. Among these are shifting from conventional tillage to minimum-till and no-till, the more extensive use of cover crops, the return of all livestock and poultry manure to the land, expansion of irrigated area, a return to more mixed crop-livestock farming, and the forestation of marginal farmlands.
> 
> Rattan Lal, a Senior Agronomist with the Carbon Management and Sequestration Center at Ohio State University, has calculated the range of potential carbon sequestration for each of many practices, such as those just cited. For example, expanding the use of cover crops to protect soil during the off-season can store from 68 million to 338 million tons of carbon worldwide each year. Calculating the total carbon sequestration for the practices he cites shows a potential for sequestering 400 million tons of carbon each year at the low end, and 1.2 billion tons of carbon per year at the more optimistic high end. For our carbon budget we are assuming, perhaps conservatively, that 600 million tons of carbon can be sequestered as a result of adopting these carbon-sensitive farming and land management practices.
> 
> Ending net deforestation and sequestering carbon as described above will put us on the path to the Plan B climate stabilization goal of cutting net carbon emissions 80 percent by 2020. To see how raising energy efficiency and harnessing renewable sources of energy complete the picture, see Earth Policy Institute's <http://www.earthpolicy.org/Books/PB3/80by2020.htm>carbon cutting blueprint.

Losing Harvard's Billions

By edward.epstein
Created 01/27/2009 - 4:18pm
Harvard Management Co., which runs the world's largest endowment fund, has had until recently an incredible record. Over the past six years, it succeeded in more than doubling the notional value of Harvard's endowment to $36.9 billion in fiscal 2008 (which ended on June 30) even after paying for about one-third of Harvard's operating expenses. So its recent loss of $8.1 billion from July 1 to Oct. 31, 2008, came as a stunning blow. Yet this huge loss, as staggering as it sounds, might be only the tip of the iceberg of illiquid investments. According to a source close to the <http://www.hmc.harvard.edu/>Harvard Management Co. [1], the damage, if the fund's illiquid investments are realistically appraised, may be closer to $18 billionâ€”or more than twice the amount previously reported. (This is in line with a <http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aq1MhEC7B6R8&refer=home>report [2], released today, showing an average 22.5 percent drop in endowments in North America.)

The lack of clarity says a lot about how exotic Harvard's finances have become. Its team of highly incentivized money managersâ€”who themselves earned $26.8 million in 2008â€”adopted a strategy aimed at taking maximum advantage of an inflationary global boom in the early 2000s by shifting the lion's share of Harvard's money from conventional endowment assetsâ€”such as bonds, preferred stocks, Treasury bills, and cashâ€”into more esoteric investments that would presumably rise as more money chased after scarcer goods. They bought, for example, oil in storage tanks, timber forests, and farmlands. As the proliferation of trillions of dollars worth of subprime mortgages further expanded the bubble, driving up the price of oil, lumber, and land, the notional value of Harvard's portfolio soared.

The price of oil, for example, which Harvard and other speculators were storing, more than quadrupled to $153 a barrel on commodity exchanges, allowing Harvard to hugely appreciate the notional value of its portfolio. So between fiscal 2003 and 2008, Harvard's "real assets" showed a gain of nearly 25 percent annually. But even after the subprime mortgage crisis began to unfold and a number of financial institutions had collapsed, Harvard's money managers persisted in pursuing this risky course.

Consequently, as late as June 2008, the fund kept almost no reserve of cash or Treasury bills and allocated a mere 6 percent of its money to fixed-interest bonds. It also borrowed more than $1 billion to amplify the returns on its less conventional investments. So by the time the bubble burst in the fall of 2008, only a small fraction of the endowment fund investment was even under the jurisdiction of the SEC. According to the November 7th <http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1082621/0001193125-08-233901.txt>13F holding report it filed with the SEC [3] for the quarter ending September 30th, 2008, Harvard had only $2.88 billion of its funds in exchange-listed stocks, options, or other derivatives. What of the more than $35 billion it had allocated to investments at the start of fiscal 2009 (i.e., July 2008)? Most of the balance had been allocated to investments, which if not totally illiquid could not be valued by market activity. The breakdown that follows illuminates how far HMC had strayed from the path of traditional endowment investing in the last decade.

More than one-quarter of Harvard's funds were still sunk in "real assets": about 8 percent in stockpiled oil, about 9 percent in timber and other agricultural land, and 9 percent in real estate participation. Then came the financial crises, and prices plunged. Oil fell to less than $40 a barrel. Lumber suffered almost as badly. And, with the drying up of bank lending, the value of Harvard's real estate holdingsâ€”which remain opaqueâ€”became at best problematic. One indication of how steep the loss may be is that CalPERS, the giant pension fund of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which owned even more real estate acreage than Harvard, reported in this period a 103 percent loss on real estate deals in which, like Harvard, it had borrowed to amplify its profits.

Another huge portion of Harvard's endowment had been farmed out to hedge funds (18 percent) and private equity funds (13 percent). While these funds provided some diversification, many of them also impose restrictions on withdrawals, including ones, like Citadel, that suffered substantial losses. To get back its money under such circumstance, it was often necessary to sell at a steep discount to a "secondary" hedge fund. One major player in the private equity business tells me that Harvard had tried this fall to sell its private equity stakes at 30 percent to 35 percent discounts but could find no buyers even at those prices. It's also possible that Harvard will have to meet "capital calls" on its private equity investments that would sap even more capital.

Harvard also allocated nearly $4 billion, or 11 percent of its fund, to volatile emerging markets, such as Brazil, Mexico, and Russia. Here its money managers bet both that the stocks would go up and that the local currencies would at least hold steady against the dollar, but they lost on both counts. First, the thin local stock markets, which had little liquidity, collapsed in the financial crises. For example, Russian stocks lost almost 80 percent of their value in a matter of days last fall. Then, as banks and hedge funds got out of their currency trades, the local currencies in many of these countries also lost heavily against the dollar. The Brazilian real, for example, fell about 40 percent last year. So presumably the endowment fund took a double hit. Aside from emerging markets, Harvard had invested another 11 percent if its portfolio in more established foreign economies, as those of Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Australia, and Japan. But here the stock markets declined and, with the exception of the Japanese yen, so did their currencies.

Given the true cost of getting its money out of the hedge funds and other illiquid investments, my knowledgeable source finds the claim by Harvard's money managers that the fund lost only 22 percent at best "purely Pollyannaish." (A Harvard University press representative declined to comment for this story.) But while Harvard's money managers may chose to look through rose-colored glasses at the value of their portfolio, Harvard University, which relies on the interest from distribution from its endowment to fund one-third of its operating budget, needs to be more realistic. As its president, Drew Faust, noted in an e-mail to the Harvard community, "We need to be prepared to absorb unprecedented endowment losses and plan for a period of greater financial constraint."

Harvard is hardly alone in moving from traditional investments to more exotic instruments. Yale's endowment fund, which with $22.5 billion in assets in 2008 was second only to Harvard's, followed a similar strategy of finding alternate investments including hedge funds, private equity funds, physical commodities, and emerging markets. Its longtime manager, David Swensen, indeed makes the argument in his book Pioneering Portfolio Management that diversifications of this kind are safer than just investing in traditional stocks and bonds. And during the decade preceding the present financial crises, his fund actually outperformed Harvard's. But despite his efforts at diversification, Yale lost at least 25 percent of its fund in the fall of 2008 if one takes into account the plunging value of its illiquid assets. Columbia University, too, is seeing losses.

So institutions of higher education, like other speculators seeking enormous profits in what is essentially a zero-sum game, learned the sad lesson that playing for high stakes in the casino economy inexorably entailed the risk of catastrophic losses.

Leaves are falling off trees in the height of summer, railway tracks are buckling, and people are retiring to their beds with deep-frozen hot-water bottles, as much of Australia swelters in its worst-ever heatwave.


On Friday, Melbourne thermometers topped 43C (109.4F) on a third successive day for the first time on record, while even normally mild Tasmania suffered its second-hottest day in a row, as temperatures reached 42.2C. Two days before, Adelaide hit a staggering 45.6C. After a weekend respite, more records are expected to be broken this week.

Ministers are blaming the heat â€“ which follows a record drought â€“ on global warming. Experts worry that Australia, which emits more carbon dioxide per head than any nation on earth, may also be the first to implode under the impact of climate change.

At times last week it seemed as if that was happening already. Chaos ruled in Melbourne on Friday after an electricity substation exploded, shutting down the city's entire train service, trapping people in lifts, and blocking roads as traffic lights failed. Half a million homes and businesses were blacked out, and patients were turned away from hospitals.

More than 20 people have died from the heat, mainly in Adelaide. Trees in Melbourne's parks are dropping leaves to survive, and residents at one of the city's nursing homes have started putting their clothes in the freezer.

"All of this is consistent with climate change, and with what scientists told us would happen," said climate change minister Penny Wong.

Australia, the driest inhabited continent on earth, is regarded as highly vulnerable. A study by the country's blue-chip Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation identified its ecosystems as "potentially the most fragile" on earth in the face of the threat.

Many factors put Australia especially at risk. Its climate is already hot, dry and variable. Its vulnerable agriculture plays an unusually important part in the economy. And most people and industry are concentrated on the coast, making it vulnerable to the rising seas and ferocious storms that come with a warmer world.

Most of the south of the country is gripped by unprecedented 12-year drought. The Australian Alps have had their driest three years ever, and the water from the vast Murray-Darling river system now fails to reach the sea 40 per cent of the time. Harvests have fallen sharply.

It will get worse as global warming increases. Even modest temperature rises, now seen as unavoidable, are expected to increase drought by 70 per cent in New South Wales, cut Melbourne's water supplies by more than a third, and dry up the Murray-Darling system by another 25 per cent.

As Professor David Karoly, of the University of Melbourne, said last week: "The heat is unusual, but it will become much more like the normal experience in 10 to 20 years."

> Losses are great, and continuous, says the report

> The global economy is losing more money from the disappearance of forests than through the current banking crisis, according to an EU-commissioned study.

> It puts the annual cost of forest loss at between $2 trillion and $5 trillion.

> The figure comes from adding the value of the various services that forests perform, such as providing clean water and absorbing carbon dioxide.

> The study, headed by a Deutsche Bank economist, parallels the Stern Review into the economics of climate change.

> It has been discussed during many sessions here at the World Conservation Congress.

> Some conservationists see it as a new way of persuading policymakers to fund nature protection rather than allowing the decline in ecosystems and species, highlighted in the release on Monday of the Red List of Threatened Species, to continue.

> Capital losses

> Speaking to BBC News on the fringes of the congress, study leader Pavan Sukhdev emphasised that the cost of natural decline dwarfs losses on the financial markets.

> "It's not only greater but it's also continuous, it's been happening every year, year after year," he told BBC News.

> Teeb will... show the risks we run by not valuing [nature] adequately."

> Andrew Mitchell
> Global Canopy Programme

> "So whereas Wall Street by various calculations has to date lost, within the financial sector, $1-$1.5 trillion, the reality is that at today's rate we are losing natural capital at least between $2-$5 trillion every year."

> The review that Mr Sukhdev leads, The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (Teeb), was initiated by Germany under its recent EU presidency, with the European Commission providing funding.

> The first phase concluded in May when the team released its finding that forest decline could be costing about 7% of global GDP. The second phase will expand the scope to other natural systems.

> Stern message

> Key to understanding his conclusions is that as forests decline, nature stops providing services which it used to provide essentially for free.

> So the human economy either has to provide them instead, perhaps through building reservoirs, building facilities to sequester carbon dioxide, or farming foods that were once naturally available.

> Or we have to do without them; either way, there is a financial cost.

> The Teeb calculations show that the cost falls disproportionately on the poor, because a greater part of their livelihood depends directly on the forest, especially in tropical regions.

> The greatest cost to western nations would initially come through losing a natural absorber of the most important greenhouse gas.

> Just as the Stern Review brought the economics of climate change into the political arena and helped politicians see the consequences of their policy choices, many in the conservation community believe the Teeb review will lay open the economic consequences of halting or not halting the slide in biodiversity.

> "The numbers in the Stern Review enabled politicians to wake up to reality," said Andrew Mitchell, director of the Global Canopy Programme, an organisation concerned with directing financial resources into forest preservation.

> "Teeb will do the same for the value of nature, and show the risks we run by not valuing it adequately."

> A number of nations, businesses and global organisations are beginning to direct funds into forest conservation, and there are signs of a trade in natural ecosystems developing, analogous to the carbon trade, although it is clearly very early days.

> Some have ethical concerns over the valuing of nature purely in terms of the services it provides humanity; but the counter-argument is that decades of trying to halt biodiversity decline by arguing for the intrinsic worth of nature have not worked, so something different must be tried.

> Whether Mr Sukhdev's arguments will find political traction in an era of financial constraint is an open question, even though many of the governments that would presumably be called on to fund forest protection are the ones directly or indirectly paying for the review.

> But, he said, governments and businesses are getting the point.

> "Times have changed. Almost three years ago, even two years ago, their eyes would glaze over.

> "Today, when I say this, they listen. In fact I get questions asked - so how do you calculate this, how can we monetise it, what can we do about it, why don't you speak with so and so politician or such and such business."

> The aim is to complete the Teeb review by the middle of 2010, the date by which governments are committed under the Convention of Biological Diversity to have begun slowing the rate of biodiversity loss.

CULLOWHEE -- Our state's Coastal Resources Commission is scheduled to hear testimony today about the potential use of hardened structures to prevent coastal erosion. The CRC members should keep in mind that any proposed solutions will depend largely upon whom one asks.

If coastal communities turn to engineers for suggested solutions to beachfront erosion and long-term sea level rise, they'll get a very different answer than they would from scientists.

This is because engineers are in the business of, well, engineering. The consulting engineers who propose beach nourishment projects, inlet realignment projects and, now, terminal groin projects are in effect selling a product.

If you ask a coastal engineer what to do about beach erosion on North Topsail, he/she is unlikely to suggest that you relocate threatened infrastructure, or even that you do nothing. It is in the interest of consulting engineers to fight coastal erosion with engineering projects, as long and as often as possible.

I do not begrudge engineers their profession, but we must keep in mind that all salespeople will paint a rosy picture for their products.

On the other hand, if you ask North Carolina's coastal scientists what to do about long-term erosion, you will get a more nuanced answer. At the risk of being presumptuous, I will offer my view of the consensus opinion of the majority of my colleagues, based on detailed conversations over the last several years.

Relocation of property and infrastructure away from eroding shorelines and high hazard areas should become official state policy. North Carolina has a relatively low density of oceanfront development compared to states such as Florida. Relocation of property is a viable (if not popular) alternative to the building of seawalls and groins.

Holding the line against coastal erosion will become increasingly difficult and exceedingly costly to taxpayers with the projected rise of sea level over the next century.

There is understandable concern within coastal communities regarding the loss of tax base if oceanfront homes are moved or if oceanfront lots are lost. Yet few, if any, studies have been conducted examining the potential benefits of relocating critical infrastructure away from an eroding shoreline. The benefits may outweigh the losses in many cases.

These benefits can include: substantial savings for taxpayers, preservation of the recreational beach (the main economic resource for many tourist towns), an increase in the value of remaining properties, reduced future risk from storm damage and a lighter load for emergency managers. Yet the potential benefits are rarely considered by local communities in planning for the future.

Relocation of some properties could be implemented after severe storms or with financial incentives. I am not suggesting that relocation be mandated or that it will work for all communities.

Relocation of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse was a resounding success. The structure is now safe, and its protection no longer costs taxpayers money.

Beach nourishment, the currently preferred method of fighting coastal erosion, is becoming increasingly expensive. In the future, beaches will need more sand, more frequently. The sand resources are simply not available to fight this battle into the 22nd century. In light of this, relocation may begin to seem like a more reasonable option.

North Carolina has longstanding prohibitions against the use of coastal hard structures (seawalls, groins and jetties) for the protection of private property. As coastal erosion continues, and worsens, there will be tremendous political pressure from oceanfront property owners and the coastal engineering industry to rescind these bans. To do so would signal the demise of North Carolina's recreational beaches.

Science tells us the coast will look different 100 years from now. These changes need not end the coastal economy as we know it. But preserving our recreational beaches and the businesses that depend on them will require insightful and long-term planning. Beginning an honest assessment of how we may deal with future sea level rise can help ensure that our coastal communities remain the beautiful, vibrant places they are today.

Is America Ready to Quit Coal?

By <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/melanie_warner/index.html?inline=nyt-per>MELANIE WARNER
Last May, protesters took over James E. Rogersâ€™s front lawn in Charlotte, N.C., unfurling banners declaring â€œNo new coalâ€ and erecting a makeshift â€œgreen power plantâ€ â€” which, they said in a press release, was fueled by â€œthe previously unexplored energy source known as hot air, which has been found in large concentrationsâ€ at his home.

And so it goes for Mr. Rogers, the chief executive of <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/duke_energy_corporation/index.html?inline=nyt-org>Duke Energy. For three years, environmentalists have been battling to stop his company from building a large coal-fired power plant in southwestern North Carolina. They say it will spew six million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere annually, in addition to producing toxic gases and mountains of fly ash similar to the muck that engulfed a Tennessee community recently.

All Mr. Rogers asks, he said in jest, is that protesters let him know when they want to camp out on his lawn. â€œMaybe next time we can have a little notice and ask them to join us for coffee or tea,â€ he says.

Mr. Rogers and his colleagues may be forgiven for feeling a little under siege these days. The coal industry, which powered the industrial revolution and supplied America with much of its electricity for more than 60 years, is in a fight for its survival.

With concerns over <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier>climate change intensifying, electricity generation from coal, once reliably cheap, looks increasingly expensive in the face of the all-but-certain prospect of regulations that would impose significant costs on companies that emit large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

As a result, utilitiesâ€™ plans for new coal plants are being turned down left and right. In the last two-and-a-half years, plans for 83 plants in the United States have either been voluntarily withdrawn or denied permits by state regulators. The roughly 600 coal-fired power plants in the United States are responsible for almost one-third of the countryâ€™s total carbon emissions, but they are distinctly at odds with a growing outlook that embraces clean energy.

A new campaign against coal by <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/robert_f_jr_kennedy/index.html?inline=nyt-per>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent environmentalist, and the Waterkeeper Alliance is called â€œThe Dirty Lie.â€ Other clean-energy advocates are equally passionate.

â€œIf you care about being a leader on solving global warming problems, you donâ€™t build new coal plants, especially ones that donâ€™t have a way to capture carbon,â€ said Stephen A. Smith, executive director of the Southeastern Alliance for Clean Energy. (Mr. Smithâ€™s group was not involved in the decorating of the Duke executiveâ€™s lawn. That was the handiwork of a small group called Rising Tide, in Asheville.)

This green chorus also includes <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/al_gore/index.html?inline=nyt-per>Al Gore, the former vice president, <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/eric_e_schmidt/index.html?inline=nyt-per>Eric E. Schmidt, the chief executive of <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/google_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org>Google, and <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/harry_reid/index.html?inline=nyt-per>Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, who has called for a moratorium on new coal plants.

Mr. Reid and other Democratic leaders in Congress, emboldened by support from the Obama administration, have promised climate change legislation by the end of the year. While the exact outlines are yet to be determined, lawmakers are discussing plans to force companies to reduce carbon emissions or be required to pay some form of penalty.

Some conservatives in Congress, and the coal industry itself, say the clean energy push is an affordable luxury â€” and a pet cause â€” for people in states that donâ€™t have to rely primarily on coal to produce electricity.

â€œThe costs for those customers in the heartland who get more of their electricity from coal, not only residential but commercial customers, could be significantly higher, at a time when we can least afford it,â€ says Jim Owen, spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, which represents electric utilities. â€œSo we want to make sure that a climate change program is properly designed.â€

Moreover, getting more and more of our energy from squeaky-clean sources like wind, solar and biomass sounds like a great idea, but whether renewables can keep the lights on and our iPods charged remains an open question.

THE coal industry is aware of all of these issues and is fighting back. An industry-financed group called the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity spent $38 million last year informing Americans, via TV and newspaper ads, that coal is the source of 50 percent of their electricity, that it is an abundant domestic resource and, most importantly, that there is the promise of â€œclean,â€ or carbon-free, coal. This argument is what Mr. Kennedyâ€™s group calls â€œthe dirty lie.â€

Nevertheless, the industry sees clean coal technologies as its best hope for joining the ranks of green power. The problem is that the technology, called carbon capture and storage, is still being developed and could make electricity generated by coal more expensive than power from other sources.

â€œThere are 16 gigawatts of new coal-fired generation coming online in the next few years,â€ said Kevin Book, an energy policy analyst at <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/fbr-capital-markets-corporation/index.html?inline=nyt-org>FBR Capital Markets. â€œThey may well be the last plants.â€

Mr. Rogers, 61, may adhere to the pro-coal sentiments of many of his peers, but he is hardly a typical captain of the energy industry. Five years ago, he began advocating for climate change legislation at a time when some companies were still saying human activity had nothing to do with global warming. Mr. Rogers, a native of Birmingham, Ala., considers himself an environmentalist and calls his decision to move forward with the new plant, made shortly after he became chief of Duke in April 2006, a difficult one.

The estimated 240 million tons of carbon dioxide that will be generated over the 40-year life of the plant, known as Cliffside, will probably never be captured, when or if such technology becomes viable. Most proposals to capture gas involve injecting it deep into the earth. But in North and South Carolina, where Duke operates, the underground rock is too porous to contain any gas.

â€œThereâ€™s always been a tension between affordability and clean,â€ Mr. Rogers said in mid-January, sipping a cappuccino on his way to a meeting in Washington with <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/carol_m_browner/index.html?inline=nyt-per>Carol M. Browner, the White House coordinator of energy and climate policy. â€œUltimately we need to be able to meet the energy needs of our customers. Thatâ€™s my biggest obligation.â€

Fulfilling that responsibility through renewable energy wasnâ€™t an option, he said. Duke, which gets 71 percent of its electricity from coal, has only recently delved into <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/solar_energy/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier>solar energy, promising to buy the entire output of a large solar farm in North Carolina and it is seeking final approval to put solar panels on rooftops at hundreds of customer sites. Its first purchase from a wind farm has started flowing to customers in Indiana. All that combined, though, will give Duke only 124 megawatts of energy, compared with 800 planned from Cliffside.

Hoping to mitigate some of the environmental impact of Cliffside, Mr. Rogers has promised to shut down more than an equal amount of older, more polluting power plants by 2018.

Environmentalists are not impressed. They say that Mr. Rogers hasnâ€™t pushed for clean energy with the same vigor he has expended on Cliffside; for instance, he personally lobbied North Carolina utility regulators for Cliffside but not for the solar program. â€œAmong the utility guys heâ€™s the most dangerous because he talks a good game, but his actions are among the worst,â€ said Bruce E. Nilles, who oversees anti-coal initiatives for the <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/sierra_club/index.html?inline=nyt-org>Sierra Club.

Not so, says Mr. Rogers. He says that heâ€™s just a pragmatist, not a hypocrite, and that he has given his full support to Dukeâ€™s solar program.

Even if they want to, itâ€™s going to be hard for utilities to wean themselves off huge coal plants, which are much simpler to plan and build than a collage of smaller alternative energy projects that cannot be counted on for continuous power.

â€œUtilities like to plan their world around big traditional power plants,â€ said Mr. Smith of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. â€œOnly when they are forced are they willing to rethink that business model.â€

Mr. Rogers, after all, was hoping to build two plants at the Cliffside site, but the state awarded only one permit.

Other utilities, though, have sworn off coal for the time being and are eagerly embracing alternative energy. <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/xcel_energy_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org>Xcel Energy, for example, has erected 274 cloud-colored turbines on the gusty plains of northeastern Colorado. It gets about half of its electricity from coal, but it also draws more of its power from wind, almost 3,000 megawatts, than any other utility.

â€œItâ€™s not always easy, but weâ€™re wanting to provide our customers with cleaner and cleaner energy,â€ said Frank P. Prager, vice president for environmental policy at Xcel.

Others have even broader ambitions. <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/dan_reicher/index.html?inline=nyt-per>Dan W. Reicher, Googleâ€™s director for climate change and energy initiatives, is confident itâ€™s possible to wean ourselves off coal. Last year he devised a plan, called Clean Energy 2030, that calls for America to go almost fossil fuel-free by 2030.

His proposal entails keeping electricity demand flat by aggressively pursuing energy efficiency, thus bypassing the need for new coal plants to meet growing demand. All existing coal generation and about half of our current natural gas production would be replaced with a medley of clean electricity propelled by wind, solar, nuclear and other sources.

Michael G. Morris, chief executive of <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/american_electric_power_company/index.html?inline=nyt-org>American Electric Power in Columbus, Ohio, also one of the largest utilities in the country, dismisses Googleâ€™s plan, particularly the idea of eliminating coal-fired electricity by 2030. â€œAbsolutely impossible,â€ he scoffs. â€œIf you can make the wind blow 24/7 that would be good. Maybe Googleâ€™s got a plan for that.â€

Environmentalists counter that there are innovative ways to deal with the fact that wind and solar farms donâ€™t generate nonstop electricity, namely pairing them with natural gas plants, and using emerging energy storage technologies.

Even with creative approaches, clean energy still presents huge challenges. Lots of new wind and solar farms are going to require huge amounts of new transmission lines that will carry that power from remote places to more populated areas, an endeavor that a consortium of grid operators projects will cost as much as $100 billion. Solutions like advanced <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/geothermal_power/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier>geothermal, a promising way to get clean, always-on energy, are still in the development stage and will require huge investments.

For their part, nearly all utility companies yearn for the day when coal isnâ€™t a dirty word and when plants can capture and store their carbon dioxide. No one is a bigger cheerleader for this idea than Mr. Morris of American Electric.

This fall, the 150-foot smokestack at the companyâ€™s Mountaineer coal plant in New Haven, W.Va., will be outfitted with technology that uses chilled ammonia to trap carbon dioxide. The greenhouse gas will then be turned into a liquid and injected into the ground. It will be the first such project that will both capture and store carbon from an existing plant, and Mr. Morris is wildly optimistic. â€œAt the end of the day we will develop this technology,â€ he says.

BUT Mr. Morrisâ€™s plans, as ambitious as they are, say a lot about just how far away â€œclean coalâ€ is. Of the 8.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted annually by the Mountaineer plant, only 100,000 to 300,000 will be removed with the new technology. And American Electric and the maker of the technology, Alstrom, are spending $100 million on the initiative â€” a daunting expense for some producers.

Then there is the cost of doing the carbon removal, which Mr. Book, of FBR Capital Markets, estimates would more than double the price of electricity generated from coal, possibly making it too expensive relative to other sources. â€œThe economic case isnâ€™t there for private companies to do it,â€ he says. â€œThe government is going to have to fund it.â€

Until then, coalâ€™s image problem is likely to persist. â€œCoal is the dirtiest possible fuel,â€ said Patrice Simms, senior attorney for the <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/natural_resources_defense_council/index.html?inline=nyt-org>Natural Resources Defense Council. â€œWe need to move away from our 19th-century fuel source.â€

<http://michiganmessenger.com/12965/cancer-questions-grow-around-fermi-nuclear-plant>Cancer questions grow around Fermi nuclear plant

State health report shows 31 percent increase in cancer rate among young people in Monroe County since 1996

<http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php><http://s9.addthis.com/button1-bm.gif> By <http://michiganmessenger.com/author/emelzer/>Eartha Jane Melzer 2/17/09 7:44 AM
<http://michiganmessenger.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/fermi-by-mandj98.jpg>

The cancer rate among people under the age of 25 in Monroe County rose at more than three times the rate of the rest of the state between 1996 and 2005, according to a report generated by the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH). Between 1996 and 2000, the average rate of cancer cases for this group was 18.5 cases per 100,000 people; between 2001 and 2005, the rate grew to 24.3 per 100,000. Between 1996 and 2000 the statewide rate of cancer for this group was 20.2 per 100,000; between 2001 and 2005, the rate was 21.9.

Monroe is home to DTE Energyâ€™s Fermi II nuclear power plant, which became fully operational in 1988. While industry and government experts dismiss the possibility that local cancer rates are related to the nuclear plant, critics of the plant and nuclear power say more study is needed.

The new report, compiled in response to questions submitted by Michigan Messenger, sheds new light on the issue.

In the 1980s, the cancer rate for young people in Monroe County was below the state average. In the â€™90s this rate grew, and in the first half of 2000 the cancer rate for this group in Monroe was greater than the state average. For the period 1999-2004, there is data to compare the Monroe under 25 cancer rate to both the Michigan and U.S statistics. The rate was 23.5 per 100,000 in Monroe County, 21.5 per 100,000 in Michigan and 19.5 per 100,000 nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

These numbers include all types of cancers reported for this group.

In September, DTE Energy applied for a license to build a new reactor at the Fermi complex. Opponents of the plant say they want more surveillance of local health issues before the project goes forward. They point to North Elementary School (2.2 miles from Fermi) and Jefferson High School, (2.5 miles from the power plant) as reasons for particular concern.

â€œAnecdotally, there is a lot of cancer,â€œ said Michael Keegan, a social scientist and spokesman for the group Donâ€™t Waste Michigan, which is one of several groups that object to the development of a new reactor. â€œWe need to have baseline health studies done and monitor for the occurrence of radionuclides in the environment,â€ he said.

â€œThat is pretty alarming,â€ Keegan said when told about the cancer stats provided by MCDH. â€œThe question is what is the causal agent.â€

The answer is not known.

The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is responsible for overseeing operations at nuclear plants such as Fermi and has â€œadopted limits for nuclear emissions and exposure established by the international scientific community,â€ according to spokeswoman Viktoria Mytling. Agency protocols require that plant operators submit reports about radiation levels at the plant and carry out  periodic inspections of the plant.

Levels of radiation above those considered safe by the NRC have never been detected around any of the stateâ€™s five reactors, according to Bob DeHaan, chief of the Radiological Assessment Division of the state Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). DeHaanâ€™s division measures radiation in the air, water and cowâ€™s milk near nuclear plants. Small amounts of radioactive iodine, an isotope associated with nuclear power plants, have been detected in cowâ€™s milk around Fermi and across the state, he said.

â€œNone of the environmental levels are in excess of what NRC says is allowable,â€ DeHaan said.

DeHaan declined to comment on the Monroe cancer statistics, saying, â€œI am not an epidemiologist.â€

Though the radiation levels may be low, they are a source of concern for some in the area.

â€œSometimes we hear from patients that there are other people with similar cancers in their area,â€ said Dr. Jeffrey Taub, a leukemia specialist at Childrenâ€™s Hospital in Detroit, â€œbut it is hard to link cancer to environmental causes.â€

Dr. Janette Sherman, adjunct professor at Western Michigan Universityâ€™s Environmental Institute and author of â€œLifeâ€™s Delicate Balance: Causes and Prevention of Breast Cancer,â€ has spent her career researching environmental causes of cancer. She said that cancer among young people should be viewed as an indicator for radiation problems associated with nuclear plants.

Radioactive isotopes such as iodine 131, cesium 137 and strontium 90 are passed on to people through cowâ€™s milk, she said. â€œThey come out of the stack and fall on the ground. They permeate the water and are eaten in food.â€

<http://michiganmessenger.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/cows-technically-nina.jpg>

Children are particularly vulnerable to this radiation, she said. â€œIt doesnâ€™t take 40 years to get leukemia if you are a kid.â€

Sherman said that her analysis of leukemia statistics in the United States indicates that kids living near power plants are more likely to get the disease.

Sherman said that the rise in cancer rates around Fermi is significant.

â€œI think people ought to be concerned,â€ she said. â€œWe donâ€™t need to have nuclear power. We have solar and wind and conservation.â€

Shermanâ€™s findings relate to those of a 2007 German study that was touted by that countryâ€™s Federal Office for Radiation Protection as â€œthe most painstakingly designed and most exhaustive survey worldwide.â€

This <http://www.aerzteblatt.de/int/article.asp?id=62000>study, published by the German Childhood Cancer Registry in 2007, found that the rate of leukemia for children under 5 years old who live within 3.1 miles of nuclear reactors is twice the rate experienced by children in the region as a whole. But the study concluded that the increase could not be directly attributed to nuclear activity.â€œPeople in our research division have reviewed the study and concur with its conclusions,â€ said NRC spokeswoman Mylting.

Dr. Rebecca Head, health officer for the Monroe County Health Department, said that the health department is not involved with cancer cases.

â€œIf there really is an increase in the rate of cancer then I would expect the state to either do their own study or call in the federal agency associated with the CDC,â€ she said.

The CDCâ€™s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry â€œcan sometimes come in and do studies to find out what is going on and whether they can attribute it to any factor,â€ she said â€œWe donâ€™t have money to do our own program much less to take on an expensive survey.â€

MDCH spokesman James McCurtis said that his agency is not involved in investigating cancer trends in Monroe County and that agency epidemiologists generally only initiate investigations when asked to do so by county health departments.

John Austerberry, a spokesman for DTE Energy, told Michigan Messenger that he was unaware that state data shows rising cancer rates among young people in Monroe.

â€œI had not heard of that,â€ he said. â€œI donâ€™t think that we undertake studies of that nature because it is being done by a number of government agencies.â€

In comments submitted to the NRC at a recent open house about plans for a new reactor, Joe Mangano, a New Jersey-based public health expert with the Radiation and Public Health project, urged an investigation of cancer rates in Monroe County.

â€œThose who create a poison are responsible for demonstrating that it is safe (this is the Precautionary Principle in public health),â€ Mangano told Michigan Messenger in an e-mail exchange. â€œBut instead of utilities and the NRC conducting studies, they set an arbitrary limit of radiation emissions and exposure, and declare any levels below this to be â€™safe.â€™ Neither utilities nor the NRC conducts health studies â€” they donâ€™t even monitor local cancer rates near reactors â€” and they strongly criticize any studies that suggest harm.â€

<http://www.publicintegrity.org/articles/entry/1144/>Coal Ash: The Hidden Story

How Industry and the EPA Failed To Stop a Growing Environmental Disaster

By Kristen Lombardi | February 19, 2009

Pat Nees never liked the water at the Moose Lodge. Almost everyone in tiny Colstrip, Montana, drank and dined at Lodge #2190, but the well water was notorious â€” it smelled like a sewer. It felt oily, gritty from sediment. Lodge members braving a drink â€” Nees among them â€” frequently doubled over from indigestion.

Nees, 57, a board member at the lodge, fielded numerous complaints about the water. But he and fellow Moose members, many of them equipment operators and technicians at the nearby Colstrip Steam Electric Station, a giant coal-fired power plant, never thought twice about the massive waste ponds a half mile away.

They never fathomed they were drinking water laced with coal ash.

Coal ash is the collective term for the various solid remnants left over from burning the black rock to produce electricity at more than 500 power plants nationwide. The ash amounts to dirty stuff, replete with toxic constituents â€” arsenic, chromium, lead, mercury, and many others â€” that can wreak havoc on the environment and human health. Exposure to its toxins can lead to cancer, birth defects, gastro-intestinal illnesses, and reproductive problems.

<http://projects.publicintegrity.org/coalash/><http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/img/CoalAsh_Screenshot_thumb.jpg>Coal Ash Country: Power plant wastes fill ponds and landfills nationwide. Explore the locations of these sites by <http://projects.publicintegrity.org/coalash/>clicking here and searching by zip code.

For decades, the dangers of coal ash had largely been hidden from public view. That all changed in December 2008, when an earthen dam holding a billion gallons of coal ash in a pond collapsed in eastern Tennessee, deluging 300 acres in gray muck, destroying houses and water supplies, and dirtying a river.

But what happened in the Volunteer State represents just a small slice of the potential threat from coal ash. In many states â€” at ponds, landfills, and pits where coal ash gets dumped â€” a slow seepage of the ashâ€™s metals has poisoned water supplies, damaged ecosystems, and jeopardized citizensâ€™ health. In July 2007, the <http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/pdf/CoalAsh-Doc1.pdf>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency identified 63 â€œproven or potential damage casesâ€ in 23 states where coal ash has tarnished groundwater and harmed ecology. Additional cases of contamination have since surfaced in states as far-flung as Maryland, New Mexico, Indiana, and Virginia. And in some locations, like Colstrip, the contamination has resulted in multimillion-dollar payouts to residents enduring the devastation.

Despite the litany of damage, thereâ€™s no meaningful federal regulation of coal ash on the books; indeed, oversight of ash disposal â€” much of it stunningly casual â€” is largely left to the states. Argument over EPAâ€™s potential role in regulating the waste has flared for 28 years, most prominently in a furious inter-agency battle back in 2000. The machinations back then tell a little-understood story about the raw politics and hard-edged cost-benefit analyses that often determine the outcome of national environmental policy. And that story still resonates today, as the U.S. coal industry engages in a massive publicity campaign pitching â€œclean coalâ€ as a solution to both global warming and energy independence. In the wake of the Tennessee spill, as fervent new demands for action ring out on Capitol Hill, the debate over federal regulation of coal ash is flaring anew. But the outcome of that debate remains far from certain.

A River of Waste

Photo by Bob Zellar. Reprinted with permission from the Billings Gazette. Each year, power companies generate approximately 130 million tons of coal ash â€” enough to fill a million railroad cars. Industry representatives estimate 43 percent of coal ash now gets recycled in such items as concrete or wallboard â€” two â€œbeneficial usesâ€ that use one type of coal ash. But that still leaves more than 70 million tons of ash annually for companies to dump in lagoons, landfills, and, more recently, mine pits. Today, there are 194 landfills and 161 ponds containing coal ash in 47 states, according to 2005 data from the Department of Energy, the latest available. Estimates from the EPA in 2000 were higher: 600 total landfills and ponds containing coal ash. And an unknown number of active and abandoned coal mines also are filled with the stuff. These sites are ground zero for the ongoing controversy over coal ash.

Although the industry professes that these sites are safe, the problem is that every year, some of them leak. And what oozes into the soil and water are dangerous substances: antimony, boron, cadmium, selenium, mercury. In July 2006, the National Academy of Sciences identified 24 potentially hazardous metals in coal ash. And the list is likely to grow. As the EPA tightens controls on emissions through the air, power companies are capturing more particulates and metals in the solid wastes, like coal ash. The Academyâ€™s 2006 report documents that result. Commissioned by the EPA, the study examined risks associated with the burgeoning practice of â€œminefilling,â€ or dumping coal ash in mines, and catalogued the way the ash can pollute ground and surface water. â€œThe presence of high contaminant levels in many [coal ash] leachates,â€ says the report, â€œmay create human health and ecological concerns at or near some mine sites over the long term.â€

The EPAâ€™s own research mirrors this conclusion. An <http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/pdf/CoalAsh-Doc2.pdf>August 2007 draft report prepared for the agency analyzed hazards associated with ponds and landfills, and found that coal ash doesnâ€™t pose a problem for nearby residents when power companies employ such protections as liners. But the threats arise when utilities dump the waste in unlined or partially lined ponds and pits, and there have been more than 180 such sites identified nationwide. Indeed, the analysis determined such sites pose a cancer risk from arsenic at 900 times the level of what was deemed safe. And concentrations of boron soared beyond safety levels for birds, frogs, and fish. Some EPA scientists believe that recent toxicity data would double the assessment of the hazards.

â€œThese materials are definitely dangerous,â€ notes Mark Squillace of the University of Coloradoâ€™s Natural Resources Law Center, who served on the committee behind the NAS report. â€œThe environmental risks [associated with disposal] are grave.â€

Perils are further evidenced in the EPAâ€™s list of â€œdamage cases.â€ By July 2007, the agency had confirmed 24 â€œprovenâ€ cases in 13 states where coal ash has compromised water quality, as well as the local ecology â€” more than twice the number identified in 2000. The EPA has also recognized another 39 â€œpotentialâ€ damage cases in 17 states. In some instances, pollution has degraded water supplies enough to exceed safety standards. In others, the pollution has so defiled lakes and streams that some fish species have gone extinct. Consider this roster:

â€¢ In Pines, Indiana, one million tons of coal ash dumped at an unlined landfill contaminated 163 residential wells with boron, arsenic, lead, and manganese; in January 2002 the state proposed listing it as a Superfund site and EPA has since overseen the ongoing clean-up.

â€¢ In Cartersville, Georgia, an ash pond leaked 2.25 million gallons of sludge containing 281 tons of coal ash into a tributary, resulting in a $31,250 fine.

â€¢ In South Carolina, near the Savannah River, two leaking ponds have sullied a wetland, where bullfrogs have suffered deformities..

EPAâ€™s critics believe that such cases reflect the proverbial tip of the iceberg â€” partly because the agency doesnâ€™t investigate ash dumpsites, and partly because many disposal facilities lack adequate monitoring. A 2006 Energy Department study found that groundwater at 20 percent of recently constructed ponds examined was not being monitored; an earlier study of existing ponds had found 62 percent unmonitored.

And environmental groups have documented a substantial number of cases yet to make the EPAâ€™s list. Last February, <http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/pdf/CoalAsh-Doc3.pdf>66 organizations petitioned the agency to recognize 16 incidents in nine states where, they say, coal ash has caused severe degradation. And more cases have cropped up since. In Chesapeake, Virginia, for example, developers used 1.5 million tons of coal ash to build a golf course over a shallow aquifer, only to watch the ash blacken 30 residential wells. In the Four Corners region, where New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah meet, environmental groups say millions of tons of ash annually generated by two power plants have poisoned area springs.

<http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/img/Ash1.JPG>Coal ash recovery wells dot the landscape surrounding the Colstrip plant. Photo by Kristen Lombardi. Still other cases have caught the attention of environmental lawyers, who are busy testing water sources and laying groundwork for possible legal action. Just last November, the largest class-action lawsuit involving coal-ash contamination ended in a $45 million settlement for hundreds of residents of Gambrills, Maryland, where a utility had tossed 3.8 million tons of coal ash into two gravel pits. The lax disposal had polluted 84 wells with arsenic, lead, and cadmium.

Back in Colstrip, Montana, the coal-ash ponds have caused such widespread damage that the consortium which owns the plant paid $25 million last spring to settle a similar suit filed by 57 residents. Here, the ash hasnâ€™t tarnished individual wells so much as entire aquifers. Its toxic plumes have traveled far over two decades. â€œItâ€™s obvious the pollution has gone farther than was initially reported,â€ says Tom Ring, of the Montana Department of Environmental Quality. â€œItâ€™s clearly spreading.â€

A Coal-Burning Behemoth

Colstrip sits above the Rosebud seam, a layer of sub-bituminous coal running through the Powder River Basin, a perfect place for a power plant. The hamlet of trailers and bungalows that makes up the town exists solely because of the electric station. The place boomed in the â€™70s and â€™80s, when plant construction drew thousands. And while itâ€™s faded since, Colstrip remains a company town, populated by 2,300 folks toiling at the utility or the local mine that feeds nine million tons of coal a year into the power plantâ€™s furnaces.

A metal behemoth, the plantâ€™s four generators give off a constant rumble. Operated by PPL Montana and owned by a consortium including other firms â€” Avista Corporation, PacifiCorp, Portland General Electric, NorthWestern Energy, and Puget Sound Energy â€” it burns a boxcar of coal every five minutes, powering a million and a half households up and down the West Coast. As the operator, PPL Montana speaks for the plant.

Residents near the plant donâ€™t seem to mind the air pollutants pouring out of the stacks â€” Colstrip station â€œscrubsâ€ 95 percent of noxious gases from the smoke. What gets them is the coal ash â€” 964,000 tons of waste in 2005, the most recent year for which Energy Department statistics are available. The plantâ€™s scrubbers pump ash slurry into an elaborate pond system at 7,500 gallons per minute. The acidic smell of the pond isnâ€™t easily forgotten. The two biggest ponds â€” one spans 168 acres; the other, 367 â€” bookend the town. Tom Ring, the state environmental-science specialist overseeing the plant, describes a <http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/pdf/CoalAsh-Doc4.pdf>six-page list of almost two dozen chemicals in the ponds as â€œa table of woe.â€

<http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/pdf/CoalAsh-Doc5.pdf>State records and company documents revealed in court peg the so-called Stage Ponds as top culprits for leakage of some of those chemicals. Built in 1976 with a clay buffer, the Stage 1 Pond began oozing pollutants as far back as 1979 and has continued to do so â€” even though it was â€œcappedâ€â€” covered over with a liner â€” in 1997. Its companion, the Stage 2 Pond, came online in the â€˜90s, and still receives coal ash at 3,000 gallons per minute; lined with plastic, this pond has failed 18 times.

The consequences werenâ€™t known until residents sued the consortium over groundwater issues in 2003. Through the discovery process, documents obtained by the plaintiffs show that coal ash has befouled groundwater hundreds of feet beyond the ponds with boron, sulfate, and chloride, among other chemicals. Pollutants have also corrupted a handful of wells in neighborhoods below the Stage ponds; other wells, drilled through the pollution, have been rendered inoperable.

<http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/img/Ash2.jpg>Wayne Johnson in his Colstrip backyard, now rendered worthless by groundwater pollution from coal ash. Photo by Kristen Lombardi.â€œWe were in the dark for so long,â€ says Wayne Johnson, a slight, stoic retiree who lives with his wife, Virginia, beneath the 80-foot dam holding ash in the Stage 2 Pond.

Not that there werenâ€™t warning signs. Take the water at the Moose Lodge, for instance. Nees says the board eventually tested the well, only to find contaminants hovering above safety levels. Members began hauling water in jugs, never tying their predicament to the ponds situated on an overlying plateau. And neither did Nees, a 29-year veteran of the plant.

But the power companies were documenting coal-ash contamination. Since the mid-â€˜80s, plant hydrogeologists <http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/pdf/CoalAsh-Doc6.pdf>had tracked a filthy plume of boron emanating from the Stage ponds. Essential to plant life in low doses, boron turns lethal at levels of 2 milligrams per liter, and presents a litany of other health hazards. The EPA has issued in draft a â€œhealth reference levelâ€ for boron not to exceed drinking-water standards of 1.4 milligrams per liter. By 1993, the lodgeâ€™s well had already exhibited unsafe concentrations at twice that level. In 2000 and subsequent years, records show its boron levels were reaching up to 13 times the limit.

â€œItâ€™s amazing, isnâ€™t it?â€ asks Nees. Now retired, Nees is soft-spoken and exceedingly polite, but his face reddens when he talks about the bouts of diarrhea he suffered after drinking the lodgeâ€™s water. In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs donâ€™t tie illnesses directly to the coal-ash contamination. But Alan Nye, a Montana toxicologist who reviewed the contamination data on their behalf, noted in court records that â€œprivate wells contaminated by theâ€¦ plume should not be used for irrigation water or for drinking by people or animals.â€

Judie Soiseth, a petite woman who ignored the rainbow film in her water, ceased using it once her cats refused to lap it up. â€œEvery time I used [the water] I felt maybe I shouldnâ€™t,â€ confides Soiseth, who was diagnosed with nodules on her thyroid and believes they are somehow tied to the water.

In a statement, the company calls the $25 million settlement reached in May â€œa good outcome for all parties involved.â€ It stresses that PPL Montana â€œinherited the groundwater issues after it purchased an interest in Colstrip in 1999 and took immediate steps to correct themâ€ â€” installing monitoring wells and modern pond liners. The lawsuit prompted the company to spend $900,000 to extend municipal water to the neighborhoods below the ponds.

â€œPPL Montana will continue to take appropriate actions to help alleviate concerns that people have about their wells,â€ the statement reads, â€œand help prevent any risk of contamination.â€

According to state records, however, the coal-ash ponds are still leaking, forcing PPL Montana to build wells to recover contamination. Made of giant metal cylinders, the wells are drilled 300 feet into the ground and topped by electric pumps that pull out the polluted water and cycle it back to the ash ponds. A second lawsuit over ash contamination, filed by residents in 2007 and currently pending, suggests more trouble. It claims that the plantâ€™s largest pond has unleashed slurry towards two cattle ranches and tainted a creek.

â€˜Dangerous Stuffâ€™

<http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/img/Ash3.JPG> A Colstrip construction site where new recovery wells are being installed. Photo by Kristen Lombardi. Nothing about the existence of the Colstrip ash ponds violates state regulations. Nor are there federal rules for dumping the toxic slurry. Coal ash is hazardous by any common definition â€” â€œItâ€™s dangerous stuff. â€¦ Thatâ€™s what the public thinks of when thinking of the word â€˜hazardous,â€™ â€ says one former EPA employee. But the agency has yet to designate coal ash â€œhazardousâ€ under federal waste laws â€” a key designation that triggers strict controls for handling, transporting, and dumping waste: power plants, for instance, would have to use expensive protections such as liners at disposal sites, or regularly monitor groundwater for any leaching. Instead, coal ash disposal falls under rules for â€œnon-hazardousâ€ waste, leaving oversight to the states. The result is a patchwork of standards; at least 20 percent of the states, including Montana, exempt some or all coal ash from solid-waste regulations.

This isnâ€™t to say the EPA has ignored the issue; the agency, in fact, has been involved in a debate over coal ash regulation for almost 30 years. In 1980, Congress passed the so-called â€œBevill Amendment,â€ named for former Representative Tom Bevill of Alabama, establishing hurdles for hazardous-waste regulation of coal ash. The amendment required the EPA to study the health and environmental effects of coal ash before deeming it hazardous, and even laid out eight factors to be considered. The son of a coal miner, Bevill, now deceased, made plain his motivation. â€œWe possess the worldâ€™s largest reserves of coal,â€ Bevill said. â€œWe must provide incentives, not disincentives, for its use.â€ The EPA later released two reports to Congress â€” first in 1988, then in â€™99 â€” affirming that coal-ash damage did not reach a threshold high enough for hazardous-waste regulation under the Bevill amendmentâ€™s criteria.

But in 2000, after a vigorous push by environmental groups including the Clean Air Task Force and Citizens Coal Council, agency officials reassessed the situation. By then, advocates for more regulation had documented 59 cases in which they said coal ash caused degradation â€” almost 10 times as many as those identified by EPA. â€œThe information,â€ says Michael McCabe, then EPAâ€™s deputy administrator, â€œforced EPA to take a look at the issue again and really try to assess the potential environmental and public health impacts of large quantities of this material.â€

What to do about coal ash soon became a topic of vigorous debate within the agency. According to interviews with more than a dozen former and current EPA insiders, many staff in the Office of Solid Waste agreed with the non-hazardous regulatory approach â€” partly because theyâ€™d already run up against the Bevill amendment, and partly because they believed the risks posed by coal ash were low. Others argued that going forward with hazardous-waste regulations would eliminate unsafe dumping of coal ash in unlined or partially lined lagoons and landfills nationwide â€” 350 of them at the time. Debate extended to staff in the EPAâ€™s Office of Air and Radiation, which was working to regulate mercury emissions from power plants. â€œWe saw that more emissions controls meant more solid waste,â€ relays one policy analyst from the air office, â€œand we didnâ€™t want to create more harm.â€ One top official in the air office who backed a â€œhazardousâ€ designation even appealed directly to Carol Browner, who then headed the EPA and who now serves as President Barack Obamaâ€™s top adviser on energy and climate change issues.

â€œYou donâ€™t just go to the administrator unless you care strongly about something,â€ the official says today, â€œand I remember being convinced that coal ash should be regulated as hazardous.â€

In March 2000, the agency seemed on the verge of proposing stricter federal controls. Staff in the solid-waste office wrote a draft determination essentially classifying coal ash as â€œcontingent hazardous wasteâ€ â€” a hybrid designation. In the <http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/pdf/CoalAsh-Doc7.pdf>91-page document, which the Center for Public Integrity obtained from the White Houseâ€™s Office of Management and Budget, the agency proposed to regulate the dumping of coal ash in ponds, landfills, and mine pits with â€œtailoredâ€ national standards. If power companies were to abide by them, the document states, â€œwastes would remain non-hazardous.â€ If not, the coal ash would be classified as â€œhazardous.â€ In effect, agency officials were straddling the regulatory line to encourage better management. The draft determination states, in part, that the tailored regulations are the best solution in light of â€œthe evidence of actual and potential damage to human health or the environment from these wastes, the sheer volume of wastesâ€¦ [and] the significant number of facilities that do not currently have basic controls in placeâ€¦â€

Browner, who declined to comment for this article, sent the draft determination, dated March 5, 2000, to the OMB for review, which set off a frenzy of lobbying by the utility industry. The White House was inundated with letters from trade organizations such as the Edison Electric Institute and the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group (USWAG) â€” the industryâ€™s voice on coal-ash disposal â€” criticizing the draft. One letter, signed by then-USWAG chairman Fred McGuire and 13 other industry representatives, warned that â€œthe high costs of [hazardous] regulationâ€¦ will ultimately be shared nationwide by employees, taxpayers, ratepayers, investors, and customers.â€ Another letter, from the presidents of 16 energy companies, blasted the proposal as â€œover-regulation and an unwarranted intrusion into an area of primary state responsibility.â€

By late March, more than two dozen industry representatives had met with OMB policy analysts and EPA senior managers â€” in two meetings â€” during which they stressed the â€œstigmaâ€ of a hazardous label. Consider the notes taken by an EPA staffer at one such meeting â€” notes obtained by the Center for Public Integrity through the Freedom of Information Act:

> Industry â€” any control under [the hazardous designation] would have a chilling effect. Dramatic and immediate effectâ€¦ Bad public policy â€” this would create a burdensome cost on consumers with no benefitâ€¦ More and more controls are in place â€” the problem is healing itself.
Public officials in 13 states, including Montana and Tennessee, also voiced their opposition to the EPAâ€™s draft determination, as did federal agencies such as the Department of Energy and the Department of Interiorâ€™s <http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/pdf/CoalAsh-Doc8.pdf>Office of Surface Mining. Seventy-seven members of Congress wrote letters to senior officials at the EPA, OMB, and the White House opposing the proposal. One letter, signed by 11 representatives, summed up the tone. â€œ[Coal] combustion wastes have long been recognized as posing little if any environmental compliance problems,â€ it reads. â€œNo one can seriously claim that the states have failed to act responsibly in this area, or that Federal intervention is necessary.â€ Among the signers was Rep. Nick Rahall of West Virginia, who currently serves as chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources.

The draft determination, recalls an EPA policy analyst, â€œreally hit a brick wall at OMB.â€ The issue, insiders say, was cost; indeed, a March 16, 2000, record of questions from the OMB to EPA staff shows a focus on the economic impact that hazardous-waste regulations would have on utilities. The EPA estimated that additional expenses would hover around $1 billion a year, but the utility industry later termed that figure â€œwoefully underestimated.â€ <http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/pdf/CoalAsh-Doc9.pdf>One analysis commissioned by USWAG pegged the costs as high as $13.8 billion annually.

<http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/img/Ash5.JPG>The B&R and Seward subdivisions, which now sit on ground contaminated by coal ash, rise behind a polluted well at the Colstrip Moose Lodge. Photo by Kristen Lombardi.Beyond economics, some of EPAâ€™s research seemed weak. Andrew Wittner, the agency economist who analyzed the risks of coal ash from 1995 to 2003 remembers that some toxic metals, especially arsenic, exceeded the threshold for safety standards â€” but only based on limited data. Attributing problems to a faulty computer model, he says, â€œI could not show these materials were sufficiently hazardous.â€

Ultimately, the EPA had to reverse the draft â€œhazardousâ€ designation. Instead, in a final regulatory determination published on May 22, 2000, the agency pledged to issue less stringent national standards under a â€œnon-hazardousâ€ designation â€” which essentially would have amounted to guidelines telling states what their coal ash disposal rules should look like. In the 24-page notice in the Federal Register, the agency went on to note the utility industryâ€™s improving practices, as well as the statesâ€™ improving regulations as the primary reasons for the reversal.

Matthew Hale, director of the EPAâ€™s solid-waste office, declined requests to be interviewed, as did Richard Kinch, the manager who has overseen the coal ash research and policy work. In answer to written questions, the EPAâ€™s press office provided a five-page statement which states that, â€œa range of issues came up during administrative review of EPAâ€™s draft determination on coal combustion residue, including cost.â€ The final regulatory determination, the EPA says, â€œreflected the Agencyâ€™s judgment as to the most appropriate regulatory approach.â€

Timothy Fields, who ran the EPAâ€™s Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response in 2000, remembers the agencyâ€™s final determination having more to do with internal discussions between top officials at the EPA, OMB, and White House Council on Environmental Quality than any outside pressure. Throughout the OMB review, he says, it became apparent that the EPA lacked not only the administrative record to justify its draft, but also the needed inter-agency backing.

â€œThere was some consensus that the draft determination was going too far and the problems of coal ash could be dealt with in another way. This wasnâ€™t the way to do it,â€ says John Spotila, Clintonâ€™s administrator in OMBâ€™s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in 2000.

EPA deputy administrator McCabe puts it more bluntly: â€œWe felt [non-hazardous regulation] was appropriate at the time given the little effort weâ€™d made to do the political groundwork.â€ He and his EPA colleagues had failed to reach out to Congress, federal officials, and the industry to inform them of the proposed policy change, he says, and to win their support. â€œYou cannot just spring these things on the process,â€ McCabe adds. â€œYouâ€™ve got toâ€¦ do your science work and your political homework, too, so youâ€™re not shot out of the water.â€

Insiders say the calculus was fueled in part by a belief that then-Vice President Al Gore would win the 2000 presidential election, opening up the prospect that top EPA officials could implement the non-hazardous federal standards, and work toward building a case for hazardous-waste regulations.

But that didnâ€™t happen. And the Bush administrationâ€™s EPA never followed through on the 2000 promise to issue those non-hazardous standards. The EPAâ€™s solid-waste office shifted its focus from disposal of coal ash to promotion of its beneficial reuse, launching programs to encourage the ashâ€™s safe recycling in concrete, wallboard, and construction fill (where the toxic metals act like cement, as opposed to leaching). Marianne Horinko, the solid-waste officeâ€™s assistant administrator from 2001 to 2004, admits she made beneficial reuse a top priority, but insists that â€œthere sure was not a conscious effort on my part to stop the rulemaking from happening.â€ Horinko says her tenure was consumed by the environmental fallout of 9/11; â€œTo say that I was greatly distracted would be the understatement of the century.â€

Meanwhile, the EPA has kept up a dialogue on its proposed rulemaking with the utility industry. The discussions would yield what the industryâ€™s USWAG calls its â€œvoluntary action plan,â€ issued in October 2006. Power companies signing on effectively promise, first, to implement groundwater monitoring at disposal sites; second, to install liners and other controls before dumping coal ash in pits; and third, to â€œconsiderâ€ the more environmentally sound option of dumping coal ash in dry landfills, as opposed to wet lagoons. Jim Roewer, the USWAG director, says 75 percent of the trade groupâ€™s membership has agreed to the plan, which he claims â€œwill result in fewer problems that weâ€™ll have to take care of down the road.â€

Environmentalists disagree. After all, they note, the â€œvoluntary action planâ€ does not require power companies to install the most protective and thus expensive controls, let alone force them to clean up contamination. â€œItâ€™s really a sham,â€ charges Lisa Evans, an attorney for EarthJustice who used to enforce federal waste laws for the EPA. â€œIt would in no way be a replacement for real regulations.â€

The EPA, in its statement, says that voluntary plans have perks â€” â€œthey can often be implemented more quickly than new regulationsâ€ â€” but that â€œit has not determined that it is considering this voluntary plan in lieu of [non-hazardous] regulation.â€

<http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/img/Ash6.JPG>An 80-foot-high containment wall for a coal-ash storage pond blends into the landscape near the Colstrip plant. Photo by Kristen Lombardi.Industry representatives still argue that the states have adequate regulations. This time, their claims seem bolstered by a 2006 energy department survey examining newly constructed ponds and landfills. The report found a trend toward more modern controls â€” ponds with monitoring wells grew by 20 percent, for instance â€” as well as more stringent state regulations.

â€œThe question isnâ€™t whether we should regulate coal ash,â€ Roewer argues, â€œbut who should be regulating the materials. We support the state regulations in place today.â€

Roewer maintains that most cases involving coal-ash contamination stem from old practices no longer in vogue. â€œWhen we have seen damage cases, the utilities have moved to address the problem and clean up the sites,â€ he says, citing the 15 cases on the EPAâ€™s damages list for which the agency has confirmed corrective action, such as laying new liners.

â€œThe industry gets so much mileage out of saying, â€˜Oh, that happened in the â€˜80s,â€™â€ counters Evans of EarthJustice, even though it can take decades to detect coal-ash contamination. What the damage cases show her is that state regulators havenâ€™t done a good job at preventing harm. Asks Evans, â€œDo we want to have this slow, inconsistent approach and leave this trail of pollution â€” or not?â€

Reality Check

Back in Colstrip, the situation seems to undermine the industryâ€™s claims. Montana lawmakers have actually loosened key protections preventing coal-ash contamination â€” first, by exempting on-site disposal from the stateâ€™s solid-waste regulations; second, by gutting a law meant to manage the citing of coal-fired power plants. Both acts have left the stateâ€™s Department of Environmental Quality with little authority over this waste.

As a result, Colstrip station â€” a â€œlegacyâ€ plant built when those regulations were still in effect â€“ is now the only plant whose coal ash the state oversees. But its widespread plumes of ash have laid bare the fact that the power companies long operated their ponds as if state regulatory agency rules didnâ€™t apply. The plantâ€™s January 1976 permit mandates that the ponds act as a â€œclosed-loop systemâ€ that â€œdoes not discharge effluents from the plant downstream or into other waters.â€ Any seepage, it states, â€œis not anticipated to impair the quality of [area] groundwater.â€ Under the permit, state regulators can fine the companies $10,000 a day for tarnishing water. Yet, Ring, the Montana regulator, confirms, â€œThat has never happened.â€

â€œThe moral of this story,â€ argues Jory Ruggiero, the lawyer representing Colstrip residents and handling the second suit, â€œis thatâ€¦ a regulatory rule on the books isnâ€™t enough.â€

Neither, apparently, is the promise that each utility will carefully manage its ash waste. At Colstrip, plant supervisors were forecasting that the Stage 2 Pond would â€œdefinitely cause degradationâ€ of residential wells as far back as the â€˜80s, according to <http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/pdf/CoalAsh-Doc10.pdf>one company memorandum. Back then, the companies not only allocated $250,000 for a city water line to residents â€” the same line they would install 20 years later â€” but also did exactly what USWAGâ€™s plan dictates: they considered using a dry ash landfill, instead of a pond, for the ash. Still, the companies ended up going with the dirtier option â€” the pond â€” because, as a February 1985 analysis makes plain, â€œthe pond method is less expensive.â€

<http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/img/Ash7.JPG>The Colstrip plantâ€™s Stage 2 coal-ash storage pond is barely visible from the surrounding roadways. Photo by Kristen Lombardi.

Today, PPL Montana, under the stateâ€™s direction, is installing recovery wells to cycle contamination back into them. Last October, 17 electric pumps and metal tanks appeared behind the Moose Lodge, area businesses, and two subdivisions. Thatâ€™s beyond the 12 wells PPL Montana had already drilled. Even more were popping up along the polluted creek, a golf course, and a baseball field â€” more than 1,400 feet beyond the Stage 2 pond. Ring says the decades-old strategy for cleaning up spills is working â€œto the extent [it] has been capturing a large amount of contaminated water.â€ But residents such as Chris Coats, an earnest housewife, find it â€œa joke.â€ As she says, â€œIt is effectively allowing the ponds to continue to leak.â€

PPL Montana has begun to use a so-called â€œpasteâ€ on some ponds, turning the slurry into a toothpaste-like consistency to reduce its water content. But the practice pales in comparison to the $30 million to $80 million it would take to cap the ponds for good.

Environmental advocates have long argued that some sort of federal standards would help plug such state-regulatory shortfalls. Jeff Stant of the Environmental Integrity Project, who in 2000 lobbied the EPA to regulate coal ash, considers the Colstrip case â€œone of the best examples of why you need federal regulations.â€ In the wake of the Tennessee spill, Stant and his fellow advocates are pushing for federal regulation again. â€œWe cannot have industry regulating itself,â€ he said at a January news conference. â€œThat has got to end.â€

Current and former EPA insiders alike claim that national standards â€” even broad federal guidelines under a non-hazardous designation â€” would prevent more Colstrips. Wittner, the retired EPA economist, argues that, because of the political power of the utilities, â€œthese [industry] guys have been getting away with murder at the state level.â€ Wittner, like most insiders who see a need for federal regulations, backs the non-hazardous approach. He believes that even non-hazardous federal guidelines could have forced Montana regulators to ban the Colstrip ponds and phase them out of service â€” or, at least, stop their chronic leakage.

â€œEPA should be drafting up regulations as we speak,â€ adds Wittner, who wrote a June 3, 2008, letter to staff of the House Natural Resources Committee stating as much and criticizing the EPA for what he called â€œan unquestioned violation of public trust.â€

Now that the Tennessee disaster has thrust the coal-ash debate into headlines, the EPA is facing renewed pressure. On January 8, the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works held a hearing on the massive spill, during which senators expressed support for some kind of federal intervention. The committee chair, Senator Barbara Boxer of California, took aim at the EPA for refusing to set national standards. â€œInaction has allowed this enormous volume of toxic material to go largely unregulated,â€ she said. â€œIt may be that EPA needs to regulate coal ash as hazardous. Some argue it goes too far but, clearly, the lack of any regulation is not good enough.â€

On January 13, Representative Edward Markey, of Massachusetts, who heads the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee that oversees the EPA, wrote to then-EPA administrator Stephen Johnson, terming the lack of a national policy â€œunacceptable.â€ The next day, Rahall â€” the West Virginia Congressman who objected to coal-ash regulation in 2000 â€” filed legislation requiring federal design, engineering, and performance standards for ash ponds such as the one that collapsed in Tennessee. And later that day, Senator Boxer pressed the issue with the incoming EPA administrator, Lisa Jackson, during her confirmation hearing. Jackson promised to immediately assess all ponds and landfills, and to reconsider the regulatory options.

To hear congressional observers, the drama of the Tennessee spill has shifted the dynamic of the coal-ash debate enough to sway some who once doubted the severity of the problem. Case in point: Congressman Rahall, who so vigorously opposed the hazardous label, but who now remains open to the prospect. â€œWe wouldnâ€™t be opposed to it,â€ says Jim Zoia, Rahallâ€™s staff director, explaining: â€œThe amount of toxic material has changed with the advances of air-pollution control technologies over the last 20 yearsâ€¦ We see coal ash as more of a threat [today].â€

Rahall sent a letter dated Feb. 3 to the new EPA administrator, urging the agency to â€œexpeditiously move forward with a rulemaking governing the disposal of coal cumbustion wastes under the auspices of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,â€ although he does not push for a specific approach. Aides for Boxer and Markey sound a similarly vague note, saying that they want the nuances â€” hazardous versus non-hazardous â€” to come from the new administration.

The EPAâ€™s press office states only that the agency is continuing to mull over the data and has yet to reach any conclusions, although it does acknowledge that the â€œEPA could revisit the May 2000 Regulatory Determination.â€

Environmentalists want the agency to return to the ill-fated â€œcontingent hazardous wasteâ€ designation, but they know that wonâ€™t be easy. â€œThe utilities are very well entrenched in Congress,â€ is how Stant puts it. In 2007 and 2008, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, power companies donated $16 million to federal lawmakersâ€™ political campaigns â€” split between Republicans ($8.1 million) and Democrats ($7.9 million) â€” and spent $269.6 million on lobbying efforts. USWAG alone â€” the industry organ on coal-ash disposal â€” has reported spending about $360,000 on influencing the EPA, the White House, and both houses over the past nine years. â€œThere may be a lot of citizens who are up in arms about [coal ash],â€ Stant says, â€œbut we donâ€™t have nearly as much power as [the utilities].â€

Industry representatives, for their part, donâ€™t seem especially worried. USWAGâ€™s Roewer says heâ€™s had not one conversation with anyone pushing for hazardous-waste regulations, although he warns that, â€œif there were a draft [from EPA] saying as much, weâ€™d certainly mount a campaign.â€ He suspects the agency will at some point propose to follow through on its delayed rulemaking regarding non-hazardous federal guidelines. And â€œthose would still be implemented by the states,â€ he points out, â€œwhich is what we support.â€

Lingering Doubts

Such Washington debates seem far away to Colstrip residents such as Wayne and Virginia Johnson, sitting in their kitchen, staring at an 80-foot-high dam holding back coal ash from their home. A half dozen recovery wells surround their backyard and form a second barrier between them and the Stage 2 pond. Now that residents have public water, the Johnsons try not to think about all those years of bad water â€” all their washing, cooking, and drinking with it; all their â€œutter concern and fear,â€ as Wayne says. Still, they wonder what the ash-laced water has meant for them and their neighbors. Did it contribute to Virginiaâ€™s breast cancer? Or cause the thyroid nodules afflicting their neighbor, Judie Soiseth? Is it doing the couple harm just to stay here now?

â€œThe settlement never answered those questions,â€ Virginia says, â€œand we probably wonâ€™t get any answers for another twenty years.â€

The Johnsons, like many Colstrip residents, feel a deep sense of betrayal. They still remember the day several years back when PPL Montana sought a right of way to build recovery wells along their property line. Two representatives sat at the coupleâ€™s kitchen table, explaining how the wells would pump polluted groundwater back into the pond above their house.

â€œThey said, â€˜Youâ€™ll never have any trouble,â€™â€ Wayne recalls.

â€œThey lied to us repeatedly,â€ Virginia interjects, her eyes flashing in rage. â€œYouâ€™ve been so deceived and you feel so violated. It would be like someone coming with a garbage truck and dumping a load of garbage in your kitchen.â€

Except that garbage has tougher federal regulations for disposal than coal ash.

Mercury plan shot down

Appeal of emissions credit ruling rejected

By Tony Bartelme
The Post and Courier
Tuesday, February 24, 2009
The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday effectively snuffed an industry-backed effort to allow the buying and selling of mercury emission credits, a plan critics derided as a multimillion-dollar giveaway to polluters.

The high court decided not to hear a Bush-era appeal, letting stand a lower court's ruling against the mercury trading concept. Public health and conservation groups said the Supreme Court's decision is important to South Carolina and other states with significant mercury contamination problems.

The Mercury Connection

<http://charleston.net/news/mercury/><http://media.charleston.net/images/mercury.jpg> <http://charleston.net/news/mercury/>We know mercury taints fish. What about people?.


"This is the final repudiation of an unlawfully lax Bush administration mercury rule that we warned (the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control) not to adopt in part or in full," said Blan Holman, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center in Charleston. "State regulators need to stop settling for weak standards and start reducing mercury contamination from South Carolina coal-fired power plants."

Utilities had favored the so-called mercury cap-and-trade program, saying it would spur innovation while reducing overall emissions. But critics said trading in mercury would allow some plants to release more mercury than others, creating hot spots that could harm people's health.

A federal appeals court struck down the Bush plan last year, and the Bush administration appealed to the Supreme Court. The Obama administration recently said it would drop the appeal, and the Supreme Court's decision Monday not to hear the case formally ended the matter.

Coal-burning utilities said the cap-and-trade program gave them more flexibility to install pollution-control equipment. In response to the Obama administration's move earlier this month, Laura Varn, Santee Cooper corporate communications director, said the utility would comply with "any and all future regulations, whatever they are."

Mercury is a potent neurotoxin linked to brain damage and other health problems. Man-made mercury pollution generally comes from the stacks of coal-fired power plants, factories, cement kilns and incinerators. It drops from the air into rivers and lakes, where it collects in the tissues of fish and other animals.

South Carolina has a severe mercury problem, with warnings to avoid eating certain fish from more than 1,700 miles of rivers, mostly on the coastal plain. A Post and Courier investigation found that people who eat fish from some of these rivers have high levels of mercury in their bodies.

Members of the DHEC board recently cited concerns about mercury in their deliberations over Santee Cooper's plan to build a new coal-fired power plant on the Great Pee Dee River, which has high levels of mercury in fish.

In a split vote, the board eventually decided to give Santee Cooper a permit, though some board members said they felt state pollution laws gave them no choice despite their concerns.

Under the Bush plan, South Carolina would have been allotted 18,560 mercury credits every year until 2018, worth an estimated $40.8 million a year. One DHEC plan called for 80 percent of these credits to be given to power companies free of charge, a move one conservation group lawyer described as a "Christmas club account" for polluters.

> Historic Day for Solar â€“ Next step is to increase efficiencies of thin film from 9-10% up to 15-18%. This should be a research funding priority for DOE.

> First Solar passes $1 per watt industry milestone
> 
> Company cuts manufacturing cost to 98 cents per watt in fourth quarter.

> 25/2/2009

> First Solar, Inc. has announced it reduced its manufacturing cost for solar modules in the fourth quarter to 98 cents per watt, breaking the $1 per watt price barrier.

> â€œThis achievement marks a milestone in the solar industryâ€™s evolution toward providing truly sustainable energy solutions,â€ said Mike Ahearn, First Solar chief executive officer. â€œFirst Solar is proud to be leading the way toward clean, affordable solar electricity as a viable alternative to fossil fuels.â€

> First Solar began full commercial operation of its initial manufacturing line in late 2004. From 2004 through today, manufacturing capacity has grown 2,500 percent to more than 500 megawatts in 2008. First Solarâ€™s annual production capacity will double in 2009 to more than 1 gigawatt, the equivalent of an average-sized nuclear power plant. These escalating volumes have been accompanied by a rapid reduction in manufacturing costs. From 2004 through today, First Solarâ€™s manufacturing costs have declined two-thirds from over $3 per watt to less than $1 per watt. First Solar is confident that further significant cost reductions are possible based on the yet untapped potential of its technology and manufacturing process.

> First Solar is not only committed to making solar power affordable but also to making it environmentally sustainable. The Company takes responsibility for its products throughout their life cycle, ensuring that First Solar modules have the smallest carbon footprint of any current photovoltaic (PV) technology. First Solar is proud to have the industryâ€™s first and only comprehensive pre-funded, end-of-life module collection and recycling program, recycling more than 90 percent of each collected module into new products.

> Ahearn expressed thanks to governments in Germany and other countries for making todayâ€™s milestone possible. â€œWithout forward-looking government programs supporting solar electricity, we would not have been able to invest in the capacity expansion which gives us the scale to bring costs down,â€ he said. â€œFirst Solarâ€™s ongoing focus on cost reduction enables continued growth even as subsidies decline. In the meantime, those initial investments are paying off in a cleaner environment and in the creation of thousands of jobs with a clear future.â€

> â€œThis represents a major milestone for the solar industry,â€ said Ken Zweibel, an industry veteran currently serving as Director of the Institute for the Analysis of Solar Energy at The George Washington University and former Program Leader for the Thin Film Partnership Program at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo. â€œIn order to address climate change in a meaningful way, we need energy technologies that are affordable, scalable and have a low environmental impact on a life-cycle basis. With this announcement, First Solar continues to demonstrate the ability of thin film PV technology to provide an alternative to traditional fossil fuels and for solar power to provide a meaningful contribution in addressing climate change."

11. SOLAR POWER: Utility breaks ground on first Sunshine State PV project(02/26/2009)

Michael Burnham, E&E senior reporter

Florida Power & Light Co. broke ground today on a 25-megawatt solar power plant, the Sunshine State's first commerical-scale photovoltaic array.

When completed later this year, the project will consist of 90,000 photovoltaic panels on 180 acres located halfway between Tampa Bay and Lake Okeechobee. Florida Power & Light, a subsidiary of FPL Group Inc. (NYSE: FPL), will own and operate the DeSoto County project.

"Solar power will help promote a new clean-energy economy in Florida, reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and address climate change through the production of emissions-free energy," FPL Group President Jim Robo said of the $173 million project, which will generate enough electricity for roughly 3,000 homes.

The DeSoto project is one of three solar power installations FPL has in the pipeline.

In December, the Miami-based utility broke ground on a 75 MW solar-thermal array adjacent to the company's combined-cycle power plant in Martin County, east of Lake Okeechobee. The array of 180,000 mirrors, slated for completion next year, will concentrate sunlight on water to produce steam that will offset the natural gas that is currently used in the adjacent combined-cycle plant.

Florida Power & Light plans to break ground on the third project -- a 10 MW array of PV panels -- in Cape Canaveral later this year.

The three solar projects will have the capacity to produce 110 MW and cost roughly $700 million to build, collectively. The utility will pass the cost along to ratepayers over 25 years, which means the typical residential customer will see a 31-cent increase in his monthly utility bill, explained Jackie Anderson, a Florida Power & Light spokeswoman.

A draft study conducted by Navigant Consulting for the Florida Public Service Commission estimated that Florida could support 89,000 MW of solar photovoltaic panels on rooftops and the ground. The state could support another 380 MW of hybrid solar-thermal/combined-cycle power plants.

Florida Gov. Charlie Crist (R) has called for the state to get 20 percent of its electricity from the sun and other renewable resources by 2020. The Florida Public Service Commission is developing a draft renewable portfolio standard for the Legislature to consider later this year.

Lawmakers ask coal-fired plant near Capitol to switch to gas

<http://www.mcclatchydc.com/reg-bin/int.cgi?mode=login&version=login_split> 

By Renee Schoof | McClatchy Newspapers

WASHINGTON â€” Four days before a planned civil disobedience action at a coal-fired power plant near the U.S. Capitol, the leaders of the House of Representatives and the Senate asked Thursday for the plant to replace all its coal with natural gas.

Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., the Senate majority leader, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., sent a letter to Stephen Ayers, the acting architect of the Capitol, who's in charge of maintaining the Capitol complex, telling him to reduce the amount of coal burned at the plant and to prepare for converting it to burn only natural gas by the end of the year.

The power plant, three blocks south of the Capitol, has been running every day since it went into service in 1910. It provides heating and cooling for the Capitol, the Library of Congress and about 20 other federal buildings on Capitol Hill, using both coal and natural gas.

The plant is the No. 1 source of air pollution and carbon pollution in the nation's capital, the letter said.

For environmental activists it's something more, however â€” a symbol of the nation's reliance on coal, the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel. Scientists have identified heat-trapping carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels as the primary reason for the increase in Earth's average temperature in recent decades.

Capitol Climate Action, a coalition of environmental and other advocacy groups, plans to hold a civil disobedience demonstration at the plant on Monday, capping PowerShift, a national conference of young environmentalists in Washington.

"I think it's time we take a stand on global warming. We need to send a message to Congress and the president," NASA climate scientist James Hansen said in a video message to participants on YouTube. He plans to join the protest.

"What has become clear from the science is we cannot burn all the fossil fuels without creating a very different planet," Hansen said. "The only practical way to solve the problem is to phase out the biggest source of carbon and that is coal."

Nell Greenberg, a spokeswoman for Capitol Climate Action, said the demonstration would call for broader action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Pelosi and Reid asked the Architect of the Capitol to provide information about what it would cost to retrofit the plant's two boilers to operate entirely on natural gas. They said they want one of them converted as early as this summer and the other by year's end.

The office of the Architect of the Capitol is committed to increasing energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint, and planning is under way "to make this a reality," said spokeswoman Eva Malecki.

The power plant was the last step, "right under the nose" of Congress and an example of a way to quickly move away from coal, said Bruce Nilles of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign.

Getting rid of the coal is important not just for global warming but also for health, Nilles said.

"The day before the inauguration was a Code Orange day" because of high pollution, he said. "It was a lousy way to welcome the first family, which has one asthmatic daughter."

Hello Fred,

I thought you might be interested in this short article from yesterday's Wilmington, NC, paper, about the legal work to impose mercury controls on cement plants led by Jim Pew of the Earthjustice office in DC.

Best,

Trip

After long battle, new mercury rules coming from EPA

For Jim Pew, the lawsuits start blending together.
An attorney with the environmental law firm Earthjustice, Pew has been front and center in the convoluted legal battle to regulate mercury emissions from the nationâ€™s cement plants.
Since the 1990s, Pew and other environmentalists have accused the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of dragging its feet to regulate an industry with â€œenormous clout.â€
That battle may end March 31. On that day, the EPA is scheduled to release new mercury pollution standards for cement plants, the result of a settlement agreement that ended the latest lawsuit.
â€œAfter three different - maybe four different â€“ lawsuits, EPA is apparently going to propose some mercury standards,â€ Pew said. â€œI hope thatâ€™s true. Iâ€™m not betting the farm on it, but Iâ€™m cautiously hopeful.â€
The EPA has existing mercury regulations in place, but only for plants built after December 2005. That means the vast majority of the nationâ€™s cement kilns have basically no obligation to reduce their mercury footprint, Pew said.
That resulted in the latest lawsuit, filed in 2007 by environmental groups and the attorneys general of nine states, arguing that the EPA had a legal obligation to regulate mercury pollution from these plants.
Titan Americaâ€™s proposed plant would fall under the existing regulations. Under the current rules, Titanâ€™s proposed plant could release as much as 263 pounds of mercury per year.
Titan officials have also said they will submit to more stringent new rules.
The EPA has released few details on the regulations it will impose, so itâ€™s unclear how they could potentially affect mercury emissions from Titanâ€™s plant.
But rules are coming, said Cathy Milbourn, an EPA spokeswoman.
â€œWe have a court order deadline to have new regulations out by March 31,â€ she said.
Leaders of the Portland Cement Association, an industry group that represents cement companies, said they want to ensure that any rules balance environmental concerns with the need for a viable cement industry.
â€œThe industry is not doing well right now,â€ Andy Oâ€™Hare, vice president of the associationâ€™s regulatory affairs, told the Associated Press. â€œA good chunk of the U.S. cement production capacity is shut down because of market circumstances. Weâ€™re certainly not looking to add to our costs.â€
The U.S. cement industry releases roughly 12,000 pounds of mercury each year, according to the EPAâ€™s toxic release data. Two environmental groups, Earthjustice and the Environmental Integrity Project, released a report last year that said cement plants actually release nearly 23,000 pounds of mercury each year.

Duke study advises against corn biofuel


Duke University News Service
The Herald-Sun
Mar 8, 2009

DURHAM -- To avoid creating greenhouse gases, it makes more sense using today's technology to leave land unfarmed in conservation reserves than to plow it up for corn to make biofuel, according to a comprehensive Duke University-led study.

"Converting set-asides to corn-ethanol production is an inefficient and expensive greenhouse gas mitigation policy that should not be encouraged until ethanol-production technologies improve," the study's authors reported in the March edition of the research journal Ecological Applications.

Nevertheless, farmers and producers are already receiving federal subsidies to grow more corn for ethanol under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.

"One of our take-home messages is that conservation programs are currently a cheaper and more efficient greenhouse gas policy for taxpayers than corn-ethanol production," said biologist Robert Jackson, the Nicholas Professor of Global Environmental Change at Duke's Nicholas School of the Environment, who led the study.

Making ethanol from corn reduces atmospheric releases of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide because the CO2 emitted when the ethanol burns is "canceled out" by the carbon dioxide taken in by the next crop of growing plants, which use it in photosynthesis. That means equivalent amounts of carbon dioxide are removed from the atmosphere and "fixed" into plant tissues.

But the study notes that some CO2 not counterbalanced by plant carbon uptake gets released when corn is grown and processed for ethanol. Furthermore, ethanol contains only about 70 percent of gasoline's energy.

"So we actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions only 20 percent when we substitute one liter of ethanol for one liter of gasoline," said Gervasio Piâ??±eiro, the study's first author, who is a Buenos Aires, Argentina-based scientist and postdoctoral research associate in Jackson's Duke laboratory.

Also, by the researchers' accounting, the carbon benefits of using ethanol only begin to show up years after corn growing begins. "Depending on prior land use" they wrote in their report, "our analysis shows that carbon releases from the soil after planting corn for ethanol may in some cases completely offset carbon gains attributed to biofuel generation for at least 50 years."

The report said that "cellulosic" species -- such as switchgrass -- are a better option for curbing emissions than corn because they don't require annual replowing and planting. In contrast, a single planting of cellulosic species will continue growing and producing for years while trapping more carbon in the soil.

"Until cellulosic ethanol production is feasible, or corn-ethanol technology improves, corn-ethanol subsidies are a poor investment economically and environmentally," Jackson added.

However, the report noted that a cost-effective technology to convert cellulosics to ethanol may be years away. So the Duke team contrasted today's production practices for corn-based ethanol with what will be possible after the year 2023 for cellulosic-based ethanol.

By analyzing 142 different soil studies, the researchers found that conventional corn farming can remove 30 to 50 percent of the carbon stored in the soil. In contrast, cellulosic ethanol production entails mowing plants as they grow -- often on land that is already in conservation reserve. That, their analysis found, can ultimately increase soil carbon levels between 30 to 50 percent instead of reducing them.

"It's like hay baling," Piâ??±eiro said. "You plant it once and it stays there for 20 years. And it takes much less energy and carbon dioxide emissions to produce that than to produce corn."

A nationwide study - the first to document the long-term impact of ozone on human health.



On todayâ€™s NPR â€œAll Things Concernedâ€ you can hear the audio here after 7pm:
<http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=2>http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=2



Smoggy Skies May Cause Respiratory Death

The New England Journal of Medicine

 All Things Considered, March 11, 2009 Â· People living in the smoggiest cities are 30 percent more likely to die from respiratory diseases, including pneumonia than those living in the least smoggy areas, according to a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine.



The nationwide study of 450,000 adults is the first to document the long-term impact of ozone on human health.



It's estimated that 100 million Americans â€” or one in three â€” live in cities with unhealthy levels of ground-level. Ground level ozone â€” the major component of smog â€” forms when tailpipe emissions combine with sun and hot air. Smog season runs from April through October in Southern California, and is slightly shorter in cooler regions of the country, such as the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states.



Dangers Of Ozone



Researchers and physicians have known for many decades that spikes in air pollution during the summer months cause health problems. Asthmatics experience more flare-ups and there are more hospital admissions for respiratory ailments and heart-attacks.



The new study provides the first evidence that long-term, chronic exposure to elevated levels of ozone significantly increases the risk of death from respiratory diseases.



"The study points to the fact that there may be a three-fold increased risk of dying from respiratory disease in the smoggiest areas of the country," says Dr. John Balmes of the University of California, San Francisco.



The adults in the study, originally recruited by the American Cancer Society, were tracked for 18 years. During this time about 118,000 people died. Michael Jerrett, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues then teased out the causes of death. They documented that people living in the smoggiest cities were more likely to have died from lung diseases such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema and pneumonia.



Jerrett and his team controlled for 44 individual factors that may have influenced the results, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, occupational exposures, unemployment status and income. But even after that, he says, "We still see a very strong and clear signal that people in high-ozone areas are at higher risk of death."



Limiting Smog



During the summer smog season, people with respiratory conditions such as asthma are told to stay indoors. And some cities offer free public transportation on days when ozones level are extremely high.



But other than staying indoors, there are few ways to limit chronic, cumulative exposures.



"We know that ozone causes inflammation of the airways," explains Dr. John Balmes. "And that chemical burning makes people more susceptible to infectious agents like viruses and bacteria that cause pneumonia."



If people are interested in reducing smog, experts say the best thing they can do is to drive less, especially during the summer months.



Most emissions in the smoggiest cities come from cars and other vehicles.



Another way to cut ozone is to change federal regulations. Current clean air laws, which helped reduce smog throughout the '80s and '90s, were aimed at preventing summer-time spikes.



"The law of the land restricts the peak levels on the highest days of the year," explains George Thurston of New York University's Langone Medical Center.



Given the new evidence, advocates will likely push for a new "annual average" standard that aims at further reducing the overall burden of smog.

Researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) have published a suite of papers in ES&T that elucidate the availability of mercury in streams and how it makes its way into fish and other life-forms in these dynamic ecosystems. The three papers (DOI <http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es802694n>10.1021/es802694n, <http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es802698v>10.1021/es802698v, and <http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es8027567>10.1021/es8027567) represent one of the most comprehensive studies of stream mercury dynamics, and they hint at answers to many of the questions raised by previous research.

Although <http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es072437d>other research has looked at mercury in stream systems, most studies of the formation of methylmercury and how it gets into fish have been done on lakes, a much more placid environment. This new suite of papers summarizes results from a multiyear <http://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/mercury/>study of eight U.S. streams in three states representing different geographic zones<http://pubs.acs.org/entityImage/?code=E5F8><http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2008/1277/>Florida, Oregon, and Wisconsin<http://pubs.acs.org/entityImage/?code=E5F8>as well as urban and less developed settings.

Led by Mark Brigham, a geochemist at USGS who is lead author of one of the papers, the researchers tracked proxies for mercury availability and methylation, such as dissolved organic carbon and sulfur levels in sediments. They also looked at mercury concentrations in different predator fish by moving up the food chain from algae to the insects and small fish the predators eat.

Over a 4-year period, the researchers sampled one urban stream and one or two less developed streams in each state. They took water samples near stream gauges to assess the variability of flow and water inputs, and they took sediment samples throughout each streamâ€™s course. They also collected enough fish and insects of different species and in various seasons to represent an entire food web for each stream. For all of these samples, the researchers measured total mercury, methylmercury, dissolved organic carbon, and other markers. For biota, they tracked C and N isotopes to find the life-formsâ€™ places in the food chain.

Each of the papers points to three key findings. First, the entire catchment (all the spots that supply water to the stream) is critical in determining mercury and methylmercury flux to the streams; this is particularly true in catchments with more wetlands. Second, the availability of carbon and mercury and the setting in which they are available to bacteria that methylate mercury are important. However, methylmercury concentrations in sediments may not match concentrations present in the water flowing above, which highlights the importance of upstream inputs. And third, whatâ€™s in the water seems to have the biggest impact on the levels of mercury that appear in higher trophic levels, from invertebrates to midlevel and predator fish.

â€œThat supply of methylmercury to the base of the food web is going to be the driver to what you see in the top predator fish,â€ says Lia Chasar of USGS, a coauthor of one of the papers. And â€œitâ€™s not just supply, but how available it is to the critters.â€ That availability varies with the different watershed characteristics and settings that the team studied. For example, â€œnot all DOC [dissolved organic carbon] is the same,â€ she says, and carbon availability in a stream in Florida will be different from that of a stream in Oregon.

The findings do not change the impact of mercury deposited in an ecosystem: more mercury delivered to a stream or lake means that more mercury ends up in fish. To clarify that process, this project determined which variables control the differences in the mercury levels in fish across systems that receive their mercury via atmospheric deposition, says <http://fwcb.cfans.umn.edu/personnel/faculty/swain.php>Edward Swain of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. The team â€œidentifies landscapes that are sensitive, or more vulnerable, to mercury deposition,â€ Swain adds.

â€œVariations in ecosystem properties that govern methylmercury production in an ecosystem are probably much more important [in determining which ecosystems have high methylmercury in fish] than the variation of mercury deposition across the country,â€ comments Brigham. â€œWetlands abundance in a watershed keeps on popping up as an important factor,â€ he says. The team found that although mercury concentrations are magnified with each step up the food web, the transfer of mercury through each trophic level occurs at a fairly consistent rate across streams.

â€œNot one of these [pieces of the system] is the dominating factor, but each one of these is important,â€ says Christopher Knightes, a researcher and mercury modeler at the U.S. EPAâ€™s National Exposure Research Laboratory in Athens, Ga. â€œWhat weâ€™re ultimately concerned about is methylmercury in the fish.â€

The project is â€œan empirical correlation study, with the strength of covering many different systems and doing all the statistical work,â€ Knightes continues. â€œIt doesnâ€™t tell you the cause, but tells you the correlationsâ€ of where and how mercury will be present and where it will bioaccumulate in fish. It sets the stage, he says, for future mechanistic work to explain exactly what happens in this relatively new arena. These data and correlations also will inform the models that EPA continues to develop for the total maximum daily load program, related to mercury in streams.

â€œThe strength of this study is that theyâ€™ve got a lot of data from a lot of sites, and the data are integratedâ€ across those streams, comments <http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/driscoll/personal/index.asp>Charles Driscoll of Syracuse University. The team also took care to choose streams that did not receive mercury directly, for example, from mining waste. Only mercury carried by air or rain enters these streams or is deposited in their catchment areas. The study confirms what has been reported in bits and pieces before: â€œDeposition is important, but itâ€™s not an overriding factor. The landscape characteristics are really determining mercury transport and chemistryâ€ in streams, Driscoll says.

To control mercury levels in fish, ideally there must be a way to control mercury emissions coming from coal-fired power plants, smelters, and other sources, Driscoll says. Yet several mitigating factors are also at work, as shown by the differences the USGS team found in urban versus nonurban streams. Most people would expect more mercury in fish in urban streams, but the new research indicates that thatâ€™s not the case. For example, in urban streams, mercury isnâ€™t available to biota because of the relatively high sulfur and sulfate levels, which seem to bind up the available mercury, as indicated in <http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es802698v>the paper by Mark Marvin-DiPasquale et al.

By pinpointing the conditions of an ecosystem that could make it sensitive to mercury cycles, researchers could influence policy making related to mercury sources such as power plants. In February, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case about EPAâ€™s Clean Air Mercury Rule, which was finalized in 2005. This decision allows EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson to consider new mercury-control strategies and standards to protect the environment. â€œThe results from this project are timely and relevant for policy makers at U.S. EPA,â€ points out USGS team member David Krabbenhoft, a coauthor of two of the papers.

The USGS scientists took a truly â€œbiogeochemical approach to seeing why certain streams have higher levels of mercury in them, where it is being produced, and how itâ€™s being accumulated in the food web,â€ says <http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/faculty/vincent_stlouis/>Vincent St. Louis, a biologist at the University of Alberta (Canada). â€œThis kind of [research] has long been needed. The focus has been on lakes all these years and on oceans, and not a lot of good broad-scale studies have been done on <http://pubs.acs.org/journal/doi/abs/10.1021/es803138z>streams. [The three papers are] a strong body of evidence that people will be referencing for a long time.â€

Keeping Overheads so far Down, Theyâ€™re Underground

March 20, 2009
We automatically think, in this country, that if power needs to be sent from generating station A to a town rejoicing under the name of B, then some line joining the two points must be sown with large metal skeletons keeping high-voltage wires safely above our heads.

It ainâ€™t necessarily so.  Thomas Blakeslee of Clearlight Foundation, writing in RenewableEnergyWorld.com, makes the case that using high-voltage DC instead of AC and burying the cables underground can cost the same or less than stringing them through the sky, for four reasons:

> 1. The electronic voltage converters required by HVDC grids (which are the kind we will need for the national backbone described in the above article) are no longer cost-prohibitive, thanks to falling semiconductor prices.


> 2. Costs for AC transformers, land and steel are rising dramatically.


> 3. DC transmission requires two cables, AC three.


> 4. Planning to bury cables along existing rights of way instead of proposing to mar landscapes with towers will likely avoid years of expensive legal battles with environmental and local citizensâ€™ groups.

That last reason may sound conjectural, but no-one who has been involved in the permitting process for an energy project of any size can doubt its basic verisimilitude.  Itâ€™s not hard to imagine that legal fees and cost overruns induced by delays in permitting could easily exceed the disparity between above-ground and below-ground construction costs.  And if the project in question happens to be the supergrid described in the previous article, using what appears to be the more expensive (underground) route to connect CSP output to load centers half-way across the country could well turn out to be the fastest, cheapest option.

You can read Blakesleeâ€™s full article <http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/03/invisible-underground-hvdc-power-costs-no-more-than-ugly-towers>here.

Distance also plays a role in this cost analysis.  ABB, the huge Swiss-based power and automation technology group, estimates that for distances greater than about 500 kms, the use of underground (and submarine) cables for its <http://www.abb.com/hvdc>HVDC Light technology would only cost about 10% to 20% more than overhead linesâ€”even without accounting for permitting/legal delays.   Itâ€™s an option thatâ€™s evidently being seriously considered overseas, and should be here.

> March 23, 2009 | The popular urge to claw back the bogus bonuses paid by American International Group is irresistible and fully justified, but should the Treasury someday retrieve every single bonus dollar, that total of $165 million will make no difference to anyone except a few disgruntled traders. From the jaded perspective of the financiers, the uproar over the AIG bonuses may provide a welcome distraction from far more important (and lucrative) abuses in the world's offshore tax havens.

> So rather than continue arguing over chump change, it is long past time for the United States, with its international friends and allies, to demand accountability from the long list of tiny countries and principalities, from Andorra and the Cayman Islands to Singapore and Switzerland, where corporations, wealthy clients and unrepentant evildoers hide their assets.

> The big claw-back will reach into quaint islands and mountainous principalities, because the same banks, hedge funds and private equity firms responsible for the world financial meltdown keep their profits in those "secrecy spaces" -- alongside the ill-gotten gains of numerous drug dealers, dictators and delinquents of every description.

> According to the Government Accountability Office, <http://www.globalpolicy.org/nations/launder/haven/2008/12GAOReport.pdf>nearly all of America's top 100 corporations maintain subsidiaries in countries identified as tax havens. As the GAO notes, there could be reasons other than avoiding the IRS to set up branches in places such as Singapore, Luxembourg and Switzerland, where taxes are light or nonexistent and keeping clients' illicit secrets is considered a matter of national pride.

> But what reason other than evasion could there be for Goldman Sachs Group to set up three subsidiaries in Bermuda, five in Mauritius, and 15 in the Cayman Islands? Why did Countrywide Financial need two subsidiaries in Guernsey? Why did Wachovia need 18 subsidiaries in Bermuda, three in the British Virgin Islands, and 16 in the Caymans? Why did Lehman Brothers need 31 subsidiaries in the Caymans? What do Bank of America's 59 subsidiaries in the Caymans actually do? Why does Citigroup need 427 separate subsidiaries in tax havens, including 12 in the Channel Islands, 21 in Jersey, 91 in Luxembourg, 19 in Bermuda and 90 in the Caymans? What exactly is going on at Morgan Stanley's 19 subs in Jersey, 29 subs in Luxembourg, 14 subs in the Marshall Islands, and its amazing 158 subs in the Caymans? And speaking of AIG, why does it have 18 subs in tax-haven countries? (Don't expect to find out from Fox News Channel or the New York Post, because News Corp. has its own constellation of strange subsidiaries, including 33 in the Caymans alone.)

> When the cost of these shenanigans was last estimated two years ago, the U.S. government's annual loss in revenue due to tax avoidance by major corporations and super-rich individuals was pegged at about $100 billion -- considerably more than a rounding error, even today. But of course that is only a rough assessment, as is the estimate of $12 trillion in untaxed assets hidden around the world. Nobody will know for certain until the books are opened and transparency is established.

> Whatever the accurate accounting proves to be, it is certain to exceed hundreds of billions annually worldwide. That is money every country will need badly for years, to repay debt, finance reconstruction, and fund services, as the world economy struggles to revive itself. Even in the developing countries, where incomes are much lower and billionaires tend to be scarce, the annual revenue loss could be as much as $50 billion -- enough to meet the U.N.'s <http://www.worldbank.org/html/extdr/mdgassessment.pdf>Millennium Development Goals (if only the money were not stolen by local elites and wired away to numbered accounts in tax havens).

> None of these tax havens could exist without the connivance or at least the cooperation of the world's most powerful governments, which remain dominated by financial industry lobbyists even now. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has sought greater transparency from the tax havens for years, hearing promises from most and defiance from a few.

> But in reality almost nothing was accomplished until last year, when U.S. law enforcement authorities began to pursue <http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/11/12/business/ubs.php>Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) executives with criminal indictments. The UBS probe <http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/tre51i1l7-us-ubs/>led to a settlement last month that included a fine of $780 million and an agreement to provide information about tens of thousands of American clients maintaining secret accounts at that huge bank.

> Over the past several years, however, the trend has gone the other way, with abuse of bank secrecy and the expatriation of investment and profits growing rapidly. On the tiny island of Jersey in the English Channel, for instance, the authorities responded to political pressure from hedge funds, which have placed more than $80 billion in deposits there, by establishing a <http://www.globalpolicy.org/nations/launder/haven/2007/0929hedge.htm>"zero regulation regime" last year that literally removed all restrictions and reporting on financial transactions. Jersey's counterparts in Guernsey and the Cayman Islands responded by assuring the hedge funds that they, too, would consider abolishing all regulation.
